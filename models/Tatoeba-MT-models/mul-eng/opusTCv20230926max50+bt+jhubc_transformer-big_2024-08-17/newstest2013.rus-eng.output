Republican strategy to resist Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight falsifications in the election.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latest myth, claiming that falsifications in elections in the United States are rarer than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers accounted for only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most of the State Governments since 2009 have passed laws that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon gained new prominence after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in just one year in 2011, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were passed.
The new election laws require the voter to present a photo ID and proof of the existence of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the voter’s right to register on the day of the election, and deprive the citizens of the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law passed in India.
The Republican authorities have rushed to spread this practice to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills that require voters to present photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government body.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 percent of African Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 percent of citizens over 65, and 20 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 don’t have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are believed to be voting for Democratic candidates, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photo issued by their educational institution.
However, these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificate issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship for voting.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin American voters. . . .
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This restriction has not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of early-voting voters were African-Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s total number of voters.
The same thing happened with Latin American immigrants as well.
With only 11% of the electorate, they were 24% of the citizens who voted prematurely.
Unlike whites, who make up 76% of voters, only 46% of those who voted prematurely.
Of course, Democrats and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been vetoed by Democratic governors.
The operation of the most ambiguous laws was suspended with the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the filing of a photo ID.
However, the new rules that have come into force will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics of Democrats condemn the bias of laws that have been passed, seeing them as an obvious direction to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening of prostate cancer: to pass a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives false results, false results, and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical intervention.
For men, and so unwillingly passing dispensary, there is much more to be doubted.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among groups of subjects, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different levels of mortality in patients who went through screening and those who didn’t.
This study also showed, after a 12-year follow-up, that the likelihood of metastasis occurring is 30-40% higher in those who did not screen.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test from age 50 or 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and virulent.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, but by making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active observation of the disease.
To date, many men who have cancer will not undergo a course of treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
More and more often, we accurately define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo the course of treatment.
Therefore, I would recommend that you take the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool that allows you to evaluate everything for and against passing the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, adherence to a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, that figure would have increased to at least 50 percent,” Andre Bolier, the Canadian Cancer Association’s press secretary, said in a statement.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are hereditary.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
This is a risk factor for many others.
It does a huge harm to people’s health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said Andre Bolye, the press secretary.
The encouraging fact is that after 10 years of quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weight
According to CAR data, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the association adds.
Feeding
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of developing colon cancer.
Also, sausage products should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by tapping, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can harm the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” the association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at the moment the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of vitamin D cancer, there is also no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Bolyo stresses that it is important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"Success of analysis does not lead to cancer."
Boson Higgs in detail
Last summer’s report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused a real excitement – and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much.
Moreover, this is the last particle whose existence has been predicted within the Standard Model—our best, or, at least, the “least imperfect” description of nature and the behavior of matter—but which has not previously been able to be discovered by experience.
But physicists aren’t quite sure that it’s the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although for the full assurance of some data is not yet available.
Let’s imagine, though, that it’s about the Higgs boson, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and let’s see what that means.
There is a law in this world that says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule there is no possibility, even do not try too hard, otherwise harm yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of this kind: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which posits that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, that they are in the same state, that they are not in the same state, that they are in the same state.
On the basis of this, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find well-ordered citizens, called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
In another, there are bosons, a vicious gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least for this principle, which means that they can quietly be in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, quite unusual) of Berkeley’s Particle Adventure Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the mesons that we will not talk about here, and the “parts of the force” through which the main forces of nature are spread by the boson and to whom.
These same bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic beings as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it’s thanks to one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or “part of the light,” which is the “currier” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disrupts” the electromagnetic field at that particular location, about like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "infringement" an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of "power transmitters".
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, you need to reach very and very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be rocked by a very large rock.
That’s why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that’s being operated at CERN – the Big Adron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! – to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never be kept in the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photons, by the way) do not.
So what can all these studies "bring", Mrs. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to check the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to find a difference between the results of observations and SM forecasts.
In addition, some of them are passionately longing for such a discrepancy to be discovered, because the slightest inconsistency can open the door to "new physics" and close some of the Model's holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws, without offering any explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But so far, no such differences have been found in CERN.
Consequences
The benefit of these studies for the average person’s daily life is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
In the early 60’s, pioneers of laser research in Bell’s labs couldn’t even guess what revolution their work would bring.
They envisioned their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the already deceased physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where in 1960 a laser was invented, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was "considered as soon as possible."
Imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the instrumentation accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, though not at all its original purpose, now serves as an “eye” for all the world’s digital cameras and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... <0x7C> "Duty"
The Commission on Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume soon, and the bill is being drafted at this time.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
"Dog" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Still lived in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a two-year delay.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of Victor Gadbua's palliative care in Belya, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow you to go to the toilet on your own and even eat on your own.
Sitting at the table where he is having an appetizing dinner, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before the ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, staff found a cure for the disease.
“During our lives, we are taught that a man should urinate standing,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbue’s shelter.
Regression to the state of the child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on a person’s ability to reconcile with a decline,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur at the height of this decline.
Patients who enter the palliative care facility of Viktor Gadbua are all cancer patients.
The forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more help, called “medicinal”.
Mrs. A., 89, is most afraid of dying "in the mind of the breath."
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in life anymore,” she says, before letting her put on a mask that makes breathing easier.
She is still waiting for the next few days for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In the shelter of Viktor Gadbua, a group of volunteers provide care for the body and assistance in feeding.
This is palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
This is very little given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it’s physical, emotional, or mental comfort.
We will agree to provide the dying person with mouthwashes made of brandy or peps, seeing as he will request.
Diabetics are no longer under the control of sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
In the morning his son touched this beer in the legs of the deceased.
“We are helping close people, as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the shelter of Victor Gadbua, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, lying on his pillow during a toast in his honor, tragically dies a young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children and tries everything to get away.
“In the last six months, between three and five coke, cancer patients under the age of 45 have always been busy,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor Gadbua’s hospital come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is provided to ease the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbua shelter and the Society of Palliative Care at the home of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec’s health care system that forces many doctors – specialists in palliative care – to be afraid of adopting a law that legalizes euthanasia and assists in suicide.
Starting in October, the manifesto, signed by the palliative care lights, is circulated by Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant and testifies to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients despite pessimistic predictions.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard were already minimal when she stopped the debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she said she would be sorry that I was quitting the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered.
There is no all-encompassing care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death are grateful to the medical staff for not complying with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsi Monroe, director of palliative care in the Society of palliative care at the home of Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or permanently.
It is no longer possible to pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Pain sufferers always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to be easier.”
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to a journalist’s grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec City
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and experts on the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal “system” that is impeding the construction industry, civil servants, and defiancers.
"Industry", which was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
“It’s interesting how this system breaks down after all the funds have been put into action,” joked Jacques Dusseno, a deputy and former Montreal police chief.
It was thanks to him that the scandal erupted in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Share, reluctantly agreed to.
The Dushen Report has established a direct link between industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, only the Ministry of Transport would have kept a billion dollars in contracts,” he said, “if some had kept their instincts from taking a share.
Charbonno’s commission “has already moved two mayors,” he adds, hoping that she will be able to “hide the schemes behind individual individuals.”
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Molot", which after 2009 forced the "city cartel" of Montreal, to stop the overvaluation of the contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out over the past few weeks, and some municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
The next in line is Gil Waiyankur, who recently resigned from the post of Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, the official indictment was presented to several engineers of the Montreal Communications Service and contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded a real bomb, reporting an investigation into the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who, in turn, translated the money of the party of mayor Gerald Trumple's "United Montreal".
In the 2000s, Zambito shoved money right and left. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parts of the province, mostly liberals, who were then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party of Natali Normando.
Sanitation contracts in which the value was exceeded
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked irrevocably.
Jill Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described her in detail before the commission: in ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a bribe of $36 000 in total.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they had received a pawn, exceeding the bill by 30-40% with the help of false additions.
Then one organizer from the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trump of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party’s cash with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trump resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of the district of Riviera de Preri in the east of the island, she has opposed the sale since 2010 of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million builders in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of the money spent on election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be started, she will "strain behind a thread that allows to understand the functioning of the ants-infested system to stop the gangrene and identify the culprits."
This process is described as “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid returning to questionable practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "electoral officials who knew about this scheme" but did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the election campaign in Quebec is 70%, he joked: “I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit the donation to $100, but he said it would not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit the election costs, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It calls for a complete overhaul of the system of providing state contracts and party financing: “We can’t go down below; by boldly penetrating into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchenne calls on those who laugh, to look into his own yard ...
"It's not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have reached an extraordinary height at PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors force me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not getting burned.
From the very beginning in the pre-preparation center of the NIF in Clerfontein and before my arrival in St. Etienne I always moved forward.
Thus, you are benefiting from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
The addition of this summer is not a novelty to play games of a very high level.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me is eager to be on the level and stand out as much as possible.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my position.
He's helped by substitutes like Claude Maquelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti - the master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti pays respect to all technical personnel.
Today in the First League he is not equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he has won many titles with top-class clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I got away with a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first half of the season?
In the First League, Lyon took the place of leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified for one-eighth final.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can be.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, in order to be able to take the game back in one eighth final.
Will PSG be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget...
In order to become a big European club, Paris needs to win the titles and consolidate its positions in the long run.
That's not the case today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the title in the Premier League, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really looking forward to winning this championship.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that strong teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It’s normal that we expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We're totally ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Trou and we still find something to criticize, of course, it’s a bit frustrating.
The question is, what do people expect from us in the first place?
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement a game plan.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has not been able to make it to the eighth final for two seasons, although they have also spent a lot of money!
Given the amounts invested, we represented you by 15 points ahead of the winter break already.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lion and Marcel, who were not up last season, were “excited” by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of "Golden Dependency."
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is a star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-class star.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Tyago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from wasting a bit of playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I am able to play a good selection of matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to behave as a model.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham in the head of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good standing in the squad for the World Championship.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires victory.
How was Lauren Blanc?
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he has qualified us to the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1) that broke out on October 16 in Spain is a basic match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and Sell Without the Help of Banks – With Bitcoin
The total opposite of the current monetary exchange based on the central banks, the transactions numbered between the receiving parties (c) and the commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, an obvious political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros...) and a protected exchange protocol called BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin’s price, reaching a maximum of $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to about $10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on virtual currency, published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competiting with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to ordinary currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to promote video games that are earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations are always controlled and processed by any central authority.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously bookholders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers, and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between the two users actually takes place between the two e-mail addresses, similar to e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent across the network.
A key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
It is a phase of file hashing, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers will “take” a new transaction and add a number to it before “hashing” it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros in the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of fraud, the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) would like to pay twice the same amount of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the prize is regularly divided into halves, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one stamil, which leaves another reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
“The defect used does not apply to the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant Sales" was announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, a Coinabul employee who is engaged in the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nuez, another author of the grant on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which thus comes out cheaper.
The owner has better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It’s enough just to report an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, says Pierre Nuaz, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“Before Bitcoin is confirmed, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends, by the way, to review the various risks that are considered to be raised today in the event of the success of this system.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying only on us.
We were mainly affected by the Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, let even jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but there will be no more of them as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hills planted by the almond trees thanks to the French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014 there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
The circumstances have changed since their unsurpassed progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood due to the struggle between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the nightmares of these peasants, in which al-Qaida has surpassed them, but their situation has not improved even today.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into deltas taking over state lands to resell them under construction to repatriates returning from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in rural areas, want a government that would not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded in American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
State schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who do not want to return to the nightmares of the old parties, nor to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and which look everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who were fighting the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking steps to restore provincial wives who would not be subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must to some extent be decentralized, by the example of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that has existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth in it.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to take over.
Without energy for processing iron ore or copper in place, without means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no extraction of useful fossils.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary to restore normal relations equally between Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which import and export depend to a large extent.
The withdrawal of the French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: the girls', boys', the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres.
Since 2009 in an effort to "conquer the heart and mind" and to carry out the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, service of "military-civilian activity" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small-scale, multi-purpose French society
These works, with the intensive involvement of the local labor force, were able to help to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in the area of grazing land.
What will we remember about ourselves by spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of small agricultural works originating from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, what the farmers want, as they told me, they need to provide them with a little non-military support that would be well controlled and would come to them directly.
The Hard Births of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a risky move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, it has decided to play a va-bank.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text for the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
It has been two years since Egypt relied on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the country's division.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic edge", continuing to "break the word" and "resist the right".
In the camp, his followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brothers to give up the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, the article after the article.
For the president, this is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for expedited voting goes to the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Whether you vote for my text, or I leave myself with extraordinary powers,” which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order for the required quorum to be reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the article was voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, mocked the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee considered that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were wrong.
The text, on which the vote was still held yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained an identical article of the 1971 Constitution, arguing that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the “principles” with the “rules”, which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Physicianism," answer the liberals, who see this only as a pear.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to checking compliance with Shariah laws.
According to Egypt’s expert Sophie Pomye, this is alarming, because “people who are called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.”
We can observe the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals, in addition, are outraged by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
“There is no specific religious intervention at the moment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema, and people with university education, some have studied in the French system," said Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “there may be ambiguity around Article 220, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious lexicon.
This applies in particular to "fixes" [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to make decisions about this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is subject to criticism, as it gives wide powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have decreased significantly compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the military wishes, the consideration of the defense budget will take place not in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will it be prohibited to prosecute civilians in military courts, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered detrimental to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy has been maintained, and insult has now been banned, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speak more about the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will go out on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the land pop and the sea out of saffron
The Promised Land combines in itself the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and primordial nature.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons for visiting Israel.
We worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the river Jordan, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that for all who enter this “bath” God’s grace descends.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all the sanctuary in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here are on the Path of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria, - where there was a court, and on the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Lord on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of Atonement and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pope of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was raised from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place for the Jews - the Wall of Tears, left by the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave here notes with desires, which are then fulfilled.
Make a trip to the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on suspended rocks in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are interested in mountaineering can get to them by their way.
The rest is delivered to this historical peak by a lift along the cableway.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m there is the famous ski resort Hermon, on which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
To him from the foot of the mountain is delivered by bus-shatl.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to the ancient tradition, the pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don’t go to all of them for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
You should also visit the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition features a wide range of impressionists and expressionists such as Mone, Pissarro, Renouara, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagala, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the Al Ba<0xC5><0x9F>a Bath Museum, which represents several halls of ancient Turkish baths with mules of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea it is worth entering the unique part of the Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section - the children's memorial - is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
They're targeting the stars.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Get well.
Israel’s three main resort areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea they swim even in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not drop below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and there are swimming all year round.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world located at the lowest point of the planet - at 417 m below the ocean level.
The lazure water in it is a sage, easily holding on to the float even those who are not able to swim at all.
The scenery around here is unbelievably beautiful.
They go here to go through the course of treatment using salt water - rapeseed, and healing dirt, and to treat health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring in the order of the swollen veins.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
They are kept in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after the Zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries in the photo session.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can roam the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A tourist on the note
When going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know the Russian language.
The money on the trip is better to take not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
City transport is mostly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and the connecting Lower City with the Upper.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without squid and food, in which milk and meat are combined.
There are a wide selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, balls from the milky nut - falal, fruits and vegetables.
There are no walking dogs in the streets of Israel.
But there are a lot of fed cats that are rolling "walking on their own".
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The Moors love places and do not refuse to worship.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And the bike rental will cost 15 shekels. per day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
Numerical language
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world.
The citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came most to travel and rest.
On the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited, which is 51% more than the same figure in 2010, until the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" to Moscow will lead: migrants are digging money into the language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that the law will give mandatory language testing, fraudsters have already appeared in the country, trading “lipo” certificates.
Every year, 13 million gas tankers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support the families that remain in the homeland.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass the exam on knowledge of the Russian language.
In the meantime, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the field of service, housing and communal economy, housing and retail trade.
However, over time, the tests, promised in the FMS, will become mandatory for all arrivals.
At the same time, you will have to give up not only the language, but also Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for obtaining and for extending the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a state language.
They do not fall under the law and people who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, Condemnation and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of testing was supported by both the deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But the human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have often managed to ask in the press the question: what will this actually give?
What will change the obligation of knowledge of the language for both Russians and for the arrivals themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service say, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from “labor slavery”.
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of working migrants, explains Viktor Sebelev, head of the Russian Embassy in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized set will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems with migrants without a profession, education, who do not know a language, who do not have a medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, - assured Sebelev, - the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people, who, under the guise of help, will push him a "travel" into a rough narrow bar, where he and dozens of others like him will for months to gather without food and documents, squeezing at 12-14 p.m.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“In their homeland, they promise one thing, and upon arrival, they are deceived, they choose their passports, they do not pay the promised salary”, – confirms the head of the Directorate of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be shy, Insurgent!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to make money in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country in which they aspire, but also write on their own with difficulty.
Of course, it’s not as much their fault as the trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even an interpretive initial education.
After all, their families have nothing to feed their children, not to mention to properly dress them, wear them and equip them to school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys, at the very first opportunity, go to earn.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, they admit.
“You feel humiliated and undervalued.”
However, with regard to the law on language, human rights defenders note one important point.
The test will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastrbaiters still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Foreign Entry Banned"
Many of the visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic constraints and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and only for half a thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly fake documents, there is no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They're asking a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Huskadamov, a Tajik citizen, told reporters.
"Come on, don't worry, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was found that it is not only migrant registration documents that are fake.
Several "lip" certificates on the passing of language tests have already been withdrawn by the employees of the FMS.
The separate papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not as a gift: each of the migrants, hoping in this way to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times more expensive than the official testing procedure: it will cost a working migrant three thousand.
The main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that “steps” can not be simply bought, both representatives of the authorities and human rights defenders agree.
While the authorities can promise gastrbaiters who failed to successfully pass the test for the first time, it is time to study the basic language course.
In addition, a foreigner who does not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into account the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to shoot at weddings when there were no casualties, and the battle, organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, resulted in the killing of seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and increase the age from which you can get a gun license - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, and promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be made to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by “circulating the hake”.
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public small-scale organizations - demand to give up the "inconsequential tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer-criminal at the Russian BBS.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies, while in the same period, 1168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not place the criminal to go to the “black” market.
Now, according to them, any weapons can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims that they are in control of the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” arms market is replenished by several channels.
The main such channels are five, says Colonel in the resignation of Viktor Baranets, who spent ten years working in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site accepting orders for weapons
The first is the "army or military trail", that is, the weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were being fired by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets said.
The next type of “black weapon” is stolen by criminals from representatives of power structures.
Baranets explains that this includes those taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal “stealers” go on sale from military warehouses.
There were frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
"There are proven versions that part of the fires were made specifically - to hide the lack," the former military said.
According to Baranza, the manufacturers of weapons are importing their leptut.
“Private weapons factories are now in fruition, which do not stand up to competition in the international market and throw weapons from the ground to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert said.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
There are a lot of guns and machine guns coming from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its production, sometimes bushy, and a mafia was formed that organized the flow,” the former military explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated what the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the “black” market.
The report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public-Government Design.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of the portals on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and power agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are looting at the stage of weapons production, 5% belong to "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked not to name his name, assures that the weapons found by the black miners, no one buys for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, after the new party, the sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through a flagpole, a person buys a unit, for example, a gun TT.
They write it out, they send it through the mailman.
“He transports it to the city and sells it here for 900 euros for a thing with two shops,” he says.
“The truth is, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when a plan for the detection of crimes is burned, they make a check purchase from the dealers with illegal weapons,” the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at the sites, at the blogs, until a friend who offered to come to the platform “Run”, where there will be a person who will take me to the “corner” where we will trade.
I only knew the price of the gun there.
Military Observer Victor Baranets
"To get a gun, I need a guy who has an outlet," says the sales consultant. "I have a guy I know, but I'm not sure.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell that his daughter had a tooth fell out."
I'm now even getting a couple of castes through a person I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't sell him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he prepared an article about it for publication.
The plans, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos where there was "anything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranza, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, don’t just buy – we go with the seller to the forest, there we put the target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I’m convinced that the weapons are beating well, we start trading,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Internet search engines take to sites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
You do not need any documents or personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," - wrote in the advertising cap on the site "Buy a combat gun or machine".
Users leave their applications on it and ask questions.
Will they be sold to minors?
"Without a license, of course" - asks the user "Ivan" (orthography preserved).
"Buy TT.Moscow" - laconicly formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of fake sites and those who want to buy weapons with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military Observer and Former Military Victor Baranets
I have heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instruction where the weapons are hidden," says Dmitry Kislov, press secretary of the public organization "Right to arms".
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the site, you can stay without weapons and get behind the grid.

Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can deposit an amount of from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization "Right to Arms", Makarov's gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
I'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is unloaded from the warehouses of long storage by the guidance of these warehouses of the middle link.
According to official statistics of the department, compared to January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in general in Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22,9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives was 7 percent.
Fast Food Workers and Supermarkets in the U.S.
Through work on the McDonald's cash register, up to a quarter of all U.S. teenagers pass
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart’s universities and restaurants of popular fast-food networks such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendys and Kentucky Fried.
So far, no one has been able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave, or whether it is destined to break out in the early stages.
The shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that Walmart’s regular workers and fast-food systems receive, the aim of the organizers of the protests is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday,” when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, capturing millions of regulars and sometimes accompanied by floods.
On this day, some employees of Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picnicked together with trade unions and left-wing activists of the corporation’s store, whose goods are designed for people of modest and medium income.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles, and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs, and milk.
Products in its stores are on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paying Walmart employees only work from home.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow itself to sell the product to a hanger in part because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain of severe working conditions, for example, the lack of autoloaders or hand scanners.
The participants in the shares on Black Friday demanded an increase in wages and were betting that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker, receiving $9.5 an hour, said the expense was not in his pocket.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have proven that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on salary right now.
If Walmart completely shifts the salary growth on the shoulders of buyers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart’s supporters note quite well that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any minor damage to corporations.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
A representative of the corporation, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that the jobs left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest action was "an entirely "another pirate trick" organized by the pro-liferator.
"Free cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York City, where their target was not Walmart universitaries (they don’t complain in this progressive city, and therefore they’re not here yet), and McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn’t even give you hospitals and doesn’t pay you for honest work!
Jumeirah Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 an hour.
Fast-food restaurants increase it over time, but little by little, and on average, their regular workers get in New York City $8.90 an hour.
There is no one in this expensive city who earns less.
How can you exist in New York for that kind of money, to me it's incomprehensible.
At one time, almost a quarter of the American teenagers who worked on their pencils after school passed through the McDonalds, while living with their parents.
Few people have seen the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now, I’m constantly pushing for an interview with McDonald’s workers, who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalds on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food eaters start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade union organizations in the field of fast food.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from doing so and punishing activists of the trade union movement with bribes and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But to cover fast food by the trade union is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the unusual flow of personnel.
Disagreement
Noise protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The climax of the action appeared in the middle of the day at a rally at McDonald’s next to the Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians performed, in particular, a member of the city council, Jumeirah Williams, who said: “Macdonald’s is not working for you,” and that he’s not selling you, and that’s why he’s selling it to you.
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Bill De Blasio, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who said that “we must be friendly in supporting fast-food workers in order for them to achieve fair pay and economic well-being.”
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest such action in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, while not all of them were employees of the fast-paced lobby, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will give rise to the flame of mass movement.
“As long as the brain cheats, it’s average.”
The popular theme of augmented reality among fans of modern technologies has recently been adopted mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft applied for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of a group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it follows that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are the stage that has passed.
They are manipulated by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general terms, what is your research group doing?
- We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in the mass is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes squeezing them with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is sold, because everyone is interested in gesture management.
- What else awaits us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information input has improved (the system gets more data) and the output is not very far.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, damn it, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s a popular thing, but don’t they overestimate it?
- It certainly cannot be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to inform others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about bulky ones, but about such expensive ones, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a hand bracelet, which fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
But in general, the future for a mixed type of control, for example, gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this gas bank?
You will say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what a car may or may not at the moment?
It’s not necessary, but it’s a mutual relationship.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow more accurate identification of human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of permission, depth, or something else?
In principle, the present generation is something that can be pushed back into our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 k/s.
But it is not in the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
Ultimately, all the current technologies are not good enough for us – this adds work to the designers of the algorithms.
That is, we must remember not only the permissions on axes X and Y, but also Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is frankly small, especially for gestures.
Steven Betisses of our Redmond Laboratory has made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern series sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
In my work, I would very much like the equivalent of such a device, only not requiring touch, so that the frames per second were larger.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a receiver of the reflected signal.
And now the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it harder by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curved position of the cameras and see how this will help in three-dimensional definition of the situation.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technology glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time walking, holding the smartphone in raised hands, is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "transition" augmented reality, when based on a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection.
Glasses are a very personal device, in this their strength (private things see only you), and at the same time weakness - an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Let’s imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to the simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: there is no tactile feedback!
My hands don’t feel anything!
What are your team’s responses to this challenge?
“In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh in terms of breakthroughs in human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a peculiar substrate for the image.
It's a great record of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" retouchability - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is, gives a feeling, but as long as it's very weak - as if it's under you.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he should feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task, which will have to be fought for a long time - how to force a person, physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on an open, almost endless - we are working on the concepts of running paths as well.
While cheating the brain is on average, work is still very much for many years to come.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher – many things in an absolutely primordial state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the St. Petersburg avant-garde project, dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top list has already caught the bright actors of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the legendary artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, who meets him at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then at fashion booths and fairgrounds.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always gather crowds of spectators wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance in the streets, causing a smile to the citizens, raising the mood of everyone.
He recently took the charm in his hands and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his divine existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around the city in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color as a modeler, engaged in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and society.
Although everything in society that is not a little gray, causes aggression and the instigation of bad property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasoline, which led to the Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, into clothes, into music, into all genres, except for words.
- And all this has come together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to feel at the center of St. Petersburg culture, where all the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995 I occupied the territory at Pushkinskaya 10, and there, until there was repair, there was a music-artistic club, a bohemian club, a house of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Shnura brought with the project "Ocho Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in a gripping trick, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programs until the Hali-Galilean times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and went his great career, and he got basic education and education from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboedov" is a vote from the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and always have gone.
I'm a hero of yesterday's century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, my culmination ended.
In the new times, working according to the old rules is uncomfortable, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable way of doing things.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have vividly expressed topicality and sharpness.
I'm going to have a show called The Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being like this is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything is smeared, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by means of a totalitarian rearrangement in order of order.
Now they meet on the clothes, focusing on the external mechanics, not on the internal man.
Maybe you can't give him a hand and you have to spit in the rose.
And deception will be removed with the help of disguise.
And recently, we saw you in the role of a city charmer, a cultural city must have such a hero.
Who, like me, they are.
Is it possible that commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be careful, tactical, sweet.
Disintegration of cultures is underway.
Previously, people had fallen into a room, the goddess loved one, the simple another.
Right now, everyone has broken up into micro-communities, now it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a cent-dollar piece of paper to please everyone.
Now you need to think about who you'll like.
Now, every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov's coming for a few thousand!
- He's wearing diapers, there's a sex-social sphere working.
And on cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and in the end less management, money, everything will disappear.
I have fans, the main thing is not to cheat them, not to spoil what is sewn.
When I was young, I wrote such paintings that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larion’s hangings.
I started with the pictures that usually end.
Concepts are often confused now.
They say: culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money for painting paintings.
I'm in favor of that culture.
- Kirill, what's the matter with St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can do culture.
With the right kings it was not so, the kings may not have understood very much in culture, but they understood that it is necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We in St. Petersburg have people who could be experts, but they are moved, as they need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
Now the taste buds are flourishing.
The same Erart, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are such artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is soil.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of interesting people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thin.
We need to make fashion art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented on the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Born in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with landers on board go in search of a reserve planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue your race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” said Vladimir Surdin, senior research fellow at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg (GAISH).
But if conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the questions of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
The four generations of the mountain grown in the orbit of the mountain were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - the removal in the orbit of insects, tiny fruit fly drosophile.
In 1979, scrambled eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
We get at the exit of a perfectly normal bird.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem is that this bird has to find resistance, it has to stand on its legs and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of RAN.
Unable to find the resistance, the birds whirled irregularly.
And after 10 hours, newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not react to light and sound.
And the trouble was that four days later they just died.
"And twice we peeled the birds, after that we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," - says Vladimir Sychev, the failure of the experiment with birds in space.
With animals, the last time a biological "minikcheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural found there.
“It was just on the biosatellites, but again it is a single experiment, and such research needs to be carried out,” notes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, a descendant of space rats appeared.
But to address the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing, the usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans, in principle, can do it.
Homo sapiens has an abstract thinking, and is able to create a similar emotional background.
On ethical grounds, such experiments are not carried out.
Women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was the land.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our Chaika flew, and no one on Earth could say whether it would survive after flying into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
“No one has answered this question,” said Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first female astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitzka, twice in orbit and even worked in open space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are units of cosmonauts, who after long flights have done everything, and a healthy generation is growing.
“And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights,” concludes the astronaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts develop the skills of working in open space.
The water imitates weightlessness.
If for adult water, let it be comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for breast children is a native feature.
Little ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother's womb fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the guide.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, instructor of breast-feeding.
In other words, if weightlessness is a more natural condition for the unborn child, then for a woman - gravity is necessary, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the muscles of the stomach, pelvis, the ability to push the fetus falls.
All right, let's put this down, relying on the family activity stimulants.
You can, of course, go to birth in a special camera, she will push it out.
"What next?" asks the non-trivial questions of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of earthly attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will ever need.
“And this experiment, which we will go to with you, by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to the Earth a disabled, completely unadapted person,” Igor Pestov, head of the IMBP RAS Bioethics Committee, predicts.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality when the earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet that will become home to their offspring born in space.
Chief of the Main Control and Audit Office: The verification of the welding system failed due to the fault of the politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of high-quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice President of the Supreme Audit and Control Board, from an interview for the website Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we are lacking," he said.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nechas’ approach to the so-called swartz system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - does this come out forbidden or allowed?
“The law should in any way be established, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of institutions that are subject to the obligation to verify and seek compliance with obligations,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on state procurement of both countries was compared.
What specifically was it about?
It is a parallel check that we started probably two years ago.
To put it simply, the fact that European legislation affirms how public procurement should be carried out is followed by national legislation and then by application in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with an uncompleted check, interesting differences have been found - to put it simply, the legislation may be "exact and error-free", but in practice, we are abandoning Germany by some parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you with what it means to you?
It is this kind of joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the order limit.
Perhaps this system will be filled with "books" so that those who wish to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the limit had not been lowered.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of state procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our KRU (Control and Audit Management) or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is based on our principle, there is also a college that works a little differently, but mainly both institutions operate in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of federal lands - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As far as local law is concerned, is it easier than we do?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is the best in everything.
Is it because they are better at controlling?
Certainly not, but I repeat, I don’t like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from co-operation with our office, would they?
If we talk about domestic legislation, then how did the amendment to the State Procurement Act affect your institution in some way the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet appeared in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we began to use our new tool "discovering the risk of non-economics", through which we pushed almost 14,000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will be manifested, because the conditions are not changing and the types of restrictions are changing.
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or add an additional burden to the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be “hardened” and will not be able to be complied with.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g., regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be enforced in such a way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called swartz system.
"Schwartz-System" banned or allowed?
The law should in any way be established, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of bodies that are subject to the obligation to verify and enforce obligations.
You can say, “We’re changing this law and we’re going to let it go,” but you can’t say that we’re going to pretend like nothing’s going on.
The law on public procurement contains quite strict rules as to how and what should be formally implemented, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
Roads in places are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They are mostly passable, but somewhere with greater caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in Karlovy Vary the roads were passable, but somewhere freezing and snowy.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it has to warm up a little.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, on the slopes of the Red Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that the places were less visible due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently passable without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be shallow and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain routes, are passable.
But in some of their sites still lie the remains of frozen and places of snow covered.
You need to be especially careful on the roads located on the heights.
Pardubice and Kralovegradec Region
The Czech Highways and Highways Administration on its website informs that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are at risk of snowfall, and on mountain roads and roads located on the heights may be covered with a layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about the famine, which can occur especially at the heights of the Pardubice region.
The gololede can be around Lanschkroon, Mouth-over-Orlitzi, Policki, Svitavi or High-Mito especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
The I/43 and I/34 roads, located in Svitava, are processed by chemicals.
Especially the snow lies on the roads of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlicki mountains.
The covered layer of snow is located on the roads, located on the highlands in the areas of Richnova-nad-Knezhnou and Trutnova.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today variable cloudiness without precipitation.
The temperature usually varies in the range of minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Plzen Region
Roads in Plze<0xC5><0x88> region are passable this morning, but places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
Drivers may face fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by the regional road workers.
The D5 road is now almost unrestricted, however, road managers recommend to exercise caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the roads of the first class have a dry and icy surface.
In the south of Plze<0xC5><0x88> and Takhov can be found the infested areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on underused roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the heights of the Olomouc region should take into account the snowfall on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Vistula Krsyzh.
At night, snowfall forced road workers to go outside, according to information from the management of roads, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperk.
In other areas of the road, we usually pass without restrictions.
"On the heights of the Schumperka lie the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Esenik should bear in mind the presence of a snowplow in the Chervenogorsk saddle,” – said today CHAN (Czech News Agency) the inspector of the traffic noise control.
At night, their colleagues from Esenik went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads at the heights after processing the chemicals remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads pass without restrictions, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful in the forest areas where humidity is still maintained.
Ustetskyi kraj, Libretskyi kraj
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are several difficult places left to pass.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow falling, a mountain road is closed on a site from Telnitsa in Klinitsa in Usteck Krai.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Republic, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
There have been no reports of complications on the roads.
Road workers report the appearance of a holocaust in the vicinity of Shteti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - the whole day was raining and melting snow, at night the sky became clear and freezing began.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on the main roads and on the I/13 route on the border of the Ustetsky and Libertsk regions.
Due to the sloping under the layer of snow, branches of trees relating to the road itself were forced to close the road in Telnitsa on Kninica.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think is the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are so easily caught up in.
“Together with The Tap Tap Group, we’re constantly joking about this topic and saying that we’re the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to slow down or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell me more about it to the readers?
This is a national fundraising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, at 21:00 on December 20, three concerts will start in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in parallel.
They will end, to put it bluntly, at the moment when the May calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with it together with our artist Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which this world will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time provide us with support.
The Tap Tap group, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world called "The End of the World Cancels".
Will the already beloved YouTube anthems sound to the listeners at these beneficent concerts?
Of course, in the end, if everything happens in the end and the end of the world does not come.
It is sung by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
At the same time, the anthems will also be played live on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video of Tomas Ganak, participates in the performance also Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also collaborate with other people in Czech cultural life, as we hold many charitable events and concerts.
We are actively trying to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert go towards the end of the world?
For the sixth year we have been working with the civil association Tap at the Edlicka Institute for the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO barrier-free educational center.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ki Institute schools and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity.
Within the framework of the project of additional construction of the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will emerge in the future, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to create a program that interests all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi.
All the details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “great events” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would be happy to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the US, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
From abroad you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle the road from the point of view of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and toolboxes.
However, as long as we managed this without any problems. Czech airlines <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me several times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to trips abroad you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with the disabled and so on.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that in the east it is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and there is still in the wild the independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, there is no such banal thing as giving way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly pursue the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance of which is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people to whom it relates.
In London and Madrid it is normal that people with a severe form of disability move independently on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common that a large number of people with limited opportunities take an active part in public life, in which we with The Tap Tap are a little ahead of them!
The respect of the public or the barrier-free is one thing, but at a time when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything will really start to change.
So far, these are unique cases – people with strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but let’s get back to two years ago, what in 1998 made you organize it?
I went to the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute as an educator, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and I play on the saxophone, together with my colleague I organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, as our leading lady Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Has popularity only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
That’s true, it helped us that we started joining famous singers and actively working on the propaganda group.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate is essentially as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the European Union’s resources, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Have you ever had the chance to get the Tap Tap so good?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in being able to do something extraordinary.
In the show business, it's full of things that mimic each other.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, regret, is natural.
But this sadness is completely unnecessary, because people with limited opportunities are not some kind of suffering and all the abandoned people that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I’m saying that if people with disabilities do something, it’s a shift not just for them, but for the whole of society.
Has success ensured that you are a strict leader, as many of you believe?
If we want to do the job qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that’s what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, twenty people are part of The Tap Tap group.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague at Incheba Stadium, Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynoj with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telecast at the time of the performance of The Tap Tap's song "The End of the World Is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise financial funds in the amount of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the educational center STUDEO at the Edlicka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 kroner, free entrance for children under 12 years. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and during the following years took an active part in a number of projects of the Agency.
But the journey to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
I will recall, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory the idea of his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltra and Andre Luis Hirsch Prize for "Introduction to Spacecraft".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great proponent of astronomy and cosmonauts.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned cosmonautist, and his contribution was appreciated including that one of the craters on the opposite side of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway crane was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as did the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a rocket had to be used to disengage or to brake the truck.
Information about this tree is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about rocket fires.
The study was carried out by the Arms Engineering Section in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzhitsky.
From the preserved materials it can be seen that the studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric launcher rocket, which was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in a specialized press, and the following year came out the work "Air torpedo rocket and aerial bomb" by author Lelyva-Kzhivoblotsky.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Prior to the war, all projects of military use of missile equipment were undertaken by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymchasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended due to the start of the war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautych).
For the first time, the society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal "Problems", which publishes four volume articles on astronomy.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would engage in cosmonautism.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn of the POA has become its real member.
And the following year, the first president of the International Astronautics Federation Kazimez Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the vice president of the International Astronautics Federation.
He remained in this position until his own death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of exceeding a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were carried out on the Bled Desert.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high winds.
But in 1962, further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types (labelled as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1V - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight distance of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to lift a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Cosmic Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The resolution has sparked a lively debate in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital along with unencumbered financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) there is a price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the state of affairs when the manufacturer, by means of the delivery of cheap goods, tries to stand in economic competition by "slowing" the value of the competitor in order to take away a large part of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable costs of the state for social needs are increasing.
In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of employers to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social and social damage they inflict in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create a situation at the level of the economies of individual States when the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population at random to private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected, first and foremost, in the changes in current legislation.
The aim is to economically force its people to submit to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor for several years, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labour.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases when hard-working people receive such wages that the state must pay them to get a living minimum.
Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
The economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to invest in a landfill.
However, he wonders where it will come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for the share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and mass media to the brim claim that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which the controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists strongly that the state should not interfere with the economy by its governing actions.
Next, we must answer the question whether private capital, now practically controlling politics and the state as a whole, does not operate for its own selfish purposes?
The clear answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of almost all-powerful and omnipresent lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a fruitless situation manifested in corruption, providing mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but it is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is that, due to the lack of financial resources, the state ministries entrust the development of bills to private law firms, which are closely related to industry.
Then these bills are passed by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from the financial-power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly in a situation as described by Appian in the book “Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii”: “The State has long been falling apart, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Betrayal, illegal receipt of graces with the help of stones and swords.
The octopus and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and the people would have gone to the elections with a pre-sold voice....the ordinary people did not run for the position of ruler, at the end of one day the state for eight months remained without a consul..
As in ancient times, in modern society, selfless interests prevail without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer intended to be used for public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper character.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes is that we must look for the reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-type democracy can be seen as a definite break, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision, or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is of a systemic nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's shareholding in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the government and weaken the monopolistic position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out” – Sting, the song “The fragile”, where the main verse of the refrain is the words: “we do not forget how fragile we are”.
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Guttel Schnapper, the wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, caused a lot of reactions.
Some argue for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, and the Palestinians are acting as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arab states, the Arab states.
I don’t want to think about who in these periodically recurring waves of murder is a criminal, but who is the victim, after all, today’s citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who is first served by the 95-year-old tension (calculated from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of the Middle East land.
Some of my arguments are backed up by historical facts, some of them based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is, above all, the history of the struggle for power.
In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps on their own, or whether someone was behind their throne who directed their actions toward the goals set out in advance.
It should be admitted that we are living in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have happened in the lifetime of one generation.
Among astronomically rich families there is one that could be considered the head of the spruta (I don’t know if someone is standing above them, but that’s not excluded) – the Rothschilds.
They don't write much about them.
Yes, of course.
The first news agency (Reiters) they bought back in the 1990s to stop rumors linking their name to criminal acts in the higher realms in which they were in the shadows, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the proliferation of wealth and friendship.
They have large packages of shares in almost all of the world’s central banks, and against countries whose central banks they do not have their share, they are waging or preparing for war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries). After the invasion of Iraq, the bank became only 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Kafir
Anyone who tried to resist this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the Civil War he began to issue his own (at least government) money and was killed in 1865 in a theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed (federal reserve system), was killed in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars created by the great masonic of the 33rd level by Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was to destroy monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination of the country, especially Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (the number of slaves would not be enough to secure them).
The method used by a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds is a challenge to the crisis and a subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED’s foundation, which was supposed to prevent the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, beginning the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly, unwarranted in military and economic terms by German surrender (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the breakup of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a strong conflict situation with Chelyabinsk, imposed huge military reparations on Germany, which created the precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it was only left to give the Germans a strong and suffocating form.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration has created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population have begun.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or whatever he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create the scene of a third war.
If the international bankers manage to unravel it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (take only a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment creates resentment in the endless chain of violence, if everything began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers bribe people to vote in elections only for their own candidates.
the current Prime Minister of Israel Yastreb Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to all of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan), will be a crossover ...
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order.”
The new world order in their representation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
“And he compels all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on his right hand or on his forehead a stamp, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the number of his name could not buy or sell.
This is what wisdom is: anyone who has the mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.
The film "Operation Argo": When the worst is nowhere, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic student protesters seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who fled after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected – it could not afford to throw a chessboard because it could fundamentally undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was unable.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Detained diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations with the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult peripheries, they ended their journey to the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, while helping an extravagant cover legend, according to which they went through Canadian passports as members of the shooting team, searching for a place in the country to shoot a science fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by “evacuation” expert Tony Mendes, demanded Hollywood’s cooperation.
In order for the legend to be reliable, the specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, arranged a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-kinoup", the story of a successful snooze, an affair - an example can be a number of films about Oushen's friends.
The moods in the film are constantly changing – on the one hand, the documentary-designed scenes from Tehran (in the titles are shown marked historical photos of events and the way the same situations were shown in the film – there are no major differences in this).
On the other hand, the relief of Hollywood fragments intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then more scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation behind the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, by phone ...
Ben Affleck had a great start to his career.
From the ridiculed actor he became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after the dark detective "Hello, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film, which is not filmed in the native city of the director - Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place at the same time refers to the qualities that elevated the director’s earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in "Argo", where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the opening scenes of the embassy fall impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere suddenly history changes.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in the fictional scenes (the subordinate headquarters at the Tehran Bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
It works quite successfully with this few, sometimes something comes up - there all this does not come out so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the looming crisis at the airport of Tehran, and a drive on the runway).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is the dispersion associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood co-stars are really very amusing, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of dramatism, it is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the setting and retro style that recreates the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to catch.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in the known sense of living history, as well as to testify to the exaggerated perceptions of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services.
Rules of inflatable balloons, bananas and circuses
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop”.
“We were encouraged by this last event, in which the EU plans to accept a 40% quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, organizer of the survey.
Among those already nominated for absurdity is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can put up for competition by the end of this year.
The vote alone will take place until the end of February 2013," Nager said.
For example, the EU requires the addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in damage to nature, as well as the ban on the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances in the fuel, or in the fuel stream.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "butterbore oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of some trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under threat of veto defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and did not dare to exhibit an "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission justified the fact that it only harmonises existing divergent national rules that have complicated trade.
Despite the resistance of some countries, the EU has nevertheless softened the standards on fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that existing directives will lead to the spillover of products.
The candidate for the poll may also become a more recent EU ruling, according to which air balloons selling must be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to American research, according to which air balloons during the game are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are prohibited from entering the fair duchess.
Fun ideas are born at home.
It is quite absurd and the rule concerning the European officials themselves: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicateness of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, and should instead speak "BURM" (Yugoslav Republic).
Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The Principle of Non-interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to a few of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks that can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The survey organisers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the lack of sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on a grant application.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are in a bad situation because we don’t have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation”, – said the then Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CSDP) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stockpiles of stocks that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy was offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to the drawing up of a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Strange Orders are an Exception
Although decisions in Member States are easily the subject of criticism, the EU’s efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, many experts believe, deserve recognition rather than recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU grants for projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It evokes emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomoutskii syrki", but "Tuzemski rom", the tradition of which in our country goes back to the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed "Tuzemak".
The rum can only be called products of cane distillate, not of sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, together with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgondzola", marzipan from the German Lubeck or the Parmian Vecchia, have already been found, for example, Karlovy Vary, Porzhelytsky and Trzebonsky Karp and
Also, the EU brand can be proud of the Pardubice steamer and the Gorzhitsa pipes.
“People want me to protect the republic, but I’m an amateur,” Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how does a man get to run for president?
I don’t want to be a senator or a president.
If everything had worked without problems in our country, I would not have run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country unfold over the last 20 years, how thieves get used to it, people raise taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I’m already 40 years old and I’m an independent person who doesn’t belong to any party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential palace.
Do you not turn your back on the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I will join the struggle for the presidential palace depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I am elected as a senator, I will run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation are robbing ourselves in a bar or a TV, but at the same time are ready to crush anyone who tries to change something.
To this is added the media, which distort the person, and which confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irji Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
The struggle for the presidential palace you started with the thesis about the material and criminal liability of politicians and about return property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You, as president, do not have such powers, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied to make tours a free enterprise, it was able to move forward.
The problem is in politics – when someone comes up with a good offer to the left or right, they intentionally make obstacles to it, and it deters citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without party deployment on the shelves, without looking at the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more like the left.
It doesn’t matter to me at all – a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It’s not that someone is on the right, but someone on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it is proposed by the CPM or the GDP, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or they’re being talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only have slogans left.
In politics, you won’t last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side so that we can achieve ours.
Had I been elected president, it would not have been a problem to organize a direct television broadcast in which I would address the presidents of parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong person who will voice abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was a merit of pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to move things on my own; in case that doesn't work, six years from now, I'll be back in the private sector.
In part, it sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I passed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, he refused due to the large volume of work.
Also, I at least supported the lead investigation by journalist Jan Lorentz, who uncovered fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really unsatisfied, but now I feel like I’m on weight.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that the changes would be difficult.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the purity of every potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money for that.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroner.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about property declarations, and how are your own dealings with it?
Personal property is estimated to be about 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and another
By the way, Aston Martin came to me because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against greed and lawlessness.
You're going to Aston Martin, you own a fortune of 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have a sponsor shows that my program isn’t that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn’t live on that money, for example, I couldn’t pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So, then, you're going to do entrepreneurship so you can live?
Did you not say that you would reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the amount of salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a silversmith who will keep the republic.
But I need to live for something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, do you get used to getting monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, what I get and beyond.
If I were president, I would have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday issue of the newspaper "Right".
The architects of the MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speykenisse and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“I think this building looks fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lizette Verhaig, walking down the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in the vicinity of a large enterprise, thinks so: “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I ask myself: why do we have another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's voluntarily going to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Spiekenisse, a rare sleeping town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this embarrassing circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of painted miniatures made of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had only one chance to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Viny Maas from the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, master of bold column diagrams and author of sharp, sometimes even cynical buildings, referred to the task with his usual impudence and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with a sledgehammer on five books under.
And while the members of the jury looked puzzledly and shook their shoulders, the bold Maas put out his original pyramid-sized gift and finished the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
There it is, my suggestion: "Book Mountain" in Spiekenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential homes and townhouses totaling 50 apartments.
In early November, the "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012" competition.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Wood Construction Competition.
Thus, the impersonal suburb, which had never been able to offer anything other than the postmodernist pedestrian zone and the surprisingly unbelievably beautiful town hall, whose white facades suggest the idea of a dairy factory, became richer on one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly - in Spaekenisse appeared the first in the history of this town a public building of cultural purpose.
A long way to the book
First impression: Eldorado's book under the lid for cheese.
There is only one lift in the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glazed room on all sides - light and easy to see, the floors of the burned brick and elegant street lights create a sense of public city square flawlessly.
The city environment is perfectly recreated.
The look is involuntarily looking for camels, dogs and playing football for boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
“Usually bookshelves stand along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space from the feet to the head and pulled out the reading zone from the inside out.
The internal space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center there are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and technical premises.
Especially happy are black bookshelves, which serve as the decoration of walls, parapets, and stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and construction engineers are lost in guesswork, which is for the unknown material.
“We wanted to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Speikenisse community, according to the requirements of the standard.
And once at a farm in Frisland, we found a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been used as a substrate under the root.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textile serves one or two seasons, after which it can be discarded.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed in a panel with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplasty (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little crossover.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Those who overcome the path of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figurines in the pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass canopy, even on clear days the sun falls inside only for a short time.
The wide farms of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned sceptic in the field of IT, has already visited the new library.
Lizette Verhaig has also been here.
And also a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Spakenisse, which has long been lacking."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own collection.
These books were to occupy empty spaces on the shelves of a not yet fully equipped library - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The poles are set to the top.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vini Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident is somehow connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on a professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spaekenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for identity building.
Sabo: "Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefan Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
- Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, while not speaking too critically about Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
As a result, NATO has made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, it is moving from a policy, which, so to speak, was governed by the United States, to German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent unified policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that for the time being they are only finding their role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy pursued by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is the willingness to take a position in their national interests, independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are vastly different from those of other major states, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it needs to be cautious so as not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States there is a predominant understanding of the German position.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even acquire a certain amount of respect in this way.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, spoke clearly for the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration, deep down, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that the significant differences in opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would have been a little easier if there were a single, uncontroversial European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot act within a broader approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of relations with Israel.
This topic has always been succinct.
But I think the Germans are clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player – won’t it really take on the main role?
Or is the leading role still hard to give to Germany?
Germany has not yet gotten used to this, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German sentiments are manifested.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
In fact, it’s an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should take into account a wide range of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
So, the influence of the US in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don’t like it, it’s unpleasant or it increases your dislike – that’s life!
Stephen Sabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., an institute in which academics and political experts from Europe and North America jointly investigate the problems of the transatlantic community.
In addition, Sabo is a member of the German Marshall Fund, in which he specializes in German politics, U.S. foreign policy and transatlantic ties.
"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
It is a fully officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
It is still unclear if they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloh, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a company specializing in trademark infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new case of this kind appears on my table.
It is enough for the issuers to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trade marks.
Thus from Gucci it is obtained Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada it is possible to register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies are legally copied, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloh opens a folder with records from the Beijing Trademark Registration Office.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name in which the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna was also used.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are multi-storey dormitories that sell almost exclusively fakes.
However, Pattloha's cases are not the same. On the orders of his creditors, he opposes that Chinese enterprises have officially received from the Trademark Registration Office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai", a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban dakuan".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese government does not accept the blame.
“It hurts the business, we have to fight it,” Pattloh said.
“The brand washes away, the unique situation is lost, the image suffers very much.”
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of dubious records in the trade mark register, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuit, since after a long time the disputed name became a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plaintiff, as he has damaged his trademark in China, Pattloh says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, an enterprise that had recently acquired the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to that of a Mercedes star.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to staff shortages and equipment of premises there.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency in the working process to the norm.”
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases on objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, up 75 per cent from last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still awaiting production in the department.
Fighting this is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row China has headed the list of new registrations around the world.
The same applies to the total number of real trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To put it simply, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To protest it is worth many times more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans managed to achieve that the illegal production of their fake car parts was eliminated.
However, the impersonator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an omission of its own, as names in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Ventsler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Board in Munich.
And the Ministry of Registration of Trade Marks CTMO rejected the claim of the Munichers.
True, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues the fight to this day.
You have to be watching.
The issue is currently under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Ventsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs are hardly taken into account, the company’s archive had to look at even the acts of a century ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg inadvertently offered the opposing party a "big six-figure sum in euros" for settlement.
“It’s clear from here how expensive this is for us,” says Ventsler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to move even to Europe.
That is, if the imitators register behind them unprotected trade marks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The company has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this, it was able to prevent registration.
“You have to wait,” says Ventsler.
Both he and Pattloh’s lawyer recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should "everything that in any way is worth protecting, to register also in China," - says Ventsler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party licensing fees for his own name, explains Ventsler.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: to drown, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg, the choir repeats the Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans enjoy it.
The history of relations that have overcome the distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
At first, a flood is unleashed: cowboy boots, basketball crossovers, women's boats and men's caps pick up the tat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
It is only after that that the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they attack, charm and follow each other.
And Fyte Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, barely jumps out of his maternity shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, choir Imbongi repeats a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age came to the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to the palace.
"Om" Obani is a difficult thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, in addition to in a completely foreign language: the Zulu language, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Sva.
Help for Self-Help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are around 34 million people living with HIV in the world.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Essitzen, Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that is preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a boss.
It guarantees the child money for school, school form and daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongs in the Zulu language mean storyteller or admirer.
In this room, they don't say run to the bantu, but they know how to sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been teaching songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even bringing them back to where they first appeared: in South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Essitzheni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected 40 percent
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the HIV virus.
In Essitjen, the miniaturized disease of all Swaziland is reflected: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Cutting of the extremities in men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, among the population is almost not accepted.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland’s population carries the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
Choir opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, Imbogni’s participants had seen many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants – for several euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which since then has almost professionally taken care of AIDS orphans in Essitzhen.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important diseases that are transmitted sexually?
Bacterial IPPs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Lobular pedicure and brushing refer to parasitic IPP.
What are the main impact groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are transmitted as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, frequent sexually transmitted diseases include chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low – however, about 20 percent of new HIV infections belong to this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are significantly more common than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also often have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms of venereal disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers in the genital area may occur, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as blisters or constipation.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can I protect myself?
Condoms are able to reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular examination, especially with frequent changes of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most STIs and avoid distant consequences.
The boss, the donations and last but not least, the fees for people’s speeches throughout Germany allow something to be collected.
“We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Essitzhen,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, there is money from Germany, Chodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well arranged, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they are called in the Zulu language of old women, is the stronghold of the village.
Some of them have adopted up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that children in shape every day appear in class on time.
Those who do not have any relatives come to the shelter of Hanisil, the only woman to receive a salary from the association, as well as two funerals that prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the "Voices for Africa" association organized a sewing school, built two chickens and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized an HIV analysis for many residents of the village.
It is difficult to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, they prefer to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s linked to sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a sanctioned state of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent years.
But it also lies on the wandering workers who spread the virus across the country.
There are free condoms literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re hardly used.
“Another culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support a bit of cultural exchange, Choir Immogni makes a trip to South Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, happened, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always takes you to Essitzhen, where the singers visit the underage children.
Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the valley of the river Eculveni it is more than known.
“Go to Essie, there’s light,” the people here say.
And after an 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when hot singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here too.
NASA Launches Ice on Mercury <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Messenger probe found evidence that Mercury has ice on the planet.
The ice cover can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that the ever-present region of the planet is covered in ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said probe scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life got into other parts of the solar system.
Inconspicuously for the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small eyelets into endless giveaways.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres, according to a 2006 new definition of the International Astronomical Union, is not a “planet.”
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink "reborn" stars in the stellar circle.
This region of star formation - scientists unromanticly call it W5 - is discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This flickering heat of the dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
A ring-like dot consists of a material that the star ejected in the process of dying.
In the gigantic nebulae, a new star emerges from gas and dust, 5,400 light-years away from Earth.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic delivery room.
The star cluster of Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, with a color telescope, they get better.
As the red eye softens the observer the obscurity of Ulitka in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
The similarity to the Earth's continent brought this nebula to the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infra-red photography provides an expressive color transmission.
This new star in all its beauty managed to be photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the "Spitzer" telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they originated is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are fragments of the moon Saturn, which disappeared inextricably 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: the Aquarius galaxy
Depending on the color transmission, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the distant trifid nebula in the constellation of Strelitz for several thousand light years.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-dimensional, three-part), as dark strips of dust divide into three parts of the split heart of the constellation.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers photographed the precursor of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from the Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies carry each other and inevitably collide.
This is the birth of the star Hubble telescope shot in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn’t like technical cuts can call it the “Southern Pipe Wheel.”
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1400 light-years away, consists of dust particles, the size of which is ten to a hundred times smaller than that of ordinary home dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
A large spiral galaxy is known as the UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cluster is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the nebula of the Rosetta, also constantly creates new stars – 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgem - even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and their available view of space is getting deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., a "Big Binocular Telescope" is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of one mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Greater South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - to reduce the cost.
However, in diameter, it reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of low-cost constructive performance: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-gathering capacity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the "Very large telescope" - completely corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow you to illuminate even the average infrared spectrum in the viewing tube.
In the Chilean observatory, ESO is also planning to install a European “Very Large Telescope”.
Its main mirror should be spread out to a total of 42 meters - and will be made up of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks into the sky using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope with a diameter of thirty meters should appear on Mauna-Kea.
Here you can fall in love with the illustrations.
However, the most important types of space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system – above all those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photo depicts the latest preparations of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Aryan 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope’s tasks: it must search for the Big Bang in the world of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists believe that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger rotates closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over decades have indicated that Mercury has ice on it.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to rotate around Mercury, scientists are now convinced of this.
Drink oil every day - and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a more biblically respectable age.
There is even a museum of longevity here.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a more biblically respectable age.
There is even a museum of longevity here.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
A trip through the Tali<0xC5><0xA1> Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A minibus with a boom is rolling down the winding road past thick forests of hills, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around you is so green and bright that you can think like you are in Schwarzwald.
But it is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers away.
The Talishi live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, of which little is known, except that they speak beautifully in Farsi and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Lerick.
The small town is steeped in the over-heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not at all harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too boring.
At 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth, to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, until it is reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerike.
"In May Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the biography of about eight dozen squids from these places, which is more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirali Muslyumov, who is reportedly 168 years old.
Evidence of birth, however, is not.
And given that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, is 122 years old, the age of Muslyumov seems extremely doubtful.
“He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,” Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
Is this how the Muslim boy added a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of long-term caregivers in Central Asia.
“A very large number of elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, since there were no registers of civil status.
Every day a glass of warm oil
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerika area surprisingly often reach Bible age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old.
Why are there so many long-term residents here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with special stem genes.
The director of the museum Fatulaev, on the contrary, believes that the matter is in nutrition.
Taurus loves meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of warm oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a matter of a primitive way of life that keeps people young? In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she's running tirelessly through.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughters, who have long had their grandchildren.
There are also two children jumping nearby.
In the kitchen guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical puffy glasses of armoud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under the headboard she hides long dark-brown hairs, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair in milk, so they never fell and kept the color.
“And I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzaeva says.
A monthly pension is enough for life.
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, pears.
I’ve never bought products in a store my whole life.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after the Second World War.
But it got better when Heydar Aliyev’s “beloved father” got in the way.
Propaganda doesn’t often sound like an old woman’s speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, and then once the government adopted his son Ilham.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elders.
230 manats (about the same amount as the euro) Mirzayev receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is an amount on which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva’s long grown son is also right: “The elders in our culture enjoy deep respect.”
They live in a large family, loved, cared for, and happy.
There is no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human right” is absent in the Constitution.
The revolution is back in Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of the country’s deep split.
The future constitution, based on Sharia law, met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not buy into the papacy.
We have to make a transition.
“And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but first of all to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, so far hopelessly divided in a lost opposition, are experiencing fear.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful "Muslim Brotherhood".
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily cut off the constitutional court’s jurisdiction and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution.”
However, what he actually wants to save is a 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were leaked in a nightly 15-hour jump with obstacles to an Islamist-minded 100-member constitutional assembly, and this is partly a cause for concern.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft says that court proceedings are based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does “principles” mean?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that Islamists will use the floating wording and the resulting legal luft for a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
At least one new article hints at this: in all cases relating to Sharia law, the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution, should be attracted to the council, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but it could mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, that de facto would result in a limitation of judicial power.
There is a lot of interpretation in the draft constitution.
Another problem: the susceptibility of civilians to the military court must be maintained.
These courts during Mubarak's rule served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, there were up to 11,000 civilians in the military prison.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect the “true essence of the Egyptian family” and “support its morality and values.”
Legally, this has been formulated so vaguely that state institutions will be able to control even the content of film and literature with the help of this article.
With open text, it means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article establishes a direct equality between men and women.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Prophet (peace be upon him).
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
There is also a wording that “insulting people” is forbidden.
Will there be enough cartoons for the president or jokes about the lawyer?
The issue of interpretation, as well as much in this project, which Morsi is proposing to sign and which he says will be presented to the Egyptians in a referendum "very soon."
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks now, the opposition has been formed against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unity on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document even before it could come into force.
“The revolution is back, and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution had a place “in the dump of history”.
Through Twitter’s short news service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead the “putch against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him away," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The well-organized "Muslim Brotherhood", in turn, called for an opposite demonstration, but, out of caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and supporters of the Salafis, who shouted: “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Morsi: “Cleanse the land!” and assured him: “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
The majority of the Islamists believe this is a settled matter.
“The concept of ‘human right’ is never mentioned.”
Hafiz Abu Saeed is outraged by this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, had to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ECHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or in Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
And now the words “human rights” are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with “Welt am Sonntag”.
The expansion of Morsi’s influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the president de facto canceled it,” Saeed regrets.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a payment for this.
A protester on Tahrir Square warns: “You’re creating a monster you can’t control.”
Norway's Raccoon: The World's Worst Smell Fish?
Norway’s population of five million is one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but also in the whole world.
Perhaps the secret of this country’s success is somehow connected with a local passion for one extremely evil fish dish?
Take a few chewed pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a shimmering smell of raspberries - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours' drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered picturesque species. It is very beautiful, but in the air there is an inexhaustible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a broth soaked with salt and soaked in water for up to a year, depending on what the soul needs to achieve.
As the swamps thicken and cool, crowds of Norwegians gather for the festival in Fagernes, dedicated to the same, let’s say, exciting dish.
“It’s eaten raw and drunk with rum of aquavit, local tin vodka,” explains Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and co-founder of the “Racfis General”, who heads the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes of fish and drink it in large portions of the alcoholic beverage.
“Somebody likes aquavit more than raccoons,” says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - little is different from the portion of land that you have been driving with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the appearance of refrigerators, fish in the fall were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly weaned, it was extracted and, by suppressing the perception of alcohol, consumed in food.
In memory of the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, which include jobs, high wages and an advanced social security system.
The inhabitants of Sweden (a longtime rival, and not so long ago, a much more livable neighbor) come here to work massively.
Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, an indisputable, though somewhat malicious element of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the country’s residents seem to settle for it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Not to mention his name, the attack is called "July 22".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their compatriots was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway’s current well-being is based on the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, who is carrying a long-sustained racquet, a woman with long light hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks wonderfully in English.
We don't like to show off, we're not proud.
Norway is very cautious about its oil – most of the oil and gas industry’s revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was wasting money they didn’t have, Norway carefully accounted for all the costs.
“As long as you can go skiing in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's a raccoon," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in a row for some food - a racket is enough for me.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat - it's exactly exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special dinner dedicated to raccoons, during which visitors determine by voting the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There's a live TV set that shows the leader in the sidewalk, surrounded by plates with raccoons.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what's your assessment of the best fish out there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls out of a chair, maybe by taking over the aquavit.
Or maybe just the smell of that fish.
Mexico’s President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto is about to start his career.
As Mexico’s newly elected president Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
The road traffic in Mexico is now in a particularly teary state.
The city was overloaded with transport and at a better time, and since Monday, steel fences have been erected, cutting off several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not in order to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the parliament building.
On Sunday, Mexico's new head Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will wear a presidential tie and take the reins of the country's government.
There is a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic indicators under the administration of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who is now in power, but the country has lost its way in the war on drugs, which has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House’s Oval Office earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, alongside the President of the United States, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s political career developed as the governor of his native state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the country’s capital, opinions about the new leader were shared.
Straight-line man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents put it to the benefit of revitalization of tourism, development of the resort sphere and creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached on one of the new roads built by Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which differ markedly from the roads with bumps and pits that were previously on this site.
The tables with its name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are connecting with him the hopes for real and serious change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Oliver Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, a state congressman from the head of the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, first and foremost in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was expelled in 2000 by Visente Fox.
Congressman Olivera admits that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
In addition, he denies the allegations of insubordination, which the new president has put forward to the opposition.
He is very direct and very devoted to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent public figure, and, above all, a man who is able to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkoyotl, also known as Ciudad Ness, is the most striking contrast with the mighty streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the estacades of motorways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality also bear the harsh character of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were drawn to appease drug-trafficking gangs in these areas, and violence against women is particularly acute here.
Several dozen bodies of women killed were found in the desert near a large dump in the last two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State during the governorship of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which is significantly higher than that in the notorious city of Ciudad Huarez, whose name has become na<0xC3><0xAF>ve when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, it can be said at best that during his tenure as governor, he was unable to cope with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case scenario, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this besieged area, Irina Buendia hardly restrains tears by showing me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her accomplice.
“When I got to her house, it was as if her body had been washed before that,” Mrs. Bundy recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and her body was already spinning.
Mariana’s mother tells this story, and her daughter’s portrait looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
This, they say, is what the family refused to do.
“The state officials treated me like an old gossiper, an unsatisfying peacemaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and to shrink.
But that’s not right, it’s not possible, especially when there are so many violations and misunderstandings around,” she says.
Wearing a presidential tie on Saturday, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, along with her, will take on an uneasy responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new president has promised to make addressing this issue a priority during his administration.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was the governor,” says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecution says.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's statements about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that serial Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint for ill-treatment, which, according to him, he had to go to war.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Feyn said that the records of Manning's weekly visits by representatives of the prison administration during his nine-month detention in Kwantiko, Utah.
A cross-examination as part of the consideration of Manning’s defence application on the grounds that his detention was violent and in itself sufficient punishment was carried out the day after Manning stated that he was in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of the information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Feyn, together with Manning, reviewed reports that were filled out after Manning's visits by representatives of the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the prison administration’s appeal to him as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized.”
The reports under consideration do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of its content, Feyn claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about these problems and that the representatives of the administration who attended him discussed these problems with him and stated that they would deal with them, but did not record it in writing.
“They recorded ‘no problems’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t raise the issue in the conversation,” Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain of an irregular treatment with him in January 2011 during a commission meeting that examined the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing in a matter of months.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to achieve a “traumatic prevention” regime and soften the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the restricted detention regime - at a level lower than the supervisory regime in order to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay with them canceling the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of living improves, from my point of view," Manning said.
On Thursday, Manning testified of his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that thoughts of suicide appeared in him in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to a strong heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not told how your participation is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has reached the Camp Arifjan base, the size of my prison," Manning said Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in this cell.”
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small camera - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, slippers, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, as sleeping or even just lying down during the day prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he constantly had light in his eyes, penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he was turning into a bed at night, then, according to him, he was awakened and forced to turn his back.
Manning's lawyer filed an official objection to the illegal treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning for a statement he made while giving evidence on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning said he had not been able to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to the judge’s questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the guard’s order that he should drop a blanket that could be covered, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to drop it.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a rubber band of cowards or sleds to traumatize himself, but he didn’t.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he has had to live through during the incarceration, and will significantly shorten the time of the incarceration if Manning is found guilty by the military court, which is due to begin consideration of his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge him as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of detainees under the strictest possible regime.
Among the charges brought against Manning include assisting the enemy, illegal promotion of the publication of data on the Internet, transmission of information relating to national defense, and theft of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all points of the indictment, he may face a life sentence.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the country’s residents of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that Mexicans of American origin split between the two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico, I walked down the arrival corridor, approached the border control zone, and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), and the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a Mexican my whole life.
It’s just a conditional name, like what my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York consider themselves Italians.
Later I stopped at the complex construction of "American of Mexican descent".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of the speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
That’s why I got my American passport and became the order for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the questions used to meet the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, which will allow Mexicans now, with the same success, to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the U.S. and Canada and create some North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto has promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals have been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a difficult and old-fashioned issue.
The majority of Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and, under the duress of guns, forced its leaders to abandon half their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only for any U.S. government official to speak out at least with the word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elites of Mexican society immediately complain that the Americans are reaching for the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montesuma are overrun with militancy.
At the same time, Mexico’s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States is the most difficult.
You want to talk about abuse?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country for themselves, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone—father or grandfather—had no chance of making a living in Mexico and was forced to leave.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - striped, under-trained, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we have studied in good schools and have done good work, but we must not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider its own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as non-real Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our relations with Mexico aren’t strong enough.
Only our existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not now be behind the silk curtain, finding a living life in the United States, but having lost spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the U.S. as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and this American.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican descent do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
By getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations were not yet sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and representatives of the intelligence community want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Americans of Mexican descent to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too many attempts in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the rise of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, Amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent are still offended by how recently the Mexicans have treated them.
Yeah, yeah.
I guess we have more in common than I thought.
The Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could become a fragile foundation for a future world.
Is it possible for a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed is pushing for the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
It sounds like the usual, meaningless arguments about who started the first; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians have been killed, most of them civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, Israelis have been released from exile from the territory.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians have been hopelessly tied up in their eternal conflict, there have been changes in the Middle East.
This can be treated in different ways, but the events of the "Arab Spring" have surrounded in the rebel storm a lot of established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis have failed to stay away from the storm that shook the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope to get out of this deadly deadlock.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes this week have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, say they have forced Israel to step down despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group’s leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million residents have been blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic parts of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River – another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, new influential and wealthy friends emerge in Hamas.
Turkey, a regenerating regional leader who was once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas’s pro-democracy supporters declare the creation of an Islamic crescent around Israel – from Lebanon to the north, which is dominated by the Hezbollah militant group, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are now overthrowing the power of Bashar Assad, Daesh, and Daesh.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Brotherhood-Muslim movement under President Mohammed Morsi was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay special attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslim brothers, on the other hand, are an organization, much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In the future, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli anti-missile system "Iron Dome" justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the launched Hamas missiles.
Israelis can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained true to its unchanging position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, particularly with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the territory of the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of terrorists-killers, in part because of the wall that enters the territory of the West Bank from the Jordan River, and is not a significant part of the country.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the elections scheduled for 22 January - has united with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman, is very convenient.
What’s the point of slaughtering the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they put all the power in their hands on the West Bank, won’t they start launching rockets from there towards Israel, as their counterparts in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the "hard" line will win; however, their calculations may be rejected by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not experiencing the warmest feelings towards Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defense portion of Israel’s budget is larger than that of all its Arab neighbors, taken together.
Deploying a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of Egypt’s president, Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on ending the fire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to a minimum, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As the democratic changes in the Arab countries take place, the Palestinian deprivation of the right to self-determination is a bomb of slow action, which sooner or later will explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, similar to the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect – the growth of the Arab population – only exacerbates these problems.
Blood transfusions, which are carried out every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, have to pay for the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides are in need of an external impulse.
There is only one solution that is constantly called upon by health-minded representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and the surrender of territories by Israel in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, - the hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the sides of the conflict.
Egypt, which has long since decided to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have, as never before, been in a favourable position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote at the UN, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
His role in putting Israel at the negotiating table should also be played by President Obama.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate the unwillingness to connect to the solution of the problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Unified Cigarette Packaging Act came into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the image of the affected parts of the body are contrasted on the shaded green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first Australian law on the same-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and coloring of different brands with the same box of mono-olive color with jagged pictures of the disease affected parts of the body and limbs.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages introduced in the mandatory order from this Saturday is the names of the stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia states that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion status.
The basis of this decision was the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking until age 26, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
“It’s obvious that even at a young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to bring with the help of packaging,” Health Minister Tanya Plibersek explains, referring to studies that showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with deuces.
Australia is one of the world’s smallest smokers, so these changes will not have much impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will sell cheap and affordable cigarettes.
“This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those devised by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for napkins and silicone napkins, hiding unpleasant pictures on the packaging, has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago such companies as Philip American Tobricco, Philip American Tobricco
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesale companies and is expecting a new party.
This is a good business for us.
A potential impediment to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among precisely the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that made illegal television advertising a cigarette and support them for sporting activities, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing ads on the network, but it cannot limit foreign sites to that.
“If you’re trading tobacco products and you’re left with just this little lasagna, the idea of promoting your product on the Internet will seem extremely tempting to you,” says Becky Freeman, a research scientist at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews on brands written by supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises – is it really a matter of the hands of a ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he did not regret the strength and time and made a video, or is it worth the advertising company?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry even went to measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, stating that the trade will not be subject to unfair restrictions, not to all restrictions.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photographs to warn of the harm of smoking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstrably not following the innovations.
These pictures don’t bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
“You just pull out a cigarette and hide a packet in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a photo of a mouth tumor on the packet.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in central Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of arranging goods by shelves.
"I used to have an hour to unload the new batch, and now four hours," he complains.
“The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it’s all over, we’re closing the store,” he says, pulling his hands up.
To miss the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane found mechanical malfunctions and was replaced by another plane that we were expecting.
Thus, I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Getting to the airport while waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help here.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in children’s development are expressing themselves in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to distract from interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of boredom pass by us.
Maybe we should try to get bored?
Yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
Previously, I, like many, thought that boredom was an invention relatively recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
“In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin inscriptions of boredom dating back to the first century.
There is still an open question about how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, adjunct professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
Studying the research materials on this topic and asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boring is when people “want, but can’t do, what would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a boring person doesn’t do something he wants to do.
I don’t want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in the experiencing boredom, he says, is "a violation of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is running out slowly."
According to the description, boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, people who are bored see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people who are depressed see problems in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored when in fact we just find it difficult to focus on something.
In his study, “The Unbearable Mind: Determination of Attention Fatigue,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to a previously conducted experiment whose journal participants listened to a recording of the voice.
Some of the participants also heard loud noises outside of the TV program included in the neighboring room, others heard the same low-noise sounds, so they could hardly be heard, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without the sound of strangers.
Those participants who heard a low-noise TV noted that they were bored, more often than others – they were hard to focus on, but they didn’t know the reasons for it and attributed it to boredom.
When we’re trying to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fensk, adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.”
It is believed that when people start to climb on a chair or draw karakuli on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The study showed that children who are not prohibited from snoring and snoring are learning better and remembering more information than children who are required to sit down,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point we all experience boredom: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching a non-interesting film.
However, different people show different degrees of tendency to boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual features, the researchers developed a special "scan to boredom scale".
To determine a score on such a scale, questions and affirmations are used, such as “A lot of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonously” or “I’m too much interested, so there’s no time for anything.”
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially if there are a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teens said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what kind of data would be on boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "at adolescence there is a peak of tendency to boredom", mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let’s go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes it is not, because in extreme manifestations it can, as research shows, push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or abuse certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
“So our brain tells us to do something else; that’s boring,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this same brain does not always know what is best to do.
If you get bored and you focus that energy on playing the guitar or cooking experiences, you’ll make yourself better.
However, if you are going to watch TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment,” says Professor Fenske.
“And such skills of self-regulation are involved in a wide variety of situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to do something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think the boredom needs to be exaggerated.
However, to think of it as something bad is also not worth it.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of actions and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with this.
“We see this in a way that we need to experience boredom more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, tireless desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people try to get away from constant worries and just relax.
“In today’s world, we’re used to the constant overstimulation of the sense organs, and when there’s silence, we’re lost and we don’t know what to do.”
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana will apply in the state of Colorado.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a public college student in the southeastern state of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence, which is that it will soon be completely legal in the entire territory of the state: the storage of a small pot.
Mr. Orosco says that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar and drove in a car on the prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.
After the policeman found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco came to court for the storage of drugs and possession of a drug-using device - minor offences, for each of which a fine of $100 is due - and awarded to the court.
“They treat us like criminals,” says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize marijuana use in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small lawsuits is not so much dependent on the law as on the place of consideration.
The accusations of minor marijuana-related offenses have already been made in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped bringing charges against people aged 21 and older for storing small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative counties of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana-related cases and have previously been held accountable for the storage of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, voting to prevent the emergence of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
“All this is developing so rapidly that I don’t even know what to expect next,” says Daniel J. Outs, the police chief in the town of Aurora east of Denver.
Representatives of the controlling bodies in the state of Washington are also puzzled by their heads.
They will have to form rules to determine the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this needs to be done by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it’s good or bad, is ahead of most other states in solving marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, it’s a more orderly market, so they’ll serve as a good example,” said Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board of Regulators for Production and Sale of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than to put forward some proposals and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could focus on,” he says.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will come into force on December 6 and for a whole year will bring the state into a state of uncertainty when state licensing systems are not yet in place, and the right to own marijuana is already legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, how to find the balance between the state’s provision for “adequate access” to a licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds, and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading enterprises in cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” said Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly created research group, the Center for the Legalization of Marijuana.
On 21 November, police chief Outs of Aurora sent a message to his subordinates by e-mail that the city's prosecutor's office will no longer involve persons who have reached the age of 21, responsible for possession of a small number of marijuana, and that the police "responsibility of this disruption stops putting people on the streets.
The Chief of Police, Outs, said the police would monitor compliance in the city with regulations regulating the activities of marijuana growers for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The Weld County Attorney in North Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor’s office would continue to be held responsible for marijuana possession, primarily in order to encourage its users to undergo a course of treatment.
Currently, 119 people have been charged with storing two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“The responsibility of our institution is to prosecute actions that are considered criminal at the time of their execution,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was ambiguous even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police of Grand Jankshne, the largest city in the district, no longer hold minors responsible for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger backed the decision, but also decided not to make any accusations over the already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
“I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it changes is our direct duty,” he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote supported the decision, including issues of marijuana use for entertainment in the state and legal system would not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of residents in different parts of the state revealed the ambiguity of the relationship of local authorities to the state’s experiment with marijuana.
“There’s a cultural barrier to this issue for district prosecutors,” said Sean Macalister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of marijuana-storage defendants and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve been chasing people for so long that they can’t really reconcile now that it’s not a crime anymore,” he says.
Colorado and Washington — the first states in which a small amount of marijuana is treated in the same way as alcohol — are destined to become an experimental country-wide field to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are fearfully awaiting instructions from federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will step down in this regard.
Despite a few of the broad resonant arrests of merchants and patients who used marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government in most cases gave good credit to marijuana trading for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau of Drug Control are unlikely to break into the house to confiscate a small packet of marijuana, however, they will hardly close their eyes to the state-regulated recreational marijuana store authorities, which are allowed under the new law.
Some cities in Colorado did not begin to expect the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, which could not have opened earlier than a year later.
Last week, the city of Montrose, in the western part of the state, put a six-month ban on marijuana trading, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position to give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
The city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was saved from Oxford because I was a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the world’s best educational institution, a modern analogue of the ancient symposia, laying the two foundations of civilization—freedom and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the historic faculty of the University of Oxford’s Wuster College in the late eighties, I collected suitcases and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand and cry.
My friends were knocked down.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had to leave because I had to drink from a broken cup.
Actually, it wasn't so much fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically bitten and scared.
It’s not because of my rather unusual name or what I learned in private school.
I was only consumed for one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it seemed real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a famous adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You may ask, why do you think about it now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students adhering to the right centrist views is subjected to the same trauma.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of Conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that granted to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the Christie Corps College student club in Cambridge say they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They wanted to introduce an additional representative to the Equal Rights Committee of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by the recently released BBC 2 documentary about the student environment policy “Country of Miracles: Young, Smart and Right”, in which conservatives were introduced by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film features Joe Cook, a former president of the Oxford University Association of Conservatives, who rides in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and a chest of drawers with a silver lining.
In other universities, students-conservatives complain that they are making “launches of dismissals because of increased tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Association of Conservatives at the University of Nottingham, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers, said that “in the university environment, there is an increase in interference with left views.
“People who don’t even know us are presumptuous and innocently considered to be the great children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the historical faculty of the Corpus Christi College, in which a request for reinforcement of the defense was made, called such an atmosphere "unusual", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Association of Conservatives of the Oxford University of Applied Sciences, said.
“This poses a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and to the normal lives of the members of the club,” she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, a hardworking and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was plagued with hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year before that, the university had deprived former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even for Stalinists.
In the first days of the first week of primary school, when students get to know each other and teachers, I felt for the first time what was waiting for me in front of me.
I did not know yet that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the trauma of conservative students, but they also gladly took part in it themselves.
Political issues — the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s unwillingness to impose sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa — have penetrated through the wood-paneled walls of the audience.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now deceased Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text gave me a hard time, I shut down.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a cake-like face.
"The Thatchers don't basically learn French or they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students were killed.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take a few early French lessons in your spare time if you’re not very busy, of course, turning around in society,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely unlucky.
That night in college, I was sitting alone for lunch, and then someone grabbed me by the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the Faculty of English, who presented himself as a member of the University's Association of Conservatives.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Everyone who is suspected of sympathizing with the conservatives will be fooled.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be harder for you.
Most of the first-year conservatives pretend to be Labourers.”
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hypothesize.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Margaret Thatcher says.
The speed didn't work.
A first-year student at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Athens, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
The other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
“How do conservatives have sex?” one of them asked.
- They're picking each other up, aren't they?
I felt as if I must have felt homosexuals before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I just have to meet the same-sex couples under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labourer and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell to me, full of pursuits and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn’t hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for being an advisor to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of its pioneers.
He hardly showed up in college.
He despised it for its provinciality, pettyness, and commitment to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parent’s home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unprejudiced capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were adopted there.
“But it’s the best university in the world,” he said.
- They can't do that, but not in the city of sleeping spies...
Even my Communist friends have always acted flawlessly.”
His wet eyes were blurry.
“Don’t make quick decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You’ll break my heart if you leave the university.”
I was bored with regular trips to London and my emotional defenses were weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, couldn’t stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when the next teacher of history called me “the enemy of the people” quite seriously, I decided to do the same.
In my soul burning with shame, I admitted that "I was brainwashed by my parents" and called them "old fools."
The advance was short.
The last nail on the top of my career grave in Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I picked up the suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a squid and a squid.
But in eighteen years, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in a school.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind the unearned reputation of a university in which equality and free will are valued.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of fame"
About the exhibition "Valentino: master sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemisca and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital, worthy to take the exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentino: The Master of sewing, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which - "or Signor" Garavani, however, it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of knowing.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which is open until March 3, there are plenty of personal letters and photographs signed by the most famous aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowden, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Prince.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from the modest port from the city of Voger in northern Italy to the kumir of the international "elite".
To be in love with the royal court - there's nothing wrong with that.
“They at least don’t throw out their cigarette butts about your great cover, as some great pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitsa.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an incomparable host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all really enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains ex-wife Haini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Angelli or Evgenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
Despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Macza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Macza is reminiscent of a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to dinner with him at home, it was after a fashion show on the square of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her clothing, in food, in music.
“Valentino made each of the guests feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
“He never gets out of fashion, because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Paradigms
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of the Somerset House was transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and has to parade along the podium, looking at the "lookers" from the beams that swirl with the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the clothes
In this audience, such names as Sibilla Luxemburgskaya, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine from the models.
Natty Abascal and a model, in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino’s first love is “impossible to forget.”
I remember him very well.
These were pants, shirt, "jacket" and jackets from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he made for me,” says Nati Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
“I prefer him for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,” adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they “fit” his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia Della Jovampoola d'Arenberg also can't forget the first time she dressed for Valentine's Day.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to put on one of his evening toilets...
That time finally came in the late 90s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for a holiday in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with skirts, a "basket" in the fold and a cut without a bracelet.
“It was a dream that became a phenomenon,” says the widow of Rodrigo d’Arenberg.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d’Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the modeler with “maximum care... because the dress is not just a dress, it’s also a set of memories that accompany it.”
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the fashion designer calls their seams) to make this silk-coloured dress of ivory with a pearly incrust, twelve species of different circles and a four-and-a-half-meter-wide scarf.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents the height of the fashion of the late 20th century, "returning customers from the highest light".
Odoured by the elite’s “lifestyle” for many years, Valentino is now its best representative.
The Knight of the Great Cross (a mark of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Labor, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Literacy, awarded by the Order of the Legion of Honour, Garavani collected as much honors as any of his clients' spouses.
“My attention has always been drawn to his subtlety, his calmness, his careful and flawless appearance,” recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a festive dinner at the Orsa Museum.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
“He was ruthless, time doesn’t exist for him.”
If that's what the princess said...
The world's most difficult profession: miners from Kavah-Ijen
Indonesian miners risk their lives and health for four euros, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them, Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living from sulfur mines in the Kawah-Idgen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes when in contact with the air.
The huge pieces of gray, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, lowers the baskets on his shoulders and carries them upwards along the brittle stone road.
To the top of the volcano, the height of which is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, however, it takes more than 40 minutes to climb the tortoise step, with difficulty maintaining balance and carefully finding the road, so as not to fall back and fall back.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who broke away from the Kavah-Igen rock a few years ago.
The miners from Kavah-Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of cheese they produce
Turned up, they lay their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, step three kilometers to the weights that the mining company placed a little higher, at 1.
It is Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better yet, its employees, who it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euros cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical productions, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for making snacks, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
“As the norm is a 70-kilogram transfer, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems like a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than he would earn in the field.
“The daily wage for miners is very high according to local measures, where the cost of collecting coffee is 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the trucker, who previously worked as a stoneworker on the tourist island of Ba.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a heavy reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as the javelin, which was married to a deer, and I was married to a deer.
Anto has asthma, he breathes hard, coughs constantly, and he has tears in his eyes due to toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years, risking himself in Kavah-Ijene, the cheese of which has already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, constantly coughs, and he has tears in his eyes because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’ll work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he says in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or porter in a hotel, but instead he does the mullah’s work.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other bearers, it gets up every day at two o'clock in the night, because the gray does not cease to flow at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Throwing a shadow challenge, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
About 400 carriers are pushing baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the production of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work at their own expense and with such deductions.
In fact, they don’t even get parts of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photo collection, which, along with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people-moulds.
“This is work for cattle, not for humans,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root-carrier who has spent three decades at Kavah-Ijen since leaving college.
Being able to lift up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will endure the work “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains about their severe diseases... they are more serious, more painful than their problems
By balancing the basket on the back, the Unicorn can now only lift 50 kilograms at its 53 years old.
Every day, he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming the distance of 18 kilometers along the narrow path among the vegetation.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life,” Unaynik says, opening his mouth wide, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as a cheese handler.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what the human mules of Kawah-Igen are doing.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing prices and education for the lack of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we're going to fulfill our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of coin sticker advertising, but despite this — or perhaps because of this — this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings such as “Let’s put bao (bulk) in the oven” to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hopeful that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “their national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves like this, so we felt that this is the topic we need to touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, such as running spirits with pheromones or organizing fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don’t we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Who does not take it so lightly, is the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policy to encourage citizens to give birth to more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity and maternity leave, and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to his National Population Administration, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – which is known as the replacement percentage – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Department of Policy for Married Couples and Families of the National Population Administration, said the reason was “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to weddings and family-building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of single mothers and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration in order to counteract the shrinking population, is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is a barely-hidden xenophobia about many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and unwillingness to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year’s Singapore ruling party received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenses, and immigration policy, Singapore’s example also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build such a small house.
For example, it started to affect the real estate sector.
The city development management has switched to controlling the number of small apartments known as the "shoe box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters are sold very well.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a lousy lifestyle and devoid of the incentives of developers who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are bought out for a few days, even a week, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our incomes are increasing.
However, he admits that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers who have previously been recommended if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Excessively stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national birth rates, after talks with Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have a special effect.
“People are very stressed, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people postpone it,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them from raising children.
So no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to give birth to children, in terms of childbirth, the last word remains behind the Singaporeans.
Personal in offline - personal in online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is a property of private or "sphere of personal life, which have the right to protect against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that are being posed when discussing situations on the Internet that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five boys from 10 to 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", in the personal plane, and "password and username", when applied to social networks.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t have uploaded to the post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"It's very secretive, my mom might know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from the games.
I am also having fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a picture that isn’t mine, or someone who behaves stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to post indecent photos of naked people, crimes, or to write insulting or angry comments.
Jorge assures that he knows 35 friends he has on FB, and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is aware that she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're responding to me, I'm just downloading them," he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends more quickly,” he says.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from an unfamiliar person.
I wouldn't count on someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one looked at him in confidence and asked him for his home address or phone number.
“If they’re going to press or demand me, I’ll just remove them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
“He didn’t even know who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
“It’s just about privacy.”
It then explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
“Although I know it’s cyberbullying,” he confirms.
Key issues:
Marios Porras, an English teacher and education and training specialist, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a means of finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prenski, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the paper Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital aborigines are those, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning ourselves,” she says.
He explains that this topic is difficult, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is not enough for it.”
“Also so that they are selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do this is useless,” she adds.
Porras then lists some options: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to have a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from a party, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they should behave online the same way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as on social media,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read the policies of social networks in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reasons for talking to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published,” he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson “don’t talk to strangers”.
The UNASUR Summit ends without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, however sources from the Office and Administration of the President have indicated on the main page that it will be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that it will be published at a certain point in time.
On questions about the text, they pointed out that the content was set out by the President of Peru, Olianta Umala, during brief press statements.
Journalists’ access to information about the Summit was always limited.
During the day it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the presidential assembly without sound with the message "closed meeting, sound forbidden".
Little information circulated among reporters was provided by the press secretary of some of the UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not in Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused dissatisfaction with hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian president’s administration sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it is about Umala’s statement, not the official document that the summit ended.
Last October, Peru adopted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to provide transmission systems for all journalists, but limited access to information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins Monday in The Hague hearing of the statements of both sides, as part of an accusation that Lima has made against Santiago.
"We will respect and comply with a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently presenting in this international court," Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, a peaceful resolution of disagreements, pacts and international tribunals,” Pinera added, welcoming Umalu’s handshake against the flags of these two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice occurred immediately after Colombia protested this week against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact, according to which it acknowledged its submission to the judges of that international court after the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered was wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Olianta Umala, was responsible for the opening of discussions in the morning and for the closing of the summit, a little later in the afternoon in Limsk time.
The Head of State read out the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the directions of action for the 31 project among South American countries were approved, the amount of the proposed investments amounted to $17 billion.
Among the agreements he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we extend the residency agreements."
He said action was being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizens’ insecurity and against organized transnational crime, action to increase drug availability, low-cost access to the Internet in all parts of South America, and taking into account the combined and effective risk.”
As Europe is in crisis, “the economic union [of Latin America] should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and predict a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give the privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and are limited to the crossing axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between neighbors, was another theme underscored at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting to participate in the regional meeting, that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan colleague, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to hold negotiations in a respectful international form on the dispute, a bogot<0xC3><0xA1> in the seabed.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussions with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we are going to do this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they are scheduled to take up the post of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also during the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance for the adoption of the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the issue of protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter from the countries has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe on the question of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans “killed each other during World War II” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost one of a kind”.
He defended, in this context, the draft establishment of South American citizenship, which was endorsed by the countries participating in UNASUR.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but so far there are reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also expressed his support for the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and those who have signed the San Jose Covenant on Human Rights be taken into account.
Those who read the lectures never take on any obligations, and we, the South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for demanding to arrive on its territory for questioning about the alleged sex crime, while "only Swedish legislation considers it possible to carry it out through a video conference, which could be done in the lobby of the embassy."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of worsening Assange’s physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What it really is, is the danger of worsening his physical and mental health due to constipation in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
“It affects the health of any person,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum provided to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is based in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European Court of Justice.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use the word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European courts,” he said.
“If the UK gives a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will end,” he said.
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation allows it, and as it has already done in other cases, will question Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or ask him on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to demonstrate himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “immediateness, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression.”
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists, who support the alive, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he was pleased that neither these journalists nor the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemony do not dominate in Ecuador, and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto at UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support coups under the guise of legality" because in reality "it is a violation of the law".
In addition, the Ecuadorian president considered the “absolutely justified” desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to now negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favor of the Nicaraguan nikaragu.
At the moment, this decision is not being followed.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together in order to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute, which is being conducted in the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that “it is right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if the two countries commit to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be.”
Regarding the possibility of running as a candidate in the upcoming Ecuadorian presidential election to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that he is considering this possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult”.
Correa assured that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be rectified by political power.
“My political movement felt that it was precisely I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to acknowledge this responsibility,” he said.
In the event of a victory, this would be my last term as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
“That’s the solution,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he was going for a treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he is expected to miss a campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an exacerbation of President Chavez's health," he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
The death from AIDS today is the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS analysis gave him a positive result.
"I'm like a deaf man," he recalls the difficult one, despite all the doctor's tact, moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) hospital, where he arrived in 1994, having overcome a number of obstacles.
He lived with the diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. At the beginning of the 90s, it would be difficult to believe - there were too few treatment options then, too little knew about the disease, too biased about the disease.
Thus, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, “because he had a cut.”
In other words, having AIDS at that time was a punishment.
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so without poor quality of life.
However, not knowing about their disease, so far many people come when the virus has already caused damage, "stuck" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the greatest achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient, which begins treatment on time, and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", - said the head of the HIV department, Alysses, H.C.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva will explain that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depends on the degree of damage to the immune system, the disease, which is present in patients at the beginning
Simply put, the above means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Although death rates have dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients have died in the national base.
In Khalisko alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatal outcomes?
- Personally, I think the problem is not in access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, that's how things are going in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we haven’t had a shortage of medications, the problem is that patients come very late because they don’t know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so it is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide a cure for all the diseases.
According to the opinion of specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Khalid, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who applied for testing in a private laboratory, provoked only by the fact that he was a friend and did not look at it.
It all changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they will die and they don’t want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'd better get up three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, to promote his statement.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Preservatives behind the curtain
There is a huge gap between health programs and a simple citizen, according to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who dealt with the HIV-related problem.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, we were given one or two before, now we are given packages per hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“Why are they for you?” is a popular question, with driving and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and health workers who don’t want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not just behind the blinds and that hundreds of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
This is not an encouragement of decomposition.
It’s not about paying for a beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez replied when asked if it was possible to hand out condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Khalisko
A total of 13,435 cases were recorded (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and total cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are related to the sexual route, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people in one registered case who do not know about it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision, which annuls the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a deadline for any national company with branches located in the neighboring country.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the June 15 decision by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court of the northern district of Texas leaves defenseless Mexican firms facing the possibility of arresting their assets on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to the leading glass producer in Mexico for appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the trial judge notes that creditors must be regulated by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says the main proceedings concern the competitive proceedings under consideration in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of the enterprises of the transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-firm vote, the recognized in the critical mass of the competitive debt production that Vitro had before its parent subsidiary, would not have reached the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitions.
It is also true that by reading the votes of the branches, anyway the creditors of Vitro, who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely the hedge funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal is downgrading this data.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of a difficult situation he has faced since 2008, hit by a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States, strikes across the country.
Meanwhile, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family firm will appeal the decision in the appeals court itself to have the vote taken until his arrest, i.e. five judges, as only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application will be submitted for a certificate that will require a review by the Supreme Court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document addressed by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae ("second court"), which describes the process that Vitro follows under the Competition Act, signaling that it is freeing itself from compliance with agreements signed by the United States.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e., the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency that guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
Carambola from two boards: they beat Vitro and beat the country.
General balance sheet
Taking into account the months of complaints placed on the table by the trade unions of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the trade union association of pilots of aviators has already discovered the buggy.
The court, led by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney General’s Office of the Republic regarding the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the trust fund of Bank IXE, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional management company of hotels.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
Gathering on weekends at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We’re talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean country’s isolated country of products, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to counteract the monumental forces that have leveled off some of the protected territories from the ground and pose serious threats against industry.
Death of ACTA
With regard to the government’s rejected requirement of the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the Trade Agreement on Counterfeiting, known as an abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industry already in its possession.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the opportunity to view it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long run
Efforting to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, Homex’s housing developer places 500 million pesos of exchange certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with an offer to pay interest every 28 days.
The competition is coming to light.
Educated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the trade name Competitive has just emerged, its goal will be the market for software cluster services in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hettin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Busy basketball traveler Hector "Hettin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hettin" Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhage led him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small-class player, player of the Higher Basketball League, authorized and head of the BSN with Cuban President Fawboy.
“I’ve played many basketball roles throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamon, where he lives.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes is not exaggerating by making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotions he keeps those who remember his path through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Kovboev championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There have been many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's BSN debut.
From that moment on, Kuko Ortiz, who was a great administrator, continued to lead,” Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartov, who went here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who was at Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember what I said, if Minsey had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the championship of the Cowboys with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already meant to be the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minsi’s achievements in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian judge who made us replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best as well as the one that she won at Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that since the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortis) play on that team again, but also young (Havier) Tonito Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Fran<0xC3><0xA7>o and Edgar) and Mario "Kyhote" Morales, who did not participate in the 90-year-old Mario "Kyoke" Morales.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personal composition, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With cast members such as Canito Neves, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily removed for disorder in the Pan American Mar del Plata championship, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
His performances at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And that’s without taking into account his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From a young age, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participated in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that’s redundant.
At least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for managers, officials and judges.
This gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hemman has died.
Larry Hegman, born September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his lead role as John Ross Young, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a maniac without principles.
Larry Hegman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Young in the television series Dallas, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night from complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry has returned to his favorite hometown of Dallas, playing a landmark role again, which he liked the most," his family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving party.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hegman when he died in Dallas hospital, her representative, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived a full life,” Gray said in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor in the liver, and he underwent a transplant.
Long before "Dallas", Hegman gained fame on television due to his role as a regular in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gypsy girl played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well-received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the admirablely disgusting J.R. that brought Hegman to the top of the fame.
The CBS drama series about the Jung Clan and other characters in its surroundings aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan “Who shot at J.R.?”, designed to create noise around an episode full of emotions in which Hegman’s character is almost unkillable, spawned international discussions and the millions of dollars they risked in bookmaker’s accounts.
It also helped to bring the series to a record audience at that time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second most viewed entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH final, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s niece, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interfered with her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hegman played Yuing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put on treatment.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s grave slab," Hegman said in 1988.
It should be said, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Young."
This is the only deal he has lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hegman as someone "big, both on and off screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after Hegman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who excelled in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hegman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater scene in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t include anything that I thought would be able to hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told the Prensa Asociada.
After transplanting the liver, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and then,” he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it’ll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you’ll be fine.”
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starting a course that explores the “End of the World”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when a professor of religion, Stuart Sharma, decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an indelible charm: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, for which many people had been caught as evidence of what was happening.
But Charme had no idea what he expected in the next couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a financial crisis that some call the "long-rangeddon", and the growing conflict that drags Israel into a place where Christian theorists are running out of time.
“I didn’t realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what’s going on in the world right now, as if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic image of thoughts.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the topic of "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Templar, Adjunct Professor Barry Walker reads the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that trigger certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell students that it’s possible, probably, plausible and impossible,” Walker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, came together to read a course called simply "The End of the World".
“We don’t add ‘2012’ to always have the opportunity to read the course again if the end of the world doesn’t come,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent destruction”, students must study, prepare projects and pass the final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken in the canon of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work “until the very night the end of the world is supposed to come,” Restall said.
The courses have proven to be quite popular.
“The places ended in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-middle-point students, which enrolled 35 students.
We received emails many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Haddonfield School of Religion and Sociology, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old student at the department of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach that," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed — not to mention the professor — said they believed in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project affected the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course at Temple University in West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has several centuries in which people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about it,” he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any “end of the world” course there.
"The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the order of the Supreme Court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time there had been talk of many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period of remission.
Students and teachers are insecure about this date.
Some said they were going to the end of the world party.
“Maybe I’ll call one of my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications college student.
