The man's tall teeth are white.
Don't make me believe I'm going to meet you again.
Why are you crying?
Tom's staying close to the school he's running.
Do you smell English?
I can't just stay here.
The surrogate fall of the tree.
I'll take care of it.
Do you want to speak English?
He's got enough people, I don't know.
Good night.
You can cook.
She's crying.
They're invisible in sight.
It was one big summer day last June.
I'm not going home.
Greece is an old country.
She's not coming to Sunny.
What's wrong with you?
The car's black.
The car's white.
I guess I'm on the phone.
How much is enough?
Keiro is the largest resident in Africa.
This is my wife.
The car's good.
My wife didn't die.
It's a lie!
Welcome.
I'm going to have a heart attack.
Nagoya is between Tokyo and Osaka.
Tom's my boss.
I'm a man.
The key has been locked.
How many cars did Alex have?
Get her to move!
I want to write a book.
That beautiful woman is tall.
I used to wake up the first day.
That's what I'm afraid of!
One, two, three, four, five, six, six, six, eight, nine, ten.
My husband didn't die.
Elaine's in the hospital.
The car's blue.
There are many other questions that have to be asked.
The car's gone.
O Father, fear not, be thou in heaven: for thy name shall be holy: thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in heaven, as it is in heaven, so shall the earth be. And forgive us our sins, even as we also are in heaven: and deliver us from evil; and deliver us from evil: for to the intent that many sins may be forgiven thee, even so shall the heavenly Father bear the loss of all things, but thou shalt not forgive them.
The books of the Bible are an animal of prey.
This is my tent.
You've really helped us enough.
What's going on?
Where are the parents?
Nancy's in London.
This is a statement.
A hole is a little water.
It is a beautiful picture of peace.
All men are born to love and honor and respect. Tey has understanding and conscience and has to decide what to do with the rest of the brotherhood.
This is a rose.
I can't pay Tom today.
I need your help.
I made it clear that I've been working at the kitchen every day.
What are you looking for?
Where's the book?
Life is short.
The man's not young.
She's at Majorca and the sun.
Don't sound so good.
He's in the hospital.
I'm going to give you a hint of French.
I'll fly to Hanoi tomorrow.
There's only three generations in the class.
This new chair is a lavender blue.
I'm going to get a car.
How do I get to the bus stop?
The woman's not weak.
The car's empty.
I'll do it in English, French and Spanish.
It's your dog.
I've lost my money.
The man's right.
Yes, the seabed's gone.
I drank milk.
He's in good shape today.
Sitron is sure.
It's time to go!
She's playing guitar.
The days are coming.
The cat is not dead.
You don't seem to help me.
This is a surrogate tree.
A deep - seated picture of one peace.
Where's the weather?
I've got two cats.
I'm not a doctor.
It's obviously all over the building.
Are you working today?
The woman's tall.
I'm going to replace one sine of pennuts.
No one told me anything.
Emilia wrote that sentence.
I've got a line.
Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, six, eight, nine, ten.
Can I have a meal?
It's okay!
The books don't have teeth.
What's going on?
I know you're buying the most cheap way.
Man's a raffle man.
How about you?
Who did you see?
The car's green.
There's one app.
What changes are you making?
Thank you.
I can't believe this.
Tom's staying close to the school where he's going.
Both of you burned me!
Anyway, the problem with my mother is, I can't read hard.
It's wrong.
He used milk in his coffee.
The man's skin.
I don't speak Spanish.
How old are you?
This car is a vacuum cleaner.
He always looks nice.
You're kidding!
The car's fine.
I'm not out of my progress.
She's so close to her mother.
You can't go.
You know, I'm gonna keep this secret secret between you and me, thank you.
Rostov and Rostov-on-Don are two coastal villages, which are fairly far away from the coast.
He's just thinking about himself.
It's nice to see you need to go.
The surrogate's gone.
You must read the book.
This isn't a narcissist.
The airstrip at your fingertips.
And you're a lousy man.
She's amazing.
Can you show me the mark?
He's giving better away than he does.
I don't know the password.
I'm going to church.
I stood and thought about my children.
I could go to Boston.
Good boy!
I can do it.
I've left one book.
Unhappily handy.
Boston is an interesting creature.
Now the search is over.
Did you have a glass of tea?
He's already listed the book out.
I can't do that alone.
What are you going to do?
What's going on?
You believe me!
This is a horse.
What meat tastes better?
Tom's from Italy.
Germany has two main points.
The white man's right.
He's so poor as a church jury.
Call me after the wrong rule.
No one knows.
She's gonna check the music and dance.
I'm getting married.
Tom hated his ancestors.
Tom might be a lady.
It smelled like smoke.
Do you want to take the picture?
I don't pay the rent today.
Why?
That's my dog.
I'm a Muslim.
Drinking sugar on the dry side is turned upside down.
Today, a great multitude of people are flying by reason.
One thing is not enough.
Fuck off!
You're gonna have to put Tom on your feet.
Tom didn't tell me the keys.
He sees your horse.
I don't speak Japanese.
The tree is green.
Where's Paris?
The car's an appellant.
I'm sure he's a reporter.
He's never lying.
I'm not your mother.
Do you feel lonely?
If he had fallen into it, he went out into the kitchen.
My dogs are white.
I'm glad I'm good.
Go for one, or you'll be too late.
Tom's a communiqué.
I'm going to imagine a TV show.
He had been in Okinawa before.
Tom's a hero.
I'm glamorous.
Do you have a secret card?
She's a nurse.
Mary smells Japanese.
Call me after the wrong rule!
That tall woman is weak.
Help!
If the order is false, the opposite happens.
Do you like it?
Who's his friend?
He doesn't remember me.
What did you see in the dance last night?
I thought that hate wasn't no substitute for freedom.
What the hell are you?
New York's the biggest beer in the world.
I don't have to go to Denmark tomorrow.
Life is not a habit animal. If you lose your forest, you're full.
Are you in there?
I don't have time for school.
I used a cup of coffee in my coffee.
He's a teacher.
The flower's gone.
This is a beautiful country.
He drank a beer.
I dreamed of a cold night dream.
My brother's not here today.
Do you think so?
Rósa is a strong flower.
I can't go anywhere.
The car's broken.
This is his horse.
A bad woman goes over there.
Forget it.
I'm pretty sure you didn't want to bother us.
My sister is a bomber.
The airstrip in the middle of the eye.
We know what you're talking about.
Ken had been in New York for a while.
Life is a big motor vehicle.
Can I run your wordbook?
I remember having a guitar.
The template is a serene tortoise.
I don't think I should say that.
The world's greatest building is Burdj Khalifa.
I'm going to tell her.
You're gonna kill the only one for Eiriki, so he won't know.
Sunshine.
The book is on the table.
I'm a doctor.
I'm sick.
It's okay!
Tom's in the building.
There was a major operation, and the doors were often torn apart.
It was just a dream.
Good night.

I'm not sick.
We're in.
Tom and Mary ran to Boston this morning.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
How about you?
Sunday is the last day of the week.
I thought it was a threat.
What are you doing?
What's the course?
I told him he shouldn't have been touched.
The white roses are blue.
All have spoken of the protection of spiritual and potential interests in relation to one or more scientific, literary or literary works, which have been removed from the bones.
I know where he is.
What's wrong?
I've had enough fun.
I don't know if he's going.
Tom's leaving Kobe tomorrow morning.
Good morning.
You're older, you're better.
Do you love your mom?
Hata was looking good.
Happy Christmas!
Can you tell me what kind of man is going on here?
Good night, Tatoeba.
He can come from the sunglasses.
If you come from outside, or where you have so much being, join in singing a song.
What's your name?
Tom's close to his desk.
Nice to meet you.
He said he'd stopped.
Where can I go?
Betty went to sea.
The car's round.
I love milk and cheese.
The world's greatest building is Burdj Khalifa.
He's making things worse without a source.
A tall house was waiting for my house.
Are you happy now?
Tom is tolandi.
