What the hell is going on with you?
Let's go.
I mean, it's too much to say yes, isn't it?
Are you kidding me?
What is the purpose of life?
What do you think?
What's wrong with you?
You're going to have to put a finger on the trigger?
It's a bullet hole.
The heart of the Persians.
Is that how you're doing, too, too, too, too, too, Tom Kotido?
What's the piece of cake?
Is the output file ready?
Get out of here!

What do you want to do?
You know what?
This is Tommy's test?
What's going on?
Come on, let's go.
I'm sorry.
It's still hard.
Your right is empty.
Sorry, but you cannot play this game.
You must provide a non-empty name.
And now you're laughing at me.
That's crazy.
Come on.
That's the source of the nino?
Where's the tea?
Would you like to write a letter of pleasure?
What about your desk?
You're going to put your nose on?
Are you sure you want to quit?
What about these two?
Do you want to overwrite it?
Are you sure you want to move "%s" to the trash?
"To my heart?" "No."
How much space is that?
What day is it?
It's Emily's.

What's the matter?
Tom's office?
What's wrong with you?
That's what the sea is like.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God, it's so cool.
You son of a bitch.
That's where he's been.
He's not crazy.
It's different.
You're in the middle of a kard.
What's wrong with you?

The height is too large.
About Tommy's beer.
It's a beer.
He'll be right there.
You don't know.
Don't give me the money.
The destination is read-only.
That's great.
Fuck you.
That's how you like it?
Are you what you're talking about?
That's what Tom said.
Where's the euro going?
What's the weight of my weight?
How many times do you want to close the box?
How long has your dad been hiding?
It's not his grave!
Don't move.
That's Tommy's daughter.
Don't be so bad.
I'm looking at the p.
That's the month.
I'm sorry to hear that.
The lightning will blow.
I'm busy with this job.
That's how it works.
That's too high.
Come on, Tom.
That's what it's like.
That's what it's like.
What's wrong with that?
It's not like that, it's a shame.
That's what's going on.
This is the empty network name.
Don't worry about it.
That's how it works.
Hit my table!
I'm gonna go see her. She's gonna be fine.
Oh, my God.
That's it.
You don't know what you're talking about, Tom.
That's not funny.
What's the matter with you?
What a test.
This isn't happening.
I'm sorry.
That's a shame, bitch.
That's what he's edited.
Do you want to reassemble it?
What's wrong with Tom?
How long will this take you?
It's Tomra you heard.
This is Tommy's daughter.
That's what you're talking about.
What's that month?
That's what it's all about.
This is what the euro is or is short-lived.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's not fair.
It's a shadow.
Tell me what's going on.
It's a wedding, dinner dress.
That's bullshit, it's dinner.
You son of a bitch.
I don't know what to do with the six points.
It's so dark, it's dark, it's dark.
That's the police, Tommy.
I've got my hair cut off.
Come on, Tommy.
It's about six o'clock in the morning.
I invited her in and gave her a glass of wine.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I've been in the car for two minutes, and I've been in the snow.
It's getting worse.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I've got my own shoes on my desk.
That's what you're talking about.
This is the password you want to use for the calendar '%s'.
That's a good thing to do with the rest of the world.
That's a little bit of a joke.
It's an asnaw thing.
Close this tab even if it is locked.
This is your network.
That's what you're doing.
So let's go back to the important one.
It's not possible to get here.
It's too bad.
It's going down to the tower, and it's on the ground.
It's too late for the universe.
That's it, bitch.
They love you.
That's the voodoo. What?
What a contrast to the harsh and self - centered leaders of other lands!
It's his fault, isn't it?
It's not his fault.
That's the way it's going.
Don't be silly.
This is the story of the show.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
Don't be stupid.
That's what it's like.

How's Tom doing?
Tom, how are you?
Tom jinto?
What's that?
It's short to the end of it.
I'll be right back.
The dark Tom and Mary are on the table.
That's right, Tom.
That's what I'm saying.
It's a bit of a diet.
It's my moon and my cloud.
I've got my nose and my nose.
That's what he's got.
I've seen how far we've gone.
I'm gonna go get her out of here.
It's his fault.
The Ercano.
I don't know what to do.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
I don't believe in hell.
The weather's over.
It's not like it's a month away.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That was a heart attack.
It's coming back to the moon.
It's a 32-pound wall.
This is not surprising.
Don't come back, dear father.
I'm gonna take a look at this thing.
That's what's gonna happen to Mary with the pie.
That's what it's all about.
It's a messy story.
That's not a big deal, man.
That's what you're saying.
The last time Empty Junk was run.
It's not the same thing.
Don't eat it.
That's our fault, Charley.
It's not a good idea or a bad idea.
Or it's in the back.
Come on!
It's still a gold mine bank.
It's the same thing.
Come on, it's okay.
Give your daughter a hug.
Well, we'll stay.
Let's talk to you.
The truth is that one person’s heart is treacherous.

You know, I've got a secret girl.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
It's the card.
Maya and keep going.
My name is Maria Saraya.
Let's see what's going on.
And your mouth is white.
I'm sorry to hear that.
You don't want a dog or something?
It's okay.
What's wrong with me?
I'll be right back.
I'm sure you'll get it.
I'll just cut it off.
If I didn't, I wouldn't.
That's it.
You're gonna stop it.
Stop it, baby.
You don't have to.
I'll see you later.
That's what you're looking at.

Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Did you say, "Who's the asshole?"
It's not like that.
The moon's falling.
It was the month of the month of his death.
It's about the beginning of the month.
He's a pexil.
He's coming.
Switches to the next tab.
It's a face tool, it's a red one.
What's the month? "What's the map?"
At first, I resisted temptation.
It's a little bit of a rhyme.
The air is gone.
Sorry, but you must specify a non-blank keyword for the disc image.
And the key's gone.
Is that a piece of wood in the right-hand corner?
Wech rakew, Timmy.
You're sick.
It's a piece of paper.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You did not select a document.
Come on, old man, he's drunk.
I'm gonna get two of them.
The theater's still on.
O thou dearest, continue.
It's time for the show.
It's too late!
The time zone is loading.

Don't worry about it.
It's Tom.
I don't get it, do I?
Take it easy.
In Liligendo, it's called kh'ano.
I'm sorry to hear that.
The dog's gone.
I'm not going anywhere.

I'm sorry to hear that.
I don't know.
That's what it's like.
I'm sorry.
But it's good again.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I'll see you later.
But you know Tommy's coming.
I'm sorry.
This is a big piece of shit.
Thank you, Tatoeba!
What about Tom?
The fish's early release.
The size of the volume.
It's a dead body.
The fish's name.
Madé Tommy's gone.
It's too late.
The size of the volume.
But it was worth it.
You're welcome.
Whether to drink wine or not.
I'm not going to make it.

It's gonna be a lot of fun.
The wine ran short.
It's a short walk away.
It's on the roof.

Are you still there?
Do you want to continue?
Are you sure you want to help Tomdo?
A euro for you?
What's your name?

Where are you going?
When was the last time that the soldier left the army?
How many times do you think you're going to lose your mind?
You're out of your mind, right?
What's up, man?
Is the moon bright?
No, not even Tommy, not him!
It's like a black rock.
I'm sorry.
It's just a few minutes late.
It's too late.
He's gonna take a look at it.
