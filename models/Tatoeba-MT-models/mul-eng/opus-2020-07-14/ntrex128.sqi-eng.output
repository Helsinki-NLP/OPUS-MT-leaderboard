Wells Assembly members worried that they're "lookin' like idiots"
In the midst of some of the Assembly members, a concern has been raised regarding the proposal to change their title in the MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly in the "Wells Parliament".
Members of the Assembly from all political spheres are concerned that this could stimulate the dance.
A member of the Laburist Party's assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For the outside readers of Wells: In secular terms, twp means "foolla" and pwp means "who".
A member of the Welsh Party said the whole group was "unsatisfied" and has proposed an alternative.
A Welsh conservator said his group was "meaning" about the change in the name, but it was said that there was a little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the pronunciation of the word "w" in Welsh is similar to that of the word "w" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up legislation on the publication of the change in names, said: "Of course the final decision to name Assembly Members will depend on the members themselves."
The law of the Wells Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly a sign to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the latest proposal for the assembly's name as "Wells Parliament" received extensive support.
With regard to the issue of the title of Assembly Members, the Commission promoted the name "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a consultation with the public.
It seems that Assembly members are suggesting alternative elections, but the struggle for reaching consensus can turn into a shock for Creator Elin Jones, from which the presentation of legislation on changes is expected within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of Assembly Members and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their name will remain with the Assembly Members.
Macedonians vote in the referendum to change the country's names.
On Sunday, voters will vote for the change in their country's name in the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote by the people was put in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbor Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour bears claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a counter-referencing opponent for the change of name, has said he will not recognize the votes.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is simply the price to be paid for membership in the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin’s bells fell into silence, while the churches in Harlem faced difficulties
"Historicly, the elderly people I talked to said that he had a bar from a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"They both miss you."
He said that the loss of colors is understandable.
"In today's world, people socialize in other ways," he says.
"The bars are no longer a mess, where people go regularly."
As for churches, he expresses concern that money from the sale of property will not go as far as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by walls full of people who will not support the holy lands that remain in the valley.
"Many of the people who buy environmental housing in these palaces are white," he said, "so soon it will be the day when these churches are closed once well, since it is the payment that most people who decide to be members of these churches are in these homes."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem was converted to a coloring metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade later.
The original white methodical congregation was transferred in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was purchased by a colorful congregation of people who had their place of worship there.
John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of small traders on the "125th" road, was passed by a colorful congregation of people under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who refused to work or promote people with color.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's famous repair plans were made, they ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and son of Martin's heir, called the career "the association of the poor."
An expert who played in the Korean career called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and a "historical non-replaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also said that this was the first career in the world to be played by a colorist, Dionysius A. Lind, who was transferred to a major career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not replaced it.
The events of the last months in St. Martin have been an interdependency of the architects and contractors, some sent by church leaders and others from the Episcopal Diocese.
The council - the governing body of Famullis, part of the lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that she "will try to transfer the costs" to the council of Famullis, although the latter was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some family members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the teacher.
Fishing the wounds of 13-year-olds during a search to catch caves in California
A fish has attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he's trying to catch gas in California, on the day of the opening season, officials say.
Sulmi happened just before 7:00 a.m., near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel was told about the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been hanging out with some friends about half an hour in the morning when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then he had drove his way along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had initially thought that the boy was just exaggerated by the arrest of a gunman, but then "I realized that he was burning me!
I'm hungry!"
Hammel says that when he reached the boy, his whole keyboard was empty.
"They shot everyone out of the water: "There's a fish in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the "Rady's" Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was sent to critically.
The fishing species responsible for the attack was unknown.
Captain Larry Giles spoke at a media conference that a fish was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was designated as a unique species of fish.
Giles added that the victim had suffered trauma in the upper part of the body.
Officials stopped accessing the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of fish in the area, but most of them are considered to be native.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the MB cosmetic market
Saninsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetics of the style of big shops, with a specialized sales post.
Within a considerable effort to enter the 2,8 billion-dollar MB cosmetic market, which is continuing to grow while the sales of fashionable clothing and household clocks are falling, the biggest cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores around the country and will be opened in more shops next year if they succeed.
Cosmetic investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the gaps of waste that are sometimes used for television, microwaves, and household waste.
Sanisbury's has been said to double his offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time also brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with dedicated areas for brands, similar to what happens in stores like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will re-market its Boutique cosmetic line, so that most of the products are covered by cotton — something that is increasingly required by the buyers of the newer ones.
In addition, a retail trader "Fragrance Shop" will test concessions in two Saninsbury stores, the first one opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online bills and a trend towards daily food collection in small quantities in the stores of the market mean that supermarkets now need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Saninsbury, has said that the outlets will start to look ever more like big shops, while the supermarket network is trying to fight Aldi's price oils and Lidl's oil with more services and jewelry products.
Saninsbury's has set out the "Argos" outlets in hundreds of stores and presented a series of "Habits" that, after the two networks were opened two years ago, which according to him, has promoted food sales and has made them more profitable.
The early efforts of the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sanisbury's tested a partnership with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the merger broke out after a debate on how to split income from pharmaceuticals into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Saninsbury sold his pharmaceutical business from 281 stores of Celesio, owners of the Loyds pharmaceutical network for 125 million pounds.
He said "Lloyds" would play a role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands of leather, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Saninsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the view of our cosmetic landscapes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized staff, which will be ready to give advice.
The size of our brands is designed in such a way that all the needs are met, and the environment of attracting and volunteer locations show that we are now a cosmetic destination of honey, which separates from the old way of making flowers."
Peter Jones "skinned" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million-pound deal.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, has gone "gandous" after Holly Willoughby's TV show has been withdrawn from an 11 million-pound deal with his business dedicated to a dedicated lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home halls and "Truly" accessories.
The business of these two was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" presentation was directed to Instagram to announce its departure.
Holly Willoughby has introduced the star of "Dragons Den", Peter Jones, after the recent withdrawal from their firm dedicated a dedicated lifestyle - to focus on her new promising contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
The sources say Jones was "skinned" when the gold girl of the television accepted during a tenure meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant that she did not have enough time to allocate their domestic currency and assets to Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was predicted to double its property estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, was directed to the Instagram to release her departure from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his rest houses.
A source has been expressed: "Truly was a failure in the heads of Holly's priorities.
It would be her future for the long time she would be joining her in the decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw all the persons involved is completely supported.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close.
In the Marlow offices there is a magazine full of furniture ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, can cost millions of dollars, due to considerable investment in products starting from shoes and shoes to clothing and household clocks, and to cause further delays in opening them.
And this could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her partner Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined her director in March.
Many spend their vacations together, and Jones has 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to be the ambassador of the brand for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the representative of "I'm A Celebrity" and the ITV.
Last night, a source near Jones was said "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
Strong talk "and then we're in love"
He made a joke about the criticisms that he would get from the media because of his comment, which some would call him "he belongs to a president", and because of the positivity associated with North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump been given so much?
Tha Trump, by playing with the voice of news reporters.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said that Kim was interested in a second meeting, after their first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear power.
But the negotiations on nuclearism have been interrupted.
More than three months after Wednesday's summit in Singapore, Korea's top diplomat, Reyong Ho, was directed to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, saying that Norway sees no "responsive reaction" from the United States for the first steps taken by North Korea to nuclearization.
Rather, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping under pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic view of his interview.
"The things are going better with North Korea," he said.
"We were fighting North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results - stopping the missile testing, helping to free the obstacles, and returning to the home of the rest of the American soldiers.
In his speech concerning relationships with Kim, he protected his undisclosed hair.
"It's very easy to behave as President, but instead of having 10,000 out there trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 ourselves standing there," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd towards him.
The famine and drought in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the bombing in Lombok, for example, foreign disadvantaged organizations told them that their presence was not necessary.
Despite more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok, no national disaster has been reported, which is likely prior to catalysing international aid.
"Unhappily, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," said Mrs. Sumbong.
While "Save the Children" is raising a team to travel to Palu, it is still not sure if a foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, director of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Having seen the widespread earthquakes that afflict Indonesia, the country remains unprejudiced in the face of nature’s anger.
While buildings are built in Aceh against pollution, they are difficult to find in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the warning of pollution in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, travel between many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural defects make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake is traveling towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo used the improvement of Indonesia's steel infrastructure as the central point of his electoral campaign, and has invested a lot of green money for roads and roads.
But the lack of funding has concerned Mr. Joko's administration, while he is facing new choices that will develop next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from continuing sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after the deployment of Christian and Muslim groups in the streets, where they have been used for hunting, hunting, and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool marks a parallel wave against Chelsea in the last few minutes
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a loss in Premier League against Chelsea, with a drop in the 89th minute of September at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a ride from Jordan Shaqiri to take about 30 yards away from the Chelsea gate, while his team was missing with the 1-0 result.
He pushed the ball into his left before he hit the other door.
Topi flew over the area until he turned to the right and the top of the network.
The Topi saved the air raid on Kepa Arrizabalga and ended up on the network.
"The idea was to put in the right position as to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls ahead, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the bag with a hit and I didn't think for a long time but just hit."
Chelsea was headed by the result 1-0 in the first part, after a gol in the 25th minute from the Belgian east Eden Hazard.
The blue sculptor made a review of Matthew Kovacic during that game, before traveling near the field and headed back to Liverpool’s half-face.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave me a beautiful vertical trace that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard crossed the defense at speed, and with a left-hand hit, noted in the second pillar, passing the summit after Liverpool’s portier walls, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet Naples in the phase of the Campus Law groups on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton at the UEFA European Law on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of people who died from malnutrition in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of deaths from drought and hunger in Indonesia has increased in 832, a national disaster agency has been declared on Sunday's first hour.
According to reports, many people have been blocked under the roofs of exemplary buildings from 7.5 walls that fell on Friday and caused noise to up to 20 feet high, says the agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been established under the foundations of exemplary buildings.

I would also like to call everyone, especially tax drivers, who may have video footage, to contact us after they can have important information on our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a Banana of Birkenhead and her body has been found inside a pool.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman had reached the stage to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue, while the police have said it's informing the victims' families.
A resident taxi driver in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but he's been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament, last monument touched by the debate for "review of history"
Her disappearance would be a deserved punishment for the destruction of many Taliban from England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatic persecutors.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "recording" and "examination of history".
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell's Society, said: "In the middle of the current debate on the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's image would be filmed outside the Westminster Palace.
The iconicism of English civil wars was neither ordered nor led by Cromwell.
Maybe this would be a wrong Cromwell sacrifice for his ancestors' actions in the past century.
Cromwell's excellent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure for which many think they still deserve praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said about "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defence of parliament from external pressure, which was certainly, in his case, monarchy.
The fact that this is a perfectly accurate portrait is the object of continuous historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict between the 17th century gave shape to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure that represents a part of that mediation.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Deadly Killing the Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a thief in a market in southern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his upper "Yuan", has been found with a solid artery and covered in blood near a dead body market in Liupanshi in the province of Guizhou, reports South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A dry farm is ready to inject the waste vaccine at a table on 30 May 2005, in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yuan on Wednesday, to sell 15 dollars on the market.
On the other hand, his companion found him lying on the bed, and he discovered the door of an opening chair there.
He's said there's a big man in the chair with his mouth with blood.
A medical examination has confirmed that up to 550 pounds has damaged the farmer for death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were torn and cut," said his cousin identified with the nickname "Wu," as mentioned in the evening news in Guiyang.
In photos filmed by security cameras, Yuan is seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his doors.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man didn't cover Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has reported on the news last night that the thief had been kept in isolation to prevent another attack while the police collected evidence in the area.
According to reports, Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Even though it is rare, the experiences of people who have been hit by doors have been noted before.
In 2016 a thief attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious pain to the man.
Ten years ago, a rain of 650 pounds brought a Welsh farmer after his tractor, until his wife threw the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was cut off from his garden in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to the CBC News that normally, the trees are not aggressive, but blood salt can act as "stimulating".
"They just want to play.
They're like your little cousins... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The effects of the Rosa hurricanes are expected to bring widespread droughts in the South of the United States
As foretold, the strength of the Rosa urgan is rising as it moves towards the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will cause injuries due to floods in North Mexico and in the South American.
On Sunday, on Friday morning, at 5 a.m., Rosa joined in the race of 85 miles an hour, being classified as Category 1, and it took 385 miles to South West of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is waiting to move to the North on Sunday.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific Ocean it is starting to form a low-air pressure zone that moves towards the West, towards the United States' West Coast. As Rosa is expected to approach the Bay California gaudy on Monday at the top of a tropical storm, she will continue to push the great tropical failure towards her north, towards the south-west US direction.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the effect of tropical failure on the low-pressure zone will cause severe flooding in the south in the next days.
At local level, rivers of 1 to 4 inches will cause sudden floods, floods of waste and possible earthquakes in the desert.
The high drop in tropical will make the standard of living in the designated areas reach approximately 2 to 3 inches an hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and the southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches are predicted in some areas of South-West, mainly on a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of sudden floods with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the widespread nature of tropical rain forests.
Because of the risk of tropical storms, it is not recommended that you walk through the desert with your feet.
Large rivers can turn cannons into powerful rivers, and the rocks will bring strong waves and blow dust into the area.
Affirmation of the low-pressure atmosphere will bring great rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
The total number of rows can be reached on half an inch, resulting in a small increase in the length of the remaining ones and the path of the loops.
For the region, these will be the first season of the silver season.
Several tropical raindrops will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday and on Monday morning, before the rain forests expand further on Monday and on Tuesday evening.
Strong winds will be unleashed on the four sides of the night and will continue until Wednesday.
The U.S. theater can be characterised by high temperatures, reducing temperatures in Arctic, while tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperatures in short distances.
A good example is the dramatic difference of temperatures across the United States centrally on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to collect and rejuvenate.
A good part of the central and eastern United States is expected to begin October at a temperature of about 80, from the South to the designated part of the Northern Hemisphere.
New York City can reach 80 degrees Tuesday, the temperature that would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our weather forecast shows high chances of temperature on average in the United States early in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have followed the court session of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting witness of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of a sexual assault that was suspected of taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political blockades continued, and transmitters suspended regular programs to transmit the review in the last minute of the nine events: an agreement reached by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct a similar investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford said before the Senate's Judicial Committee that it is 100% sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and was trying to get him to a gymnasium party.
Kavanaugh, in a full - time witness, stated that it was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
It seems that the number of followers has been greater than that of 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen on the Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility in CBS, ABC, NCB, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The figures for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems with counting viewers from the offices.
To set this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
Channel Fox News, whose opinion strongly supported Kavanaugh's rise, led other networks with a average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest continued to be high even after the completion of the trial session.
Flake was the main character in the game.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was facing protests while trying to get into the elevator to go to the judicial session of the Judicial Committee.
In transmitting CNN’s number, he showed up standing down for a few minutes while being warned.
"I'm staying here, before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He said, “You have power, while there are so many women who have strength.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would have more to say during the committee's session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering the moment directly when the Judicial Committee would vote for Kavanaugh's candidate for vote in front of all Senate members.
But Flake said he would do this only with the confidence that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate for the next week, as he had asked for a few democratics.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a meeting with Coons and with some other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was smart, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has sought to open an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union that "they are playing political games" with Britain's future and compromise national interest, in an interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her plan for Brexit, so-called "Chequers", saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay taxes on each other is "caughtly absurd."
Wayde Sims gun murder: Police arrest Dytheon Simpson for the death of LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballist of the LSU team.
20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison environments under the warrant for murder without a warrant, the Director of Baton Rouge's Police has been represented.
Official sources have released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims had lost his eyes during the settlement.
The police have found his eyes on the location and says he's found Simpson's DNA tracks on them, reports CBS's WAFB branch.
After taking Simpson's question, the police said he admitted that he had been armed on Wayde, causing death.
The amount for his release was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
Baton Rouge's Lawyer Office has issued a preliminary report on Friday, which states that the cause of death has been a plague caused by fire from the head to the neck.
The Department appreciates the gravity of the arrests near the state police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for assistance with investigations leading to the arrest of the author.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the legislative authorities of the area for "their cell and for the position of justice in the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The boy with six feet and six inches in length grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits for each game.
On Friday morning, LSU's team coach, Will Wade, said that the team was "skinned" and "friended" by Wade's death.
"That's why we worry all the time," said Wade.
Vulcans are being burned on Mexico City
The river from the Volcano Popcatepet has reached the southern shores of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of Fatkecisives warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was refurbished and 183 hot gas releases were registered within 24 hours.
The center had been monitoring a number of injuries and injuries.
Social media images showed the heavy metal roofs of cars in some parts of Mexico City, such as Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have found an increase in the activity of the volcano, which takes place 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, when a 7.1-wave storm hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police replaced with separatists catalytics before the anniversary of the independence polls
Six persons have been arrested in Barcelona on the seventh day after the pro-invasion protests with peaceful police forces have been suspended, while thousands have joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polling vote for departure.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peaceful police forces, hit with waves and waves of power, creating new dark clouds along the roads that normally smell from tourists.
Later the day, there was also a cup of coffee, while the police had to use rubber chips to end the payments.
For a couple of hours, repeating the morning "We don't forget, we don't forgive," the pro-innovation groups faced the Union's protesters who set up the "Spain Rounds".
Forty persons were treated for minor injuries during protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where feelings for independence prevail, tensions continue to rise even a year after the 1st October referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by the separate catalytics.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although the participation was low, as citizens opposed to voting voted.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 of them remained injured last year after the police tried to stop the polls through the regional polls.
On Friday evening, the pro-invasive groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another turn.
Narcis Termes, an 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest together with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalan would win independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best times.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they would have the chance to vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite the fact that in the last December's local elections they achieved a vital victory, although with short results, the pro-invasive Catholic parties have had difficulty in maintaining their home this year, since many of their most well-known leaders have been either voluntarily removed from the country or are in favour of and awaiting the trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who was recording the protest on his cell phone with the police, said the conflict was fueled by the policy of the two camps.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in prison waiting for the trial last year, said he would vote for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidate's rejection of European elections is the best way to combat the regression of democratic values and the pressure made by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some arrested after the car was moved home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car has been parked several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 19:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damages were caused at the main gate and in the village itself.
It is thought that at a certain point, an arrow was thrown into the direction of the car.
Manga's confession to Livingston's a 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingstone guaranteed victory
The squads from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerard's second loss in 18 matches as team trainer from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's speech resulted in decisive results while Gary Holt's team compared the second country's hybrid score.
Gerard's team has not yet won an outdoor meeting in Premiership, this season and the next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which eight points are.
But ahead, Rangers will wait at Rapid Vienna's home, in the important struggle for the European Law on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of unique winners in six meetings, and Coach Holt has not yet experienced the loss since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost cases in front of well-deserved opponents
The Holt team must have been in advantage many minutes before they noticed, after their direct attacks caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass, but hit the weak at the door, and then Alan Lithgow hit the top in the direction after his head hit by Craig Halket.
The officials were ready to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems in standard attacks.
And that's how the goal of the meeting was made.
Rangers caused a beating, and Livingston created the space, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined creating Menga's potential, which hit and marked the center of the area.
Up to that point, Rangers had dominated to keep the ball, but local protection had resulted in disastrous results, and Porter Liam Kelly had not been put almost anywhere in the test,
This way the game continued in the second part even though Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to wait.
Scott Pittman's speech was stopped by Rangers' Porter Allan McGregor while Lithgow was hit by another standard hit by Livingston.
The arrests continued to take place in Livingstone’s area, while two allegations of imprisonment — after Halket’s intervention to the players who came as substitutes, Glenn Middleton, and another for hand - to - hand arrest — were not taken into consideration.
Liverston Game - Analysis
Alasadair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Island
A performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they played a beautiful game and continued to raise expectations in this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team has not changed much since their return to the top, but a great honor belongs to Holt because he elects the team from his arrival.
He had a lot of heroin.
Captain Halket was extraordinary, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the struggle.
However, Rangers had lacked spirituality.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerard’s guidance, they lacked quality.
There was a lack of final follow-up -- only once they reached the opposite defense -- and this is something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, which they find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting for a double feeling in Colonje
On September 29th (September 29th) he was characterized by a loud voice from the sky as Turkey’s leaders and Germany met for the morning in Berlin.

A cyclist has found death after being hit by a car in London.
The incident took place near Bestworg Street's crossing with Evelyn Street, a traffic route loaded in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and the emergency assistant arrived right away, but the victim changed his life.

Long Lartin castle: Six officers wounded during a rebellion
Six prison officials have remained injured during a strike in a high-security prison for men, the Burges Office has said.
The rebellion broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, and continues.
Specialized officers of "Tornado" have been called to keep under the control of tortures, which include eight prisoners, who have been confined to a prison camp.
Officers have been treated in a settlement for some simple injuries in the face.
A spokesman for the Burgess Service said: "The specialized training staff is mobilized to keep under control of the incident currently taking place in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will refer to the police and may be punished with imprisonment."
HMP Long Martin strikes over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been subjected to hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, peaceful police officers were called into prison to keep a serious situation under control, where personnel were attacked with billiards.
Urgani Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which can be beneficial for coastal areas)
Although it is rare that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, this is precisely what will happen in the first few days of the next week, as the remaining strength of the Rosary passes through the desert of the South, spreading the risk of sudden extinction.
The Meterologic National Service has already issued warnings for immediate closures on Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to South-West Nevada, South California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday afternoon with rain showers.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix expressed in a tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have taken the status of shock or tropical depression at a rate of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from Arizona's border."
The latest Uragane National Centre models predict 2 to 4 inches in diameter, with an isolated amount up to 6 inches in the Arizona border of Mogollon.
In other areas of the desert in the South, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, the rivers are expected to be at levels 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate massacres, Rosa's routes can be a blessing, as the region has been hit by the tsunami.
Although the floods are a serious concern, some of these conditions may be beneficial, since the South is currently facing harsh conditions.
According to the U.S. Center for the Monitoring of Tattsier, a little over 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme hardship of the second category," said weather.com.
At first, the Russians will defeat the Gulf of California in Mexico.
Rosa, still powerful in Uganda on Sunday morning, with 85 miles of maximum speed per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
Stoya is fighting with cold waters over the Pacific, and it's losing power.
On the other hand, it is expected that you will be able to reach Mexico with a tropical storm on the afternoon or on the evening of Monday.
The tides over certain areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting a considerable risk of extinction.
"The rain of a medium level from 3 to 6 inches is expected from the California Bay to the Northern Sonor, and can reach up to 10 inches," said weather.com.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, on the side of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the first hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching Utah south on Tuesday evening.
"The main line expected by Rosa or its consequences are strong lines in Baja California, in the northwestern Sonor and in the southwestern desert of the United States," said the Uruguay National Centre.
These diseases are expected to cause sudden extinctions with life - threatening consequences, a decline in the desert and land degradation in the land.
In Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for the remaining killings in attempts
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old are arrested as suspects of the rest of the attempted murder, after a 16-year-old beating in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST of September.
He joined the hospital, where he is currently in a "sustainable" state.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Radstock.
Officials have called on anyone who might have been caught with cell phone video from the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh "is opposed to the subversiveness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "is faced with the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during its enlargement process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on the fourth day, disbelief and emotion of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had attacked her sexually ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness during the session concerning her case.
On Saturday, the President said that that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most thoughtful lawyers of our time, a judge with a record of pure public service," he said before the group of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president mentioned the increase in Kavanaugh during the talk on the importance of the participation of the Republican in the upcoming elections.
"Five weeks share us with one of the most important choices in our life.
I don't want to beg, but I'm contributing," he said.
"I'm doing so much effort and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to make "block resistance".
The first main procedural vote by the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to be developed no later than on the Friday, said CNN's assistant to a senior GOP director
Centers killed by earthquakes and famine in Indonesia, while figures are expected to grow
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were tried by the giant dragonflies who were thrown into the beach, when the Indonesian island Sulawesi was hit by a storm and eaten by the authorities on Saturday.
Tens of them were assembled for a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when high - heightd cliffs up to six feet (18 feet) were thrown into the back of the museum, trying to cause the death of many people and ruining everything before.
The food came after a 7.5-dollar drop.
"The next day, when the threat of pollution was born, people were still doing their normal activities on the beach, and to date they didn't immediately run away and hit his victim," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency.
"The town didn't come alone, he took his car, pushed, home, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the food had broken the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before reaching the coastal edge.
Some people went up to the tree to save their food and survive, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, sandy sands and examples, and a glass of water around it.
After the earthquake, the walls continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The dropouts were found in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) expressed in a statement that the energy generated by the massive nuclear storm was about three times the power of the atomic bomb dropped into Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which takes place at the level of a long and narrow journey, may have been multifaceted by the power of consumption, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great stones" and expressed that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels were examples.
Some kuffomas were found blocked under the walls of exemplary buildings, he said, adding that 540 were left injured and 29 were destroyed.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the extent of the damage could be much larger along the 300 km [150 km] north of Palu, in a area called Donghea, which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications networks "stop completely without any warning" from Donganda, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Creek said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers were traveling to the affected areas.
"It's already turned into a tragedy, but the situation may be worse," he said.
On the seventh day, the agency was critically unaware of Paul’s food attack, even though officials said that the Dutch had arrived at the time of the warning.
In amateur films distributed on social media, a man in the upper floor of a building can be heard by warning the climbers on the ground about the coming of the burning winds.
Within a few minutes, a wall is placed in the back, taking the building and the car with it.
Reuters could not verify the reality of the film immediately.
The earthquake and hunger caused a mass mass of energy that attracted communication around Palu, making it difficult to coordinate efforts to save from the authorities.
The army has begun sending small airplanes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuaters continue to have a great need for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is open only for rescue efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of food victims in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation's pretty serious.
While the World Vision stage by Donghea has reached without problems in the city of Palu, where workers are being placed in the backyards of their office, they have witnessed a scene of destruction along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They tell me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation's pretty serious.
Although relief teams began serious efforts to move humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external stage can only begin to circle if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Ariani, an Indonesian Red Crescent spokesman.
"After the government says "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can ask for national help, but this status has not yet been given."
On the second night after the earthquake and the dedication at Palu, friends and families of the missing persons still hoped that their loved ones would be among the few miracles that occur sometimes in natural disasters.
On the seventh day, a young boy was brought up from a village.
On Saturday, the rescue forces released a woman who had been living under the roof for two days, with her mother’s blanket beside her.
Gendon Subanono, the national team coach of Indonesian predictors, had trained two of the missing predictors for Asian Games, which were closed early this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people who were blocked at Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandanga, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of predictation, I am very emotionally loaded," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that in the hours following the round-up of the hotel's "Roa Roa" show among the presuppose community, he was trying hard to write to whatsApp competitors from Palu, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, ended only with a sign of grayishness, instead of two blue signs.
"I think this means that messages have not been sent," he said.
Haydens steal $26,750 during a bank repair in Newport in Levee

Canye West: Retires changing its name in Ye
Lieutenant Kane West will change his name to Ye.
Expressing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I am officially known as Kane West."
41-year-old West has been called with Y's nickname since, and has used it as the title of his eight album, which came to market in June.
The surprise came shortly before his departure on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons", the creator of the show was expressed.
Besides being a short short of his current name of art, West has been expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "ye" is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "t," said West at the beginning of this year, talking about the title of his album with Radion Big Boy.
"For me I am you, I am us, we are us.
I went from Kane, which means "only", just "Yes", which is the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of what we are."
He is one of many prominent figures who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-rapporteur, JAY-Z, has done as he has done with or without a separate visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO is ordered not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has announced that he will never use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching 50 years of a decent representation against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that "I will never use the army to force the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military bodies opened fire on the peaceful exhibitors in the shop, killing 300 of them at a time when the students' left movements were heading across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is driven to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grant to students and opening more public universities without pay.
It has been said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education push young people to criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending for research in this field, the investor and expert of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, says.
Comments have come after various parts of the U.S. government have published artificial intelligence discoveries, although the US lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: in 2030, it aims to voice the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"The release of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, since other countries are still very behind the US and we are looking for a major discovery of the series in this field," Lee said.
The delay of funding may double the chances that the major achievement of the series in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the United States, Lee said in an interview for CBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order", published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Synoving Ventures, who has invested in one of the most specialized companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In 1980, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed by the leading American players in Othello, and later worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as the president of the Google team in China.
Lee welcomed the US government's previous competitions for technology, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Field, and asked when the series would develop competition, in order to help identify new viewers.
Lee said that often, U.S. refugees need to work hard to get loans from the government.
"It's not China that's leaving academic leaders; they're corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked hard at universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can help the US to intensify its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think old cards should automatically be given to people with the doctor's title in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council launched the Plan for the Development of the New Artificial Intelligence Generation.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding for persons in academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is expected to include partners from industry and the Academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a initiative called "AI Next".
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million annually for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the American legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum to change the country's names
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide whether its name would be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a movement that could resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of its northern neighbours includes a claim on its territory, and has decided to block its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change may compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a polling campaign has raised doubts if the election will reach 50 per cent of the necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question in the referendum vote is read: "Are you for NATO and the EU through the accession of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, is a price that is worth being paid to achieve membership in the EU- as well as NATO structure.
"I am here today to vote for the country's future, for Macedonia's young people, that they may live free under the European Union's threshold, since this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no mandatory power, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have expressed that they will include the result of the vote to make that decision.
The name resolution requires a majority of the two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, where 66 per cent of the recorded voters cast their vote.
"If I vote for my children, we have the place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, voting in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on the change in the name of Macedonia, which would open the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was setting up a career in front of the halls raised by the referendum voters.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top head, not entering the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us named Macedonia, we can turn to other states like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring enough investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think the majority of ambassadors will be pro, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would "confirm our future".
According to a published survey by the Macedonian Political Research Institute last Monday, about 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the required level of participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote pro.
For a successful referendum, the rate of participation should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would give them the first strong attack on the pro-west government's policy since its arrival in power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all Bridgeton's protection to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of all Bridgeton's defense at Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday, at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his throat in the 65s to look extremely easy.
Argentina’s governor took a lead in the dispute at the beginning of the action.
He shot through the three Brighton defenders before he went out in the open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four yellow blouses.
He crossed a defense and crossed into a hurry of others at the entrance of the Brighton area.
He followed me on the left where Sterling is.
The English poet used his exit in the area to follow the Agueros summit, which hit the south and crossed the gate of Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball into the right corner of the network.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," said the city manager, Pep Guardiola.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were happy that he marked the dust at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the pets the initial advantage in the Premier League struggle.
This hole was marked in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the summit in half of Brighton's territory.
He had a beautiful vertical for Laroy Sane on the left side.
Sane advanced some steps before she went straight to Sterling in the second pillar.
The horseman brought the ball into the net and then threw it out of the limit lines.
The city will meet Hoffeneheim in the critical challenge for the Campion Law groups on Thursday, 12:55 p.m. in Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to preserve the role of the "plighter" against Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the chance to reach the perpetrators, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to sign against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is the possibility of playoff for Rockies, which have an advantage with a fight against Los Angeles Dodgers in the National Law of God.
Rockies reached at least one chance for the 5-2 winners of the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to get the title of the division.
"Although we are playing without any motive, at least we can note by knowing the atmosphere of the typhoes here in Denver but the fact that the opposition team will play at the highest level against which we can face all year round.
Why didn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the title of Sunday, but it is reported that they are aware that in such situations they let Scherzer begin the meeting.
Scherzer, for which the 34th presentation as the title, led a training session on Thursday and could be held on Sunday, which could be a normal day of rest for him.
A player from Washington, who played with the right is 18-7 with an ERA 2,53 ERA and 300 "drikeouts" in 220 2/3 of the games this season.
Trump gathers West Virginia to meet
The President referred to the terror in relation to his election to the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh, before he spoke about the importance of participating republicans in the upcoming elections.
"Natural is decisive for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks are part of one of the most important choices in life.
That's one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible group of radical democratics, you see what's going on right now.
And they have divided their minds into sects, and you see their foolishness.
They don't want to know who they're hurting, who they're pushing to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to make "block resistance".
"You have seen this in the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "anonymous, wicked, foolish and faithless."
He was referred to as the democratic Chrysennator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, which led to the disillusionment of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you open the document?
Well, well, what?
No, well, no, I... wait a minute-- her body language was pretty bad--it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Job Party is no longer a "open church".
She's non-tolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for the motion of disbelief against me, they didn't even live that way.
Finally, I am not the first of the members of the Labour Party to be told that they are not welcome - all of this because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, just because he strongly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, with regard to national security and with Europe, issues similar to those that Jeremy faced with previous leaders.
In a report on the Meeting of the Working Party in Nottingham East, it was said "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For the vast majority of my eight-year period as local members of the Labour Party, GC meetings have been together as well.
Unfortunately, the meetings have not had their previous tone, and the promise of a "lower and more sensitive" policy has been forgotten ever since, if there has ever been.
It has become increasingly apparent that opposition opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party's leader.
This began a while after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought that I shared similar political views began to claim that I took a 180 degree turn and held positions with which I would never compromise - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
As often as I talk to the public - regardless of what criticisms in social media, with people asking for my discharge, denouncing the policy of the center, they tell me that I should not be part of the Employment Party.
And that's not just me.
I am aware that I am happier than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with gender and racial discrimination every day, but not you.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party should feed a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a "open church", and with every faith movement and with every change in election rules, the party becomes more and more closed.
In the last two years, they have often advised me to lower my head, not to be so famous, and so everything "will go well."
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Since I joined the Work Party 32 years ago as a school student, urged by the failure of the Thatcher government that led to my class failure in a general school, I have tried to work for better public services for those who need more -- either as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clear views of my political positions and points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will touch our families, businesses and public services.
But in fact, the only message I want to continue is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud that I am in your service and I promise you that no threat to discharge or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Age 38 - 17 Melrose: A father who is incapacitated heads the list
Two recent attempts may have changed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to be a triumph in the extremely happy battle of Tenant's Premiership today.
Now they're starting the list as the only inadequate team among ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful protection and courage to take risks for the one who provided the local team victory, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still incapable, because I'm usually happy," he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie said, "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took more risks than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, returned to the ground by Frazier Climo, passed the Ayr in advantage, but a green card for Scottish actor Rory Hughes, who came to this challenge from Warriors, allowed Melrose to show the digital superiority and Jason Baggot received an unencumbered top.
Climo increased Air's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first part, he noted and returned to the ground an individual action by bringing the result to 17-5 for Air before rest.
But Melrose started off well with Patrick Anderson's second and attempt, returned from Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, there was a long intervention as a result of the serious damage of Ruardi Knott, who left the bar, and after the refurbishment of the game, Ayr grew the result through an attempt by Stafford McDowell, noted by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was later punished with foreign cards, and Melrose again used the fact that they had a more player, with a minor attempt at the top of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-pressure part.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with green cards because he punctuated Climo, without top, from the source of the prison, MacPherson made "touch down", after the Air's step of the bow ahead.
Climo noted and did the same almost after refurbishment of the game, after Kyle Rowe caught the team hit by David Armstrong in the area and led the striker (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
Still Game star seems determined for the new career in the restaurant industry
The "Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry, after discovering that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant firm.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis played a role in the famous BBC show, with a co-organist and co-protagonist partner in the comedy world, Greg Hempill.
The boy has announced that the ninth season will be the last time for this show, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of the Border Operations.
The actor refused to comment on history, even though a source for Scottish Sun was left to realize that Kiernan was trying to enter the Glasgow restaurant industry.
"The Sea is ours": Bolivia without going to the sea hopes the court to open its way to the Peace
Marines monitor an improvisation of the sea fleet cell in La Paz.
The public buildings have raised the green flower blue ocean.
On the coastal bases of Lake Titicaca in Amazon, the motor is noted: "The sea is our property.
His recovery is a duty."
Through Bolivia without going out in the sea, the memory of the capture of the coast from Chile in a critical conflict for sources during the 19th century is still quite alive -- as well as the desire to move once again across the Pacific.
Now, these hopes are far greater than they have been ever since, while since October 1st, Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterised by hunger, the spirit of unity and peace, and certainly, awaiting the outcome positively," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the GJND session in large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that - after decades of regular discussions - Chile has been forced to develop talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory with a rise in the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic Indian president, who is facing a controversial battle for the second mandate in the next year’s elections, the decision of May is quite important.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he cried at the end of the summer.
But some analysts think that there is a lot of chance that the courts have decided in favor of Bolivia - and that even if they have, they will change even a little.
The UN celebrity organ in the Netherlands does not have the chance to give another state part of Chile's territory, and it has been said that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is making a decision only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "it wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, an international lawyer's Chilean expert.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the last four years may have punished it.
"The issue of sea access is compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive retort has lost every trace of the remaining charity of the Kilians, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks, but it will be extremely difficult to develop discussions afterwards.
Two countries have not been embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, opposed the idea that the decision of the court was surprising.
The day of May will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of communication with Kilin" and a chance "to end 139-year-old disputes, with benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — was using the maritime issue for political interest.
"Bolivia will never leave her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to understand that we should leave it behind behind the past. "
North Korea says the nuclear czar will not be done for as long as she can't trust US
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Reyong Ho, says his people won't take the first shot at nuclear weapons for as long as they can't believe Washington.
New was holding a talk on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be in the forefront of the re-establishment of nuclear diplomacy so far "sustained", three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un in North Korea.
According to Rei, the hope that the continued sanctions and opposition of the US to the declaration on the end of the Korean War will make North Korea a disintegrated, is a long hope.
As long as Pyongyang does not take the first step in making important movements, Washington refuses to accept the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second round.
There is, however, a broad skepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to withdraw his reasoning, which the state sees as very likely as the only way to guarantee his security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion exhibitions in Paris reveal the latest line of giant ships that will soon come in your city's streets
If you want to own your collection of ships or provide full protection from the sun’s rays, do not seek it again.
The Valentino and Thom Browne stylists presented a series of amazing giant capelashes for their SS19 collection on the streets, which opened up all the stylists in the fashion Week in Paris.
Your infamous hats have taken part in Instagram this summer, and these styles have brought their fascinating creations to the fore.
Valentino’s special creation was a masterpiece of extravagance, decorated with a wide range of details similar to the dolls, which surrounded the head of the model.
Other major accessories included stone-burned chalks, a magic hat, and even a pineapple -- but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a remarkable choice of masks - together at the time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had to be rubbed and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than hair cutter.
One creature resembled the smelling, filled with the sound of the air and the eyes of the water, while another looked like a golden eagle.
And if you like to follow this courageous course, you will be happy.
The fashion analysts predict that giant ships can soon come to your city’s streets.
The giant captain's trend has followed that of "La Bomba", the captain's hat with the two broad legs we've seen all, starting from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The gold mark hidden behind your infamous hat taken through the social media brought another great creature into the passport - a pile of sand from it, almost as big as the model of the bathroom that was holding it.
The tinted orange-colored orange taped with a thin raffle and a hand of white leather on top was the most special creation of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus in the Modora Week in Paris.
The famous personality stylist Luke Armitage pointed out to the F.J.: "The next spring I predict to see the capture and giant plaza in the streets of cities - since the stylist has left such much impact as it would have been difficult to ignore the demands for large accessories."
John Edward: Basic Language Skills for Global Citizens · Global Voices
Private schools in Scotland hold record for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent results in trials, further strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS), are trying to offer the highest level of service for their students and parents.
Private schools intend to prepare their students for further higher levels of education, for their selected career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can map and implement an appropriate educational curriculum, we are witnessing how the voice of modern languages continues to be a widespread and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your words go into his ears.
If you speak to him in your own language, his words are in your heart."
These words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to make contact with people from other lands.
As a result of recent tests this year, we can find that languages are starting the results list, with the highest level of passing notes between private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have received maximum A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received maximum A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received footnote A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the life skills that will be needed without children and young people in the future.
Currently, foreign language debt is considered to be as important as STEM domains (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and later schools.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main challenges faced by workers in developing countries, 17 per cent of them were related to the lack of language skills.
In turn, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young ones for their future careers.
With the support of countries of work that have the capacity to master foreign languages, these skills are fundamental in a globalized world.
Despite the career of choosing a person, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as the master of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with strangers will automatically place a multilingual person on competitors.
According to a YeGov survey, which included over 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language enough to develop a conversation, and French was the only foreign language I spoke from a 2 percent of people, specifically 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is important to children today.
The mastering of many languages, especially the mastering of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of working.
In Scotland, each school will be different for the languages in which it is taught.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be a variety of languages that you can choose from in private schools, with a pedagogical staff composed of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "arm" them with the necessary skills to survive, regardless of the future.
At these times it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the country’s future, so that should be reflected in learning.
Modern languages must truly be considered as "the speed of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.

LeBron is expected to start with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for the fans who were waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-session on Sunday against Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
However, he still doesn't know how much minutes he'll play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
Lakers' correspondent wrote on Twitter that, with a lot of luck, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James asked about his plans for Lakers' six pre-session games.
"I don't need fights before the season at this stage of my career to prepare for it," he said.
Time of Trump's Towers in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launched a series of electric tunnels tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of the five planned to keep them next week, including stops in the friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval left to vote for his election to complete the election in the High Court, Trump intends to create support for future elections as the Republicans risk losing control at Congress when voting in November.
In what hour is Trump's pipeline developing today in Western Virginia, and how do we track it online?
The Trump pipe in Wheeling, Western Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. The Lindore time tonight, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the Trump pipeline in West Virginia online below, via direct transmission to YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address this week's hearing sessions in the Supreme Court of candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was stressed because of his sexual misconduct charges, with the expected vote of confirmation by the Senate to remain silent for a week while the FBI is conducting the investigation of the case.
But the primary aim of these many councils is to help the Republicans take a step forward in the elections of November.
As a result, President Trump's campaign stage said that these five summits in the coming week are aimed at "give energy to volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and educate the majority who hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The Congress's control is so important to its agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible as we direct the campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not want to be identified, said to Reuters.
The planned development in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News news agency.
The week will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits Western Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate's Republican candidate for Western Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has remained behind according to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a scholarship in the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Kupa Ryder 2018: US team showed readiness to fight while maintaining the living hope by directing the garages by Sunday
After three single seasons, the remaining four for the afternoon of the day, could be what this Cup Ryder needed.
It's a totally created sports concept, but a concept where players really believe and never more than in such a race.
So where can we say that this worm feels now?
"They had a six-point leap that has now gone into four, so we can say that it has been created until some sort of worm I believe," Jordan Spieth said while closing the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points ahead, when it remains in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope that the birds are in their favour and have many things to encourage, especially the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day when they took three of the four possible points.
It has been cruel from the beginning of the tears to the grave, and it is being guided by his example.
The party’s brochures were added as he passed the round, entering the golf course with an easy hit to bring him to the match, when he and Thomas were two points below the two rounds.
His simple strategy given them the win in group 15 was expected with a similar brochure, which shows that he believes that the American team is not yet out of line.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your fight," Spieth said.
All players left now.
18 trophies to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisclosed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but devout European has accomplished four of the four and cannot escape.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't get a smile on the minimum afternoon of the week, but they also avoided the noises on the minimum and Sunday morning, Friday evening and nine Sundays Friday morning.
This results and how their energy seems to fall towards the enthusiastic crowd and anacels reinforces the idea that they are players in order to be able to do the day-to-day and that there will be no other player known as Fleetwood and Molinari to defeat a possible European winner, while the sun lies on "Le Golf National".
Maybe two at the same time in different groups.
However, the declarations for a European triumph are still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy for Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-morning games, when he married Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two seconds below set the Spanish and Swedish into a group where they had no chance to leave.
However, on Sunday no one will be there to help you get out of your group.
The four-and-a-two games are so amazing to follow from close to because of the interaction between the two, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead up to the end, but these four sessions have also shown that the US team will still fight even though some people, especially the state, have raised this issue.
Europe heads 10-6 as it goes to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a fundamental advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup since it has emerged from four and two games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Spiritists Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty to increase their advantage at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, offered to get the trophies lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the weak American team in the day-to-day battle, bringing it to the 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance to the four games, winning two battles, but they could not minimize the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual Sunday matches to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first first European player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, the superintendent 'Molliwood', after a sensory end, are the second two in the history of the Ryder Cup that win four points in four of their open battles.
After sending Woods and Patrick Reed to the fourth game, they combined themselves quite well together to enable a weak Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with even more dramatic performance 57-4.
Woods, who had difficulty developing two meetings on Saturday, showed tremendous continuous bursts, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the four and two games and seven each.
Justin Rose, retired for the fourth morning battle, returned to Henry Stanson’s partner in the double game and received a loss of 2&1 from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - held in the first and third world.
Europe had nothing in favor of a beautiful and fresh day in the south of Paris.
Three times professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas decided the difference between Americans and two points on Saturday.
They took a courageous victory 2&1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four wars and later returned to enable Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the two battle after they lost in the first two groups.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team has returned the result after a difference between four points in individual games, although Fury's team needs only a comparison to keep the trophies.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a day - long opposition seems to go beyond their potential.
North Korea says they won't get 'no way' in a way that won't win the faith
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that sanctions continued on Saturday, were deepening the U.S. crisis, and the country would not give up in any way from its nuclear weapons in uniform under such circumstances.
New Yong Ho told the annual body from all over the General Assembly that North Korea has undertaken "the important mass that demonstrates good will" last year, for example, to stop nuclear tests and rockets, to measure areas where nuclear tests were developed and to contend that it will not increase the reason for weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any answers about this from the United States," he said.
"Without faith in the United States, our national security will not be self-sustained, and in these circumstances there is no way we can just blame ourselves."
As Re expresses the usual complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance for a separate phase for the nuclear warming process in which North Korea would be valued for its gradual steps, its declaration seemed important because it did not exclude the single nuclear tsunami, as had previously been done by the Northern Korea.
The new was referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a meeting held for the first time between an American mandate president and Korean-Verior leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim volunteered to work on the "Currency of the Korean Gadi Island" while Trump was voting for security guarantee of North Korea.
North Korea has sought an official end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pennsylvania should first be removed from nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to launch international border sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that the 'nuclear quadrant' be initially carried out and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a decent way, even countering 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can offend us is dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions is putting our disbelief at stake."
The new did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement that the US leader stressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister attended three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If it were the issue of nuclear warming, South Korea would be and not the US, the nuclear warming process would not have come into this situation without the road."
Nevertheless, the tone used in the New Speech was quite different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly, that the US territory's determination under mark with Korean-Veriary rockets was decisive since "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim thanked for the border shown in taking steps to freeze, but said there is still much work to do and that sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea carries out nuclear tsunamis.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three or five months -- that doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penny for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue strongly and without stopping until we complete and final verification of nuclear destruction."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the financing of Penny's nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Rei on Monday at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pennsylvania again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go so well.
He left Spain in July saying he had made progress, and within a few hours North Korea demanded that he had done "the mafios style search."
North Korea participated in a meeting with Moon this month to mark a radical area as well as a nuclear complex if the United States would take "exact measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "excellent measures" he requested were security guarantees for which Trump was in Singapore and movement towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to breathe more, in an effort to combat the culture of the 'machos' study through the use of caffeine from these 'payments'.
One academic observed that university students number one in the world, often do not know when it comes to basics than how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Grave, prepared the course of lessons that he believes is the first of these in the United States.
He was inspired to take this course after giving a reference to the effect that sleep has on the student.
"At the end of these days a little girl came to me, and she said to me, 'Why do you say this to me now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had spoken to her before about the importance of sleep-- which convinced me," he said about The Telegraph.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university's medical services, said the university decided to present this course after finding out that students were seriously deprived of their sleep for a week.
The course of an hour involves a number of responsibilities.
On the other hand, there is a vision of a convict room, where students click on the flickers of coffee, vegetables, athletes and books so that they can explain the effects of coffee and smoking and how the athletic performance of sleeplessness, as well as the importance of the time routine that should pass in bed.
On the other hand, participants are explained as a view of sleep in a period of time to increase the risk of heart attack, ischaemic, depression, and cancer.
A field map, with moving icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that students' contributions will not change immediately.
But we believe they're right to know -- as you're right to know, the health impact when you choose to drink is due," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride that you spend 'a pay night' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and constant pressure on students, meant that dreaming was a constant and growing problem.
The assurance that you have taken enough to sleep, of a good quality, must be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, sleep and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight loss, because the vision of sleep leads the brain into a cold mode, making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old California student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, after having shared in one of his hours of education last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to return to a course for the whole field.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all students of post-university studies to complete a similar programme before competing institutions join them.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students set an hour in summer that when they have to go to bed, also when they have to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue-right' coming out of electronic screens and LED scans, which can lead to the biological rhythm of sleep out of work, which leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga hints against Gerrard's boys
Rangers took another hit as a visitor while Dolly Menga's strike gave Steven Gerard's missing 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was trying to record his first victory from the triumph of the month of February 4.1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second loss in 18 Gerrard matches as a trainer, leaving his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership, team Hearts.
Menga noted seven minutes before completing the first part and with a decision of the Ranger team that seemed totally powerless to compare.
While Rangers now falls to the sixth place, Livingston ascends to the third and is right after the Hibernian for goolash difference.
Rangers may expect to have more tension after their next player Calum Spence was treated for a head attack after hit by an object with a passing away by the visiting typhoes.
Gerard led eight changes in his team, which passed Air in half of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, entered the same 11th field that hit a Hearts point last week and that he would be pleased with how his well-organized team killed the opponents in every round.
Rangers may have been dominated by keeping the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in his possession.
They should have noted only two minutes from the beginning of the meeting, when the first follow-up that Menga gave to Scott Pittman at the gate protected by Allan McGregor wasn't used exactly by him by shooting the ball outside.
A long cross from the beating by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just cried out at the back of the door.
Rangers took control of the game but seemed to expect more than they really believed in their game in the opposite area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a jail sentence after hours of play while he and Steven Lawless were beaten, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian complaints.
Rangers arrived at two hits at the gate in the first part, but Ibrox's former porter, Liam Kelly, was not concerned about Lassana Coulibally's head hit and Ovie Eëria's unforced hit.
While Liv's first gondola in the 34th minute may have been against what was seen in the field, no one can deny that they deserved only the pride they showed.
Sirs Rangers failed to serve long periods for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the summit to Scott Robinson, who kept peace to pass through Menga and to mark it in a simple way.
Gerard worked at rest among the parties as Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent and this change for a while did not give an immediate effect while the anchor followed down to Morelos, but blessed Kelly fled from his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make guests play as they wanted, where Lithgow and Halket followed each other a long time later.
The Holt team may have extended his leadership to the final stage, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow jumped out of a cave caught by the fall.

German: Geiger Master's Spokesman
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, As today 136 years ago and IN AVAZHDIM... the day the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a technique that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geiger measurement.
A major science stylus since then, Geiger's master has also become the main stylus of popular culture, as in the 1950's "Cronado City," with a box of non-professional scientists like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger scale used to track radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you set these limits, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released from radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans, "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the explanation that keeps his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system "distribute" evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "distribute" evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
Method includes the removal of immune cells from a patient, changing them to a laboratory
They can "drive" a protein found in many types of cancer and then re-inject
A vaccine that is under trial is showing promising results in patients with certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells observed that cancer in the womb had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can ‘remove’ a protein that is found to be serious in some types of HER2 cancer, and then reinjecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results tell us we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "invits the growth of some types of cancer," including the cancer of the liver, the kidneys, the kidneys and the liver, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar phase of the release of immune cells from patients "to learn" that how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kane West appeared in a Pro-Trup tube, holding a capel with MAGA's signature, after its SNL display.
You don't have to.
Kanye West launched a protest in the studio during a broadcast on "Saturday Night Live", after a discouraging interpretation where he praised American President Donald Trump and said he would apply for this post in 2020.
After he interpreted his third song for the night "Ghost Town", where he was holding a cape that wrote "Make America Great", he came to speak with our strong opposition to Democrats and renewed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person and they say to me, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have been away from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began its presentation with a parish on the role of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star came to play the witness of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate's Judicial Commission on the charges of sexual assault raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not transmitted, Western harsh speech records were loaded on social networks by Commissioner Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to play with the West with that post or not.
Also, West complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the backyard because of what he had set in his head.
"They hurt me in the back.
They said to me, "Get out of the stage with that hat in your head."
They hurt me!
And then they tell me I'm buried," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
"Do you want to see the founder?" he said, "I put my hat on my head, because this shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments were received at least twice by the viewers and SNL members seemed to feel embarrassed, reports Variety, where a person told the newspaper: "All studies were closed."
West was called a late substitute instead of Ariana Grande, the former lover of whom, Reper Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days earlier.
West surprised many people with the interpretation of "I Love it", dressed as the Perrier shirt.
West was supported by the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the most perturbed souls: FALEMINDERIT OF THE BALLE TURMUS."
But the media moderator Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that the West just "is alone and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose MOS to reward someone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his "art"), for whom I believe to be ashamed and who spreads the ideology that is harmful to my community.
While he's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the last thing I knew as Kane West."
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Didy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His repertoire, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and also the legend of later music Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.

Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, approved toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a savior in the character of Jon Snow, in violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But 31-year-old actor has hit the male hero's stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys realize that they should behave as hard to respect.
Speaking about 'The Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believes that something's gone wrong' and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo's movement.
Kit, who recently married his acting colleague at "Game of Thrones", also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt 'too important' to solve this issue.
'I personally feel quite important about the moment -- where have we been wrong with displaying masculinity?' he said.
'What have we learned from men as they grow, about the problems we are facing now?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing the toxic masculinity due to the extreme male characteristics shown there.
He continued, 'What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, making young boys believe that they should act in a certain way to make men feel?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
For there is verily a disannulling of the righteous one.
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer be jealous of "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of the next summer, saying "the peace and the horses have come to the top of the foot."
From November, Kit will participate in a 'True West' rescan scene by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother mad.
The actor finally showed that meeting with his wife, Rose, is the best thing he's got from "Game of Thrones".
'In this product I found the woman, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sensitive interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic-scientific series of winning 'Emmy' prizes.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 hits across the country, health authorities say.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who take the HIV virus in this way said it had gone zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Greek province.
A year later, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China was increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was de-criminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people still prevails.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men having sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inadequate protective measures during these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal speed in medical barriers to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the data of the GOP senators are shared by the staff members, saying these are "risk messages" and "conspirative theory"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters claimed on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three American senators on the websites of lawmakers in Wikipedia.
Democracy by Los Angeles reported that these claims were being expressed by experts and online pages "the right extreme".
"A lie, a lie and only an innocent lie," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information is reported to include the address of the home and the phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information was displayed online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a hearing session of the Senate panel for the wrong sexual behavior against the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came shortly after the three senators were asked by Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages such as 'Gateway Pundit' and 'RedState' reported that IP addresses identifying the source of publications were linked to the Waters office and took data from a member of the Waters station, reports Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely false and a big lie," said Waters.
"My staff member - identity, personal information and security that has been compromised as a result of these false and malicious claims - has been in no way responsible for the collapse of this information.
This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' declaration immediately faced online criticism, including former Secretary for the Press of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This has not been done in a frustrating way," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that she does not have the right temperature to be a Congress Member.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he doesn't have to be nervous.
It doesn't have to be a provocation.
The accused's motives should not be settled in the matter.
He must be peaceful and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of having shown himself nervous during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take the Waters country to the polls in the middle of the mandate, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"It's great, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her Waters statement, her office has signaled "departmental authorities and law enforcement institutions on these false charges.
"We will ensure that the authors find out," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have devastating and dangerous effects on everyone from my station."
Review of the film "Johnny English Comes Again" - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
It is the event that in every new film with British influence, it is seen for hidden messages on Brexit's theme and this is implemented and on the re-enterprising stage of the comedy-action "Johnny English" - which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and with the return in 2011 with Johnny English's "Retirement".
Will this satellite come up with a clear lack of new national export opportunities?
In any case, the character of the country's outside face, with the face of the dust and in view of Johnny English's succession, has been authorized to confuse things for a second time -- his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a broad-based chemical creature for territories that don't speak English, but that frequent Chinese.
Of course he's a little secret agent, who despite the surprising claims to appear as a magician, has some of Inspector Clouseau's character, some of Mr. Bean's character, and a portion of the guy who only contributed to the release of a sound in the ‘Chariots of Fire’ song, in the open ceremony of the Olympic Games - London 2012.
He is also based on a man of mystery, traveler and international atkinson, who once played on television ads that are now forgotten by Barclaycard, leaving the place in chaos wherever he went.
There's one or two fun moments at the top of this movie.
I liked her very much when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a middle parsmor and the helicopter’s speech was somewhat spread into his helmet.
Here is the generosity of the physical comedian that Atkinson did, but humor seems to be empty and sometimes too much, especially when the 'serious' movies like 007 and the 'Minister Mission' have even entered a few comedians as ingredients in their films.
Humor seems to be directed to children more than the age and critical events of Johnny English are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as those of Atkinson in Bean's character.
The permanent theme as well as this film is the fact that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cybernetic hacker has been infiltrated on the UK agents' super-secret network, revealing the identity of British field agents and has left the agent in charge -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who looks like a pupistic and ready to fight, who is already suffering an extraordinary political non-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing better to realize the character that looks like Teresa May, but there's not much text on the scene that he can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy is compromised, so she'll have to rely on someone who's retired.
And that means choosing yourself Johnny English, who was now working as a school director on a high school floor, but who was not really teaching you how to become a secret agent: there's a nice scene here, because English is offering a spinal academia in the form of rock school.
English calls again in Whitehall for an urgent meeting and is rewarded by his ex-introvert Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, associated with a captain of descent, in the role of a high school girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has been used a little wrong for this role.
So Batman and Robin did the whole thing back in Her Majesty's Secret Service, they're back in action, fighting with the beautiful fetish woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being surprised by the billions of attractive technologies that claim to be able to solve the problems of British computers: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their fun and fun: masked as cameramen, they set up a beautiful French restaurant; they cause chaos as they enter the luxury exit of Volt; and English is completely confused as they try to use the material of Virtual Reality to identify themselves with the inner parts of the Volta's house.
All sequences are usually done for the final stage, but regardless of the joy and excitement, everything looks like a little movie for the children.
It's pretty moderate.
And as in other Johnny English films, I couldn't imagine, isn't the British film industry a role for Rowan Atkinson that would suit his talent?
The Laburist Party believes that there is a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to pay for five days
The Laburist party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week -- but pay for five.
The party reports that the company's bosses would like to withdraw by using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for employees, giving them an extra day of rest.
We would see that the workers would enjoy a weekend with three days of rest, but they kept on walking home in the same street.
The sources said the idea would be "inspired" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a favor for employees.
The transition in a week with four days of work is an idea that has been captured by the Syndicate Congress, as a way the workers benefited from the change in the economy.
A high-level source of the Laburist Party said 'The Sunday Times': 'Before the end of the year a policy change is expected to be announced.
'It is not about to happen immediately, but a week with four working days is an ambition that corresponds to the party's failure to balance the economy in favour of employees as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.'
The Laburist Party would not be the first to sum up this idea, where and the Gelber Party has been robbed for a week and four days working during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition is not currently being replaced by the entire Laburist Party.
One member of the Laburist Party said, "A week with four days' work is not party politics, and it's not getting a chance from the party."
The Chancellor in Hiye, John McDonnell, used the last week's Laburist party conference to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to pass the power on by the ‘anonymists’ and ‘users’ to public service firms.
Chancellor plans in winter also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take all their shares back, because the Laburist government can lead to 'increasing' the reason for the actions considered to be a failure.
He also confirmed plans to set up employees on company boards and to create the Property Entrepreneurship Fund to pass 10 per cent of the private sector's capital, which would mean an annual dividend paid up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shows in "60 Minutes", if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation on charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appeal to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions if the findings of the investigation bureau could affect a republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast Sunday, the emission correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his college from South Carolina.
"I'll tell you, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I went to the hearing session, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got her on the phone after this happened, so when the charges came up and I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined and clear."
However, Graham’s voice appeared as if he were lying on a rock.
"I've divided the mind of Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make some bomb charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejected it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"That whoever she mentioned could not verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival" and has done anything to put poverty in its place?
This week, New York will host the "Global Citizen" Festival, an annual musical show that contains a large and beautiful list of stars that interpret and also have a mission that is so blessed; they end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the "Global Citizen" Festival will wait for thousands of people at the "Great Law" in the Central Park not only to enjoy the interpretations of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be conscious of the real purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international law group, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight actively against it.
In order to benefit from a ticket of gratitude for the show (except when you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must meet a number of obligations, or "activities" as voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness of their achievement of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when they've stayed and 12 years to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of people's reward with a concert really work to convince those who ask for this intervention, or is it just another case of what is known as "click activation" - people who feel that they are making a real change by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has been said to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, giving them a boost to different objectives.
It is said that these actions have helped global leaders to declare political commitments worth $37 billion, which is said to affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 claims and declarations as a result of the group's activities, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main prizes include "The Power of Nutrition", a partner of investors and implementing agencies centrally in the United Kingdom, committed to "encourage children to grow with their full potential," promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the corruption in this country, after receiving more than 4700 "circulations" from Global Citizen activists.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social injustice into a memory of the past," the ambassador's team "The Power of Nutrition" told him at a live concert in London, April 2018.
The group also said that after establishing 5000 actions to call the United Kingdom to improve food for mothers of children, the government declared funding a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In a most common answer to their online questions, what makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fail.
But as every high citizen's right and as the movement against the apartheid in front of us, we're going to go out, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are some of the actors who will interpret this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the sea for "blockage" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary" Washington may be supported by his Marine to prevent Russian energy spread across the market, including the Middle East, has revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinke claims that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it is operating at the request of the Syrian government — is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to provide it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern coast of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there's a way to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Marine, to ensure that the coastal roads are open and, if necessary, to block them, so as to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was directed to participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a charitable organization that has identified itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's cuts in the treatment with Iran's Russia, recognizing that these cuts are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is a little of the use and replacement of the fuel lakes," he said, referring to Russia as "a false moon" with an economy that depends on fossil fuel lakes.
The declarations come after the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase exports of natural gas frozen to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much more open option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 journal project, which according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow "slave".
Moscow has continued to say that the 11 billion-dollar North Stream 2 project, which is supposed to double the existing media capacity to carry it to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the fire-fighting opposition from Washington is simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the same idea that energy cannot be a device used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to select the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has provoked opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The main industry organisation in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" if she will apply for presidents in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" taking part in the race for president after the elections in the middle of the mandate.
During a tour in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would take the candidate in advance.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and regulate our destroyed government, and this includes the establishment of a woman on top," she said, according to 'The Hill'.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously the candidate for presidents."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during the bombing in the city, saying he's going to take the place in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a petition on Friday, Warren said, "I'm sure we need an investigation from the FBI before the vote."
However, a Thursday survey showed that a large part of Warren’s voters don’t think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not apply, according to surveys conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidate.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for candidates, where 38 per cent supported a possible candidate and 48 per cent opposed to this candidate.
The other high-profile democratic names discussed for the year 2020 include former president, Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would be officially placed in January, reports 'Associated Press'.
Sarah Palin quotes Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder in Donald Trump's tube
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he was called up for military service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged for a violent incident in the family
"What's going on, what's going on, what's going on after he's back, can connect to other families that feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return," she told participants in a tube for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pallin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and others are fighting, "they come a little different, complicated, thinking if they get due respect for what the country has given them."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence after an attack on a woman, after a family violence report and detention while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a police department spokesman in Vasilla.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the Caribbean are supporting a legal opposition to a new American policy that rejects the asylum of victims who have been rescued by criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts deposited a document explaining as a friend-of-the-law document on Friday in Washington, in support of the change in asylum-seekers' policies, reports NCB News.
The full name of the dissident in the Grace case against the session that the United States of Civil Liberties has deposited in August against federal politics has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but US officials denied her request for asylum on 20 July.
She stopped in Texas.
State attorneys who are supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing a high number of asylum applications in the United States because they are countries with problems with gangs and family violence.
A new asylum-search policy in the United States, a decision was made in 2014, by the Emigrant Appeals Board that allowed immigrants without documents to save violence in the family and apply for asylum.
The General Prosecutor of the Caribbean, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "inspires decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require all asylum requests to be judged on the basis of the special facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure will be fought against this principle," said the friend-in-law report.
More lawyers argued in the report that the ban on the entry of immigrants was detrimental to the American economy, saying that their share was to be overworked and to "give the necessary burden of work."
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the judges of immigration in June to refrain from any more victimizing violence in the family and violence from gangs.
"Azili is available for those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious faith, nationality or independence in a designated social group or political consensus," the session said on the day of the political declaration on 11 June.
Azili has never been thought to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- with which people face every day around the world.
Efforts to save Palu while the balance of death is doubled in a race to find survival
To the survivors, the situation was yours.
"The situation is quite tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while holding her little and sick son at a center of evacuation in the lost city of Palus.
"Ambulance brings bodies every minute.
There's no clean water."
The Canaanites saw them return to their destroyed houses, bringing their dead bodies into the water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 walls are damaged.
Some of the victims, including Dwi Haris, who has broken the border and the shell, were placed in the Military Hospital outside Palus, where patients are being treated in the external environment because the earthquakes continue.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled the violent storm in the hotel room on the fifth floor that separated him from his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed under the walls," Haris said 'Associated Press', adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard that the woman was crying and asking for help, but then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'angactim' with 'progandistic advertising'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on an American daily that promoted the joint benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's supplement to the 'Des Moines Register' - the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after he accused China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress's elections held on 6 November, a complaint that is ignored by China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere with US elections indicated what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's campaign to add pressure to China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a top-up trade war that has seen a comparison of tariffs on imports of each other.
Chinese and American experts have said that China's Spanish tariffs in this trade war have been designed to attack exporters in cities like Iowa, which has supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former Governor for a long time in Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American employees, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in 'Des Moines Register' on Monday, Branstad wrote, "China is already doubleing this attack by putting propaganda advertising on our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the American joyful tradition of free speech and free press by setting up a press release in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newspapers on the streets here in Beijing, there will be a lot of voices against and you will not see any real reflection of the different ideas that Chinese may have for China's worrying economic tractor, since the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most special newspapers in China, the offer was rejected to publish his article," although he did not tell him what the newspaper was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are voting women in the middle of the mandate after the Kavanaugh scandal
The more the main characters of the Republicans are to solidarity and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of some claims for sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will face a harsh response mainly from women in future elections within the mandate.
Emotions for this topic have been high, and many republics have publicly declared that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't go away," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the University of Sirakuza 'Scholla Maxwell told 'The Hill' about an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was doubting Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison)'s last minute for an FBI investigation and that this would be enough to calm the angry voters.
" town won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokesman for the progressive group 'MoveOn', says Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang 'Nintori is coming!' as they demonstrated in the Senate corridors while the Republicans who have control of the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidate, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported 'Mic'.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach May," news page Stu Rothenberg, a political independent analyst, told him.
"People are saying that it's already on high levels; that's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the unsubsidised female voters in the perimeter and among the young voters, aged 18 to 29 years, who, even though they don't like the president, usually don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony covering her allegations of sexual assault against the High Court's candidate, analysts suggested that there would be a severe reaction if the Republicans continued to support this candidate.
"It has been transformed into a co-founded defeat for GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of Republicans, at the beginning of last week, according to 'NBC News'.
"It is not only to do with the committee's vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh is to be set or not in the bank and the accused, it also does with the way the Republicans have dealt with this issue and with the way the woman has been treated," said the NBC News, Guy Cecil, director of the USA's Priorities, a group that helps in selecting Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided by those who believe in the warning of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with this latter having a slightly higher support.
A recent survey by 'YouGov' shows that 41 per cent of the pollers believe in the accident or with the possibility of Ford witness, while 35 per cent say they believe in the accident or with the opportunity of Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent think that Kavanaugh, with many possibilities or failure, has lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's insinuations, the FBI is currently investigating the claims presented by Ford as well as the other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reports 'The Guardian'.
Last week, Ford witnessed before the Senate's Judicial Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17, while he was in a state of shock.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genetic organs in front of her while they were at a party during their 80's studies in Yale.
Global Network Creator Plans to launch a new Internet to compete on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Network, is creating a company that aims to revaliate Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open-source platform of Berners-Lee, called ‘Solid’.
'Solid' allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are allowed to have access to a particular information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said about this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create "saving their personal data on the networks" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, list of items to do, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available on a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What's unique about keeping personal data on the network is the fact that the user is completely in the hands of what kind of information it will access.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of the company, John Bruce, is to bring together the necessary sources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently part of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on this project, and a voluntary co-authorised community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the available tools on the Inrupt web page.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google if they have to present or not a total change where all their business models are completely over during the night.
"We're not looking for their permission."
In a post in "Media" published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
During the past months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network independence.
Even as it is based on Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Institute of Hapura Forests.
"I am you optimistic about this new time of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victorian Church during World War I for the Clergy · Global Voices
The only clergyman who won a Victorian Crick during World War I in the quality of the warrior is remembered in his country, 100 years later.
Undercolonel, nobleman Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucour.
However, he was killed by a blacksmith four days later and never received a notice that he had won the highest title in the British army.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandsons in a paradise in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the nipples, Michael Vann, said it was "exactly symbolic" that the memory was exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to 'London Gazette', on September 29, 1918, Under Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the canal of Saint-Quentin "by a heavy storm and under the thickening of bullets from the fields and mitrals."
He then rushed to the fire line and with a "great threat" led the battle forward and caught one of the weapons in the field and killed only three persons from the opposing bodies.
Under Colonel Vann was killed by a German synapses on October 4, 1918 - a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve, but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, decided from a post-paradise corner led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said "it was quite honorable to be part of this parade," and he added that "the value of a real hero is being shown by the support given to many people."
MMA fans stayed all night alert to follow Bellator 206, but instead they saw "Derkuen Pepa"
Imagine, you've stayed up all night awake to see Bellator 206, and then you're taking the chance to see this major event.
The exhibition from San Jose contained 13 doublings, including six doublings in the base package and will show in real time during the night on channel 5, in MB.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, viewers in Britain remained surprised when the transmission changed to show Derkuen Pepa.
Some remained disappointed after having stayed awake all night until the first hour, especially for this struggle.
A fan on Twitter described this passage from the struggle in a video film for children as "a bad joke."
"It is the government rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate for and we should pass on to a programme for children," Dave Schwartz, a substitute marketing and communication representative in Bellator, said when he was asked about the transmission.
"The Pepa's Doll," yes.
The president of Bellator's company, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include and viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," said Coker.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, tomorrow and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our hour, then Monday with their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was started there, there were many messages surrounding them, and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to make the show with five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're gonna be able to give more for the fans, and maybe we're gonna have a little bit of fun.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'lower' about his sexuality
Olympic poet Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality — but this gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to school nine-year-olds that "they were all like me."
Speaking of the first program on Radio 4 'Desert Island Discs,' presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope."
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The permanent presentation of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has been resting for several months because of illness.
Showing himself as a person who was transferred to Laverne's first program, Daley said that during the time he grew up he felt "inferior" to others because "he wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, have been the real elements that gave me strength and strength to keep them."
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they heard of his sexual orientation.
Twice winning the bronze Olympic medal, he is already an activist of the LGBT high profile profile and used his participation in the Communist Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came open because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world's champion said the fall in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "I got unplanned."
Last year, Daley married the winner of the Oscar prize, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When he has so many things in such a new age" -- he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone in the same age who had experienced the same floods.
The couple became parents in June, of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all prospects" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, everything I thought was 'I'd have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son holds the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with cancer in his head.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if we had the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I can't tell 'you can't be in the first row," he said.
"I was holding their hand as he recovered the spirit and only after the rest received the spirit and changed his life for the first time that he was not innocent," he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to shake before the local public in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical selection -- Proud by Heather Small -- that has accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause mornica.
Desert Island Discs is delivered to BBC Radio on Sunday 4 at 11:15, with British hour.
Mickelson, out of shape, left the table on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson would set a record Sunday when he played his 47th fight at Ryder Cup, but he would have to change his shape so that he wouldn't return this historic moment to disappointment.
Mickelson, for which the 12th time he took part in this event, this own record, which is organised every two years, was left at the table by Captain Jim Furyk, during the dissident games (fourballs and Foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has usually been for the United States, five times the winner of the major titles passed the day by supporting the team and working with hope that he would leave behind the concerns.
Not among the players with the fairest hit even when he was at the end of his career, 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complex Le Golf National field, where long and difficult areas did not leave a place for wrong hunting.
And if it wasn't just the fear of the field, Mickelson, Sunday, in the ninth battle will face the "British Open" campaign, Francesco Molinari, which has formed a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win their fourth match this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before the start of the 12 rounds, are going to start with it, the game of Mickelson can be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, though he could not say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a shot of swords, put my hand in my chest and told me it would be tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great faith in himself.
He's at the Famous Hall, and he's made a lot of contributions for these teams in the past week, and this week.
Maybe I didn't think he'd have two fights.
I had thought more, but in the end, it turned out that it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with more presentations in Ryder Cup's matches.
It can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven comparisons, even though Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's greedy, sarcastic, strong, he likes to attack people, and he's a fantastic boy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players were happy to meet him this week, and this was nice to see them.
He gives more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big head can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that the considerable headway ahead of the last day of the games in Ryder Cup can be transformed into a negative factor.
Danez made his debut in the battle of 1997 in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against Americans closing the tournament with a very narrow difference, 141⁄2-131/2.
"It reminds itself that we had a big head in Valderrama; we had a big head in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram where we won but with a lot of difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after no win 5-3 in 'Class 2018' on Friday and tomorrow to run 10-6 in 'Le Golf National'.
So history tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll go with the last March.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's done until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, we're trying to get this trophi, and here's our focus.
I told you all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have in the team, but we're aware of who we're facing -- the best players in the world."
Happy with the performance of his players in a difficult golf field, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this phase.
Tomorrow we'll face another "work".
Tomorrow they see individual performances, and that's something else to do.
It's fantastic when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, you're testing your full potential as a golf player.
This is the message you have to pass to the players tomorrow, you have to give the best by yourself.
Now, forget the partner after he has to go and give him the best of it."
By contrast with Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will expect his players to perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas are doing three of the four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced two cases of major returns of the result on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he lost what is considered "Merculia in Medina" of the European team.
"I remember every word," when he asked how his players had motivated him during the last day of Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
"We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as I saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you take me to one side, you put a lot of pressure on each other in the middle of the struggle.
We've decided the training based on this and we'll get the boys out of the order we believe is best, after you know, we're trying to perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the duty to launch the implementation of the result and will face Rory McIllroy in the main battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players who take the lead in the first half of the settlement
"I chose this group and in this order that I believe it covers all the roads in the struggle," Bjorn said about his next election.
Reproducing the New German Fight
The new German Navy fleet must have been sent in 2014 to replace the wars of the Cold War era, but it will not be until the next year due to the problems and high costs, local media have reported.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main new flagship boat "Baden-Wuertertenberg-class", is silent until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper 'Die Zeit', which quotes a military caller.
Goda has to join Marines in 2014, but the problems after transmission have damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
Four vessels of the type ‘Baden-Wuertertenberg-class’ that were commissioned by the Marine in 2007, will serve as the replacement of the old ‘Bremen-class’ frigates.
The knowledge will include a strong summit, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft and anti-stalth technology, such as a reduction in radiation detection, red and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer periods of maintenance - should be possible for new brakes to be transferred for more than two years from the country’s ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the final technological struggles - which are said to enable Germany to reflect the power of the country - will be old at the time they enter the service, writes the 'God Zeit'.
F125, came to the first pages last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the passport for this ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss's port office in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina turned a ship back to her construction site after her release.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany noted that they were a number of "great-grandmother and hardy failures" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in the programme were particularly important on the Baden-Wuertertenberg-class ships because they will operate from a 120-marine crew - half of the working force of the old Bremen class's class frigates.
It was also discovered that the ship was yours, which reduced its yield and limited marine ability to further improvements in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is believed to be the double of a similar category of ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical features of the problem, the cost of the whole project — including the training of balance - is also becoming a problem.
It's said it's reached a figure that leaves you with no word of $3.1 billion (3.6 billion) - from €2.2 billion that was originally predicted.
The problems encountered by the new fleets become especially important after the latest warnings that German marine power is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament defence committee, admitted that Marines are "killing the proper ships to be transferred to another country."
The officer said that the problem had been added over time because old ships had been removed from use but had not been replaced with new ones.
He mistakenly said none of the new Baden-Wuertertenberg-class frigates would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Watches the Secret of Night’s Squads
A new research being developed by a company in Scotland’s maladies aims to find out how the night’s cooks use the ground to cook food.
It is hoped that new discoveries will shed new light on the conduct of the pilots alone and will help protect them in the future.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night skiers and soprano pipistreles as well as the meat and meat tastes of Daubenton in the Inverwe forests, in Western Ross.
Special registration equipment will be placed on key pads throughout the area to monitor night-care activities throughout the season.
NHS stage and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sounds that will be performed by experts for all records will determine the frequency of the night's sounds and what each species does.
Then a report and a map of their home will be drawn to give a detailed overview of their conduct.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection adviser to NTS, hopes that the conclusions will show which habitats are more important to night hunters and how they are used by each species.
This information would help to determine the benefits of local administration, such as the creation of the coastal islands and the preservation of the forests for night vacationers and other related species.
The number of night walkers in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has increased dramatically over the past century.
They are under threat of construction and development that affects speech and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, such as displaying lifts or chemical components of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic animals.
In fact, the night-timers are not blind.
However, because of their winter habits during the night, their hair is more useful than their eyes when it comes to keeping watch.
They use sophisticated location detection techniques to accurately define insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important plants and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes very seriously with night-care professionals.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular studies, speech inspections, and sometimes include rescue programs.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to the nightly hunters in Threaves, Dumfries, and Galloway, which serves as home to eight out of ten species of night hunters in Scotland.
The reserve administrator, David Thompson, says this country is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrace we have a great area for the night's fishermen," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
But there's still a lot of things about the rest of the night's sleepers that remain unsatisfied, about the work we're doing here and in other places, it's gonna help us understand more about what they need to do to develop them."
He stresses the importance of carrying out night-care checks prior to the completion of property conservation tasks because there is the possibility that the sudden destruction of a speech could kill up to 400 women and young people, thus spreading the whole population of one area.
Nightings are also protected and their murder, assault, and concern, or the destruction of their speech, is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish worker near the Night’s Watch Tower, encourages people to be part of the relief work.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our customers at night and a lot of our species, we just don't know how their people are moving."
Ronaldo rejects the trial as lawyers prepare to dismiss the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo said the charges against him are "false knowledge," saying people "will promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to reject the German news journal Der Spiegel, which published these accusations.
Portuguese and Juventus Sulmer has been charged with the arrest of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later claimed to have paid that $375 000 not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a video live in Instagram, led by 142 million followers, only a few hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33 years old, considered the reports "false teachings."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he told you today, the false news," said before the camera five times the winner of the Art Top.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," added the player laughing.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to dismiss "Der Spiegel" for these charges, which they have called "unpretentious reports of doubts about private life,"
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "the moral values in value that correspond to the seriousness of fraud, which is perhaps one of the most serious obstacles to personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is reported to have occurred in June 2009, in a corner of Palms Hotel and Kazino in Las Vegas.
According to the documents presented at the Clark District Court, Nevada, after meeting at a club at night, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is claimed to have arranged it in the year.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to hell after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he's a "good boy" lying in a ball from "one per cent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple have committed sexual relations but that it was with the presence of both sides.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a decision outside the court because she was "stirred by the arrest" and was concerned that she would "publicly be tortured."
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to get the deal back because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the meeting with Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer passed to Italian juventus giants in an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom ‘will forever repent’ of losing the status of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will be forever repentant" if it will lose the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "an alarming" that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border, in the case of non-contractual exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces the models Toyota Auris and Avenues, sold nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's administrative director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in MB, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced the fear of getting out of the EU without agreement and of how the intercom trade will work.
For example, BMW said Brexit would close her Mini serial factory for a month.
Main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as the risk of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis "now only the passport," with parts coming every 37 minutes from the MB and EU suppliers, for passenger cars.
If, on 29 March, the MB comes out of the EU without an agreement, there may be delay within which this industry can lead to delays and lack of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep her factory in Derbyshire more than a day's inventory, the company said, and to slow down the production I'll stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations "is specifically built to avoid these border controls."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment to also take advantage of this opportunity," he said about the program Today's on BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, show that we should not be able to continue what has been a very successful supplier."
Toyota could not determine how long the production would be stopped, but in the long term, warned that the added costs would undermine the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to reduced jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the top U.S. union officer in the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience when these countries are closed, they are no longer coming back.
One government spokesman said: "We have set a comprehensive and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy General Rod Rosenstein could be "sustained for a week" after the battle continues for the High Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's electoral intervention, ties between Trump's and Russia's aid personnel and the possibility of the president's banning of justice.
The discussion whether Trump will download or not the general prosecutor of the duty, thus endangering Mueller's independence, is something that has been created for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into account the position of a prosecutor to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the president's discharge through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among the reports that he was near the delivery.
As expected, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which took place at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Trump said "you'd prefer" not to download Rosenstein, but after the meeting he added to avoid an appeal with the hearing session held by the Senate's judicial committee, where he was witnessed by Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a similar investigation by the FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh, further stressing the full vote in Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There's not yet a date, it can be this week. I think it can be added a week, having all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But, let's see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences did not result in the disillusionment of television journalists," although she said, "I will not deny the fact that they draw attention."
Later, it will be understood that direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president carries out more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without mentioning the data: "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, then this is much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have often done it over the last few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in the open session or at a press conference with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have given the reason for this fact, during this week in New York, where he made a controversy and in some strange cases, in front of journalists.
Health Secretary wrote workers from the EU, in NHS Scotland, about the fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written EU staff working at NHS in Scotland to express thanks on behalf of the country and the desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, members of the Scottish parliament, has sent a letter, when they have remained less than six months from the EU's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken over to cover the application costs for the status of permanent residence for EU citizens working in public services at local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations for the EU's departure from the EU have continued, approaching an age-old decision.
However, the MB government has also intensified its preparations in the event of an unconstitutional scenario.
I know it's a very stressful time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Members of the EU and in addition bring valuable experience and skills that grow and improve the work of health service, increasing the benefits of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your homelessness, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subject to an emergency surgical intervention after the head injury
Tennesse's state protector Tigers Christion Abercrombie has been subjected to an immediate surgical intervention after the head injury on Saturday, in the loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported The Tennesean newspaper, Mike Organ.
Tennesse State Rod Reed trainer told reporters that the damage occurred shortly before the first part.
"He came to see me suddenly and fell down there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen in the aneurysm before they set it in the barrel and sent it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgical intervention at the Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there's still no details about the nature of the damage," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage happened.
Abercrombie, student of the second year, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He conducted five weekly sessions before leaving the game, bringing it to the total number of sessions during the season.
Foreign citizens will pay higher taxes when buying a property in MB
Foreign nationals will pay higher pay for the purchase of a property in MB and state money will be used to help the innocent in accordance with the new Conservative Party's plans (Tory)
This move will neutralize Corbin's success in attracting new voters
The pay tax will apply to those who don't pay taxes in MB
The treasure department plans to collect up to 120 million GBP per year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay higher pay for the purchase of a property in the MB and cash will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's success initiative to attract new voters with promises to offer more challenging stress and to "hold down" people with high profits.
The pay tax will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in MB, while state money will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of stress.
This extra fee - which is added to the current salary tax, including the increase in the tidal scale presented two years ago for the second house and for the property purchased for rent - can go up to three percent.
Thesari's department predicts that this move will total up to 120 million GBP per year.
About 13 per cent of the last property built in London is purchased by people with a location outside the MB, resulting in price increases and making it more difficult to find savings from the buyers for the first time.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capitals - have turned to "funty cities" because of the high number of foreign-national bloggers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called to reduce the pay tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping their prices high by buying the land but not using it, and made a call to the lady. May to get out of the hills for challenging houses, in order to regulate "the British Tower with property."
Mr Corbyn has proposed some exciting reforms for the strike, including control of the area and removal of "by reason".
He also wants to give more powers to advice on building a new home.
Mr. May said, "Last year I declared that I would devote myself to the mandate of the prime minister of the return of the British dream -- so, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means adjusting the problem of homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the MB and foreign societies to have the easiest to buy home than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has made something too difficult to achieve, and the injustice to the homeless is more real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "largest ambition" is that at a particular stage is to become Scotland's coach.
Scocesz, 42 years old, is experiencing the challenge of raising the northern-lindor club, which is currently located in the third place in League One (the third category), three points away from the head.
He came to the Third Stadium this summer after returning to St. Mirren to the Premier League of Scotland last season.
"I wanted to play for my place as a player.
It was once presented to representative B and just so," Ross declared to BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But, as a child grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this option will only come if I am successful in leading the clubs."
Ross' predecessors in the direction of Sunderland include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alla Athletic's former coach says he's not worried about following the steps of these big names in such a big club, since he's previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my success will depend on the fact that 'I can bring this team back to Premier Law?'
Having represented the structure and environment of this club, we would expect it to be in Premier Law," he said.
"It's not easy for us to go there, but I'd see myself as successful only if I could get the club back to Premier Law."
Ross has only three years of career as a trainer after a period as a trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month period at Heart's leading stage.
Later he helped Alla build a higher category up to the third round of the cup, as well as transformed St. Mirren from a club near the discounting category into the champion's winner's next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he's ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Perhaps it was really a turning point," he says, for taking alla's direction.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I made a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But playing a game can be difficult.
You have to have a lot of things, every week.
Now, I'm experiencing a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right job.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing something like this, and I've never been so good and so alone all my life as an adult."
Full interview you can hear on Sunday, in Sportsound, on September 30, on Radio Scotland from 12:00 till 13:00 BST
According to a study, perfect time "to drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased local incomes in difficult situations in Britain, but it has increased pressure on restaurants.
The data show that sales in local and color groups increased by 2.7 percent in July, but the prices in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who kept track of the data, said: "The constant sun as well as England's participation in the World Cup for the longest time was likely to affect Korea following the same trend as the zero, where local sales increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants registered even higher discounts.
I went to the restaurant with 1.8% in June, and it was even worse in July.
Bars and locals with major activity in the supply of drinks recorded the best performance, with higher increases than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
The main areas of activity of the food supply were also known as the effects of the sun’s weather, even though it is not as significant as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
Bar and local drinking sales increased by 6.6 per cent in that month, while food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, a free time analyst and peer review at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When business comes to the retail market, the motivation and impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales by 4.8 per cent per year will have a particularly heavy burden, considering the constant cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators and time will show if the most moderate dry temperatures will give the most loving calm."
The total increase in sales in local and restaurants, including those on Saturdays, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in market launch.
The Coffer Peach Index of Industrial Sales Tracking, for the color sector and restaurants in MB, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total gross of more than 9 billion GBP, and is a point of industry reference.
One out of five children has secret figures in the social media that are hidden from parents
According to one study, one out of five children, some of whom are under the age of 11, have hidden figures in the social media that are hidden from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed increased in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear of sexually transmitted diseases
Nine percent of the students said they have a "primary" count that shows parents.
One out of five children, some of whom are under the age of 11, are opening up the social media, using adult secretaries.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed rapid increases in "false Insta" profiles - related to the photo dissemination page, Instagram.
This news has raised the fear of pornography.
Nine percent of the students said they use a clean "primary" figure that parents show, but they also have private figures.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, discovered that a teenager urged others to "keep up."
The UK Digital Avarences Study and the Headmasters' Conference of Headmasters and Headmistresses at the HMC conference found that 40 per cent of the group from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had hidden figures.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers hesitate to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" on the Atlantic coast of Scotland.
Elid Doyle has been selected at the Atlantic Coast in Scotland, at the office of the executive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athletes and fields and leader Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elidy enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the MB and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making that part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to serve as an athlete's voice, and I hope I will contribute and help in directing sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 - foot [200 m] and 400 - foot [400 m] race in the 1996 Games, in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and a regular expert in BBC, lost the ability to run after a temporary Islamic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had an attack.
I can't go.
The doctors said that only time will tell him if I'm going to heal and how much.
I had to work hard, but now I was able to recover completely, and I learned to walk again, and today I am doing my own destruction!
Thank you for encouraging messages!"
The propaganda of the giraffe’s bombs that compares mothers to wolves gives public opinion
A company for the production of giraffe pumps has shared public opinion with a commercial that compares mothers who give eggs with eggs.
To launch the promotion of what is considered "the first smoke pump in the world without noise and which can be used," the society of consumer technology products, Elvie, showed a gas music video to advertise the freedom that it gives to new pumps of mothers who need to express freely.
Four real mothers dance in a bar filled with noises under the voice of a song with the following words: "Yes, I wash myself, but I don't even have it" and "If you didn't put it new, these aren't dry, it's my stomach."
"The dust, the dust, the dust, the dust, the dust, the dust, and the flesh."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has led to online debates.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received friendly responses from viewers, with many of them expressing that it is subsidizing the "temple" of the rubber industry.
"The use of bats to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Just like us, they should remain "sustained" and "landin" to produce eggs, only that their "birth" takes from them a few days after the birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's giraffe pump is placed inside the recipes and doesn't fall into the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Frequently traumatic about the mother and the child.
Why don't we use you to advertise a giraffe pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "What kind of unsympathetic advertising."
Others supported the advertising, among which a woman admitted that the song looked "to laugh."
"I think this is a general idea.
I'd have bought one if you still wanted to feed the kid.
The bomb made me feel like a hole.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I saw what it meant.
This is a generic product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a gas advertising directed to mothers who use the pump (often at work or in toilets) and who feel like "loss."
This is not a advertising that appreciates or condemns the rubber industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they've all danced with the "fucking" bomb placed on the tapes.
The concept behind this field is based on the data that many women who use live pumps say they feel that they are hungry.
However, Elvie’s pump is unhesitating, without a bow or a tube, placed inside the loops, and does not fall into the eye, giving women free to move, hold their babies, and even get out while they use them.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD (Creative Executive Director) in Mother commented: "Pompa Elvis is a product as revolutionary as it deserves a courageous and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely, we wanted to take note of the use of the pump and the challenges they are facing, as well as to reflect in a fascinating and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that gives the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump comes out on the first page.
During the week of fashion in London, a mother of two showed up at the Marta Jakubowski stylist parlor using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been forced into hiding in a tent camp at Texas border
The number of prohibited immigrant children has increased even though the number of months of transitions in the border has remained relatively the same, partly as the consequences of the retracing and strict policies presented by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send children back to their support.
Usually, most of the supporters have also been self-immigrants without documents, and have been afraid to risk their position instead of trying to apply for a child.
The crisis grew in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and these data would also pass on to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Agency, witnessed before the Congress that the agency had arrested ten persons who had applied to support the undisputed massacres.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had no previous criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of the individuals supported or members of the support family stand out in an illegal way and a large part of them are foreign to pre-trials.
So, we're still following these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to sleep workers, trying to speed up child data, officials presented new rules that some of them demanded to appear in court within a month from the time of the ban, not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before immigration judges through video conferences and not physically, in order to argue their request for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to sleep workers and reports received from the system in recent months, as long as children remain disabled, it is more likely that they will feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent or attempts to slow them down.
It is said that these concerns are more serious in view of a greater environment such as Tornillo, where, because of size, there is more than one way to distinguish signs that indicate a child has difficulty.
They add that the move of children to the city of Taanach has not given them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends, may cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria seeks US, French and Turkish 'ssustaining forces' to withdraw immediately
During his talk at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has already entered in eight years.
Moulalem, who also holds the post of the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are staying in the Syrian country illegally, with the pretext that they fight terrorism, and that "they will act with them in the right way."
"He must be removed immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of others have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy war until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "other foreign forces illegal."
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, which primarily train and advise Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moulalem said that conditions are good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "increasing fear" that forced refugees to stay away.
"We have called the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are policying a matter that must be completely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer help to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to raise a neutral area in the latest wave of rebellions in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political debates.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement avoided an attack on the vast scale of Russian-supported Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moulalem pointed out that the agreement had "clear instructions" and expressed confidence that military attacks would mark the jejads, including the fighters from the Nusra Front related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be defeated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to expand the way for elections.
Moulalem predicted conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reducing the needs of the current constitution," and warned that there was no interference.
Why Trump won a second command
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be resolved in 2020 except for the events when, as many people expect with liberal views, accusations and scandals, his presidency will soon come to an end.
That would certainly be "the most dramatic foundation of a president in history!"
So far, there's no sign of the viewer's lofting.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and has nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewer of 2.4 million during the peak hour, of 1.7 million years ago, while the MSNBC program, "The Rachel Maddow Show", has reached the top of the classification of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the evenings with big events.
"This is a fire, to which people draw because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor," which tells the history of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
It brings to mind a tax trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask her?
He was answered, "Because you make me laugh," said Mrs. Scowell.
There are fun values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can join and the health of the global economy.
It is a luxury that only privileged observers can face.
However, if you find yourself after six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of "spatial information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's comic book, worth 15 000 USD ("a clothed with arrogance," said The Washington Post) as well as the implications of Stormy Daniels' living descriptions, for the anatomity of Mr. Trump, then this goes beyond being an informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"One part of what he does and makes it look like a 'reality show' is that you eat with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the founder of the "Pawn Stars," related to the actors that surround and the daily developments of the Trump program (debates with N.F.L., commendations for Kim Jong-un).
You can't leave an episode without seeing you stay back.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was with the sun and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house in the north coast of Kauai, but he was hidden inside, seeing MSNBC, while he was registering CNN.
It was not possible to leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of the family.
"I remember when we implemented all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, "This is the last beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

The money from outside the private sector is placed in the close race for the Congress's elections
It is not surprising that the 17 Pennsylvania area is facing a cash deposit, as a result of the reorganization of the electoral areas that require two officials to run for the same post.
This recent reorganization in the Pittsburgh peripheral areas has established democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the post in another area, in special elections, the past spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12-year-old zone of Pennsylvania, which has survived the 17-year-old area.
This new distribution of maps came after the decision of the High Court of Pennsylvania, which, in January, stated that old areas had been designated in an unconstitutional and unjust way in favour of the Republicans.
This approach, in the new 17th area, has also fostered a strong commitment to the financing of campaigns by the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congress Fusats (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee for Fusatats (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a victory with close results in the special elections followed throughout March for the 18th election zone of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, he was held by the Republicans, and President Donald Trump won this area with 20 points of difference.
Politicians view democracies as easy favorites.
The United States considers punishing El Salvador for support to China, after withdrawing
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had owned a hotel in Panama until partners left the Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest sales not known to Taiwan," the department's spokesman, Heather Nauert, said during a statement in early this month.
But the penalties were examined only for El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million from the United States in 2017, including control of drug abuse, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties that included reductions in financial aid and the restrictions imposed on visas would be important for Central America's country and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings have progressed, North American and Central authorities support a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, an action that was considered to be open to money in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be developed, giving them every opportunity to decide punishments for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence has planned to hold a speech at the conference, which was predicted in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance of the administration's cost of this meeting, diplomats expressed themselves.
And three American envoys, returned peacefully from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak for internal discussions, in order to preserve their anonymity.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst near the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right to anonymity.
History Studio
The event of the order expected to occur could be the Special Prosecutor's report by Robert Mueller for possible arrest by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is transferring his investigation to verify if during his campaign, Mr. Trump has cooperated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes borders, Mr. Trump will have to give the bill before this body, at a time when it is ready to appear again before the voters, and perhaps it can be met by an independent judge.
These are many if, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s or his counterparts in Europe are unlikely.
All of us, from both Atlantic borders, must make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to crush the state against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Muan.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The lines of history depend on these steps, which speed up or slow down the path of democracy.
Currently, the Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump discharges General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation charges?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported, during the past year, that he had suggested that the president be heard secretly, as well as had been speculating that he was not fit to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times article wasn't right.
"How do we answer if the new investigation sought by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite the charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the next elections for a Congress that will consider Mr. Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I think we're not going to fail because of the teaching I took out in Prague.
My mother was a Hebrew woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that hosted the embassy's residence where I lived.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to build the Sabbath celebration on that table containing the symbol of the swastika.
Having this heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' player, Graham Dorrans is an optimist in front of the race with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers awaits Rapid Vienna knowing that a winner in front of the Austrians, after the welcome comparison in Spain to Villarreal, earlier this month, would be placed in a favourable position to qualify for the G group, the European Law.
An intrusion did not allow mesfustor Graham Dorrans to make the first presentation this season in comparison 2-2 to Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a force to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31st year.
"We went into the field believing that we could get something and get a point.
Perhaps we could have noted it in the end, but I generally believe that comparison was a true result.
Maybe they were better in the first part as we showed up in the second part and were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another big European evening.
I hope we can take three points but it will be a difficult struggle because they have achieved a positive outcome in their past struggle, but with the guys who support us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to the suffering and changes in the club, but now there is an optimization factor in this team.
Schools are good, and boys are enjoying it very much; education goes well.
I hope we can move forward, cut through the past season and succeed."
Women die less as a result of the fear of pension costs
Despite having a clear idea of how we wanted family members to be careful about them, few spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said that they talked to their husbands about the long - term expenses of care.
Only 10 percent responded that they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the deputy president of society for life insurance, Nationwide.
That's where we have to start.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not show them your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to benefit from caution, since these choices may be an important factor in setting costs.
Also take your financial adviser: The counselor can help you find a way to pay the expenses.
The long-term care funding options include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, hybrid life insurance policy to help save these expenses or self-sustainment through your assets - for as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorisation.
Take a health care lawyer and appoint a trusted person who will oversee your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the adoption of a prosecutor for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your name and will guarantee the payment of bills if you cannot do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your aged parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergics and medications he's taking?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you will be ready.
"It's not only the financial aspect of the game, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medication will you use?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A person is shot several times by a plane in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with a gun while he was going home after he had been out the night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the throats, stomachs, and hands.
Police officers stated that this was a "problem act", which took place about 02:30 BST.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The findings do not pose a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Accommodations and dinners in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and famine that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, while officials have declared that the number of dead is growing.
With the network of communications outside the function, the staff of the assistance have not been able to get information from Donghea's Regengen, a region in the north of Palu, which was near the earthquake epicenter with 7.5 waves.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below are some facts about Palu and Donganda, in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the central Sulawesi, which takes place at the end of a narrow journey on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379 800 inhabitants, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it fell from the earthquake and the famine.
Dondela is a giant giant that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastal edge of the island of Sulawesi.
Regenca, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and bloc are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Donghea.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morocco, on the other side of the north of Sulawesi.
According to the Disaster Relief Agency in Indonesia, Palu and Dondrea have been hit several times by food in the last 100 years.
In 1938 a famine struck more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donganda.
In 1996, another famine struck the western part of Donghea, causing nine victims.
Indonesia is located in the symmetrical zone of the Fireship in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by storms.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and coincidences of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a famine that hit 14 countries, causing 226 000 victims during the Indian coastal region, more than half of whom lived in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful storms hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Half of them lost their lives on the island of Nyas Island, in the coast of Sumatra.

More than 1100 people were left dead.
2010: A 7.5 - wave earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentawa, in Sumatra, causing an altitude of up to 10 feet [10 m] that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A cholera earthquake struck the Pity Jaya Regen in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic to people after remembering the destruction caused by the earthquake and the death penalty in 2004.
This time, there was no food, but more than 100 people lost their lives from building projects.
2018: Powerful interpretations hit the island of Lombok, taking more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.

Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on the charges of family violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on the charges of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by Alaska's state police, Palin, 29 years old, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspect of family violence, family violence, and arrest resistance.
According to the police report, when a woman, known as his name, tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he got the phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Preservation Hall and is being held a guarantee in the form of unsecured bonds worth 500 dollars, KTUU reported.
According to the reports of this network, he was brought before the courts on Saturday, and when he was asked about the admission of guilt, he said "it's absolutely innocent."
The palace is facing three categories of A, which means it can be imprisoned up to a year, and it's grossed by $250,000.
He is also accused of a category B fraud, which is punished with a day in prison and $2,000 in jail.
It's not the first time the criminal charges against Palin are filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This issue is currently being considered by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of family violence, family violence reporting and armed robbery during the incident.
His dear friend had claimed that he had hit him with his fist in his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by Vietnamese groups after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of the service in Iraq.
Accommodations and dinners in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have lost their lives on the seventh day, as a result of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5 - size earthquake caused a food shortage and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are out of service and the number of dead is expected to grow over the next few days.
The border hit the central part of Sulawesi, which is located in the north of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media clarifies video showing the time of the attack.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when we ate the bread.
Federal prosecutors seek a quick death penalty for suspecting the terrorist attack on NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for a death penalty for Shafullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been granted for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, aged 30, is alleged to have used a Home Depot steel truck to launch a terrorist attack on a road for bicycles along the western road, in the lower Manhattan, crossing the foothills and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must confirm that Saipov has killed eight victims "with a paramedic" and that he has caused serious physical injuries "with a paramedic", according to a letter aimed at seeking the death penalty, foretold in the southern part of New York.
According to a document of the Court, the death penalty can be imposed on both of these charges.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal Supreme Court filed Saipov against 22 suspects, including eight charges of murder in support of organized crime, charges often used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack has come as a consequence of "a considerable and well-planned planning," the prosecutors said, describing the way in which the crime is committed by Saipov as "unresponsible, cruel and moral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," says the letter.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time that New York's South Circle was criminalized in a death penalty case.
Innocent Khalid Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to permanent prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, it was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed in an electric car, on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documents, Saipov, with the Azerbaijani nation, did not express repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He's told the investigators that he feels good about what he's done, the police reported.
According to the record, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do the attack after ISIS's video on his cell phone.
The police said he had also requested to set up the ISIS flame in his hospital room.
He said he's innocent for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty and not to accept the sin associated with eternal imprisonment without the possibility of appeal will increase the trauma caused by these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously demanded prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
The Conservative Party's MEP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed at the top of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference, that it would "improve the army of the people".
The former leader of the UKIP said politicians should 'feel the pressure' of the Eurosceptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that he should be at the top of EU negotiations.
In March, Conservative Commissioner Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the MB 'would be out' if Brexit's secretary would be Mr. Farage.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to join her group is taken into account by conservatives for the EU's stand, who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is making it difficult to implement the compromise plan reached in Chequers, among attacks coming from those who want to stand or get away from the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Aleats insisted that it would try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of the harsh reactions - and would force Eurosceptics and laburists to choose between its package and the waste.
During the Lagrim engagement, Mr. Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should come to the front and give him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in the top, now we would be out.' he said.
Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers deal."
Expressing his attitude against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in the world wars to be subjugated.
We want to record our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone threw down the suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false'.
Conservator Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also in the interview and said to the journalists, "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers agreement is not limited to the general public, the opposition will not vote, not even within our party and the activists who filled the streets and voted for us.
Please leave Chequers and listen to me."
In a message directed to Mrs. May, she added, "The ministers hold the job place in the cases when they make promises."
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should 'feel the pressure' if they are thinking of giving up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter of belief between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you do anything like this.'
During a message directed to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'Two to force our political class, which is near Brexit's departure, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-government."
Meanwhile, the pros took the stand in Birmingham, before they held a tube that took two hours to the city center.
A small group of activists kept the banners written by the Conservatives against Brexit after this group was shown at the end of the week.
Laburists' support, Lord Adonis, ironically ironed with the conservators about the problems they had with a "social application" at the beginning of the conference.
'These are the people who tell us they can prepare IT systems and the technology needed for 'Canada plus' for open borders, for free trade with Ireland,' he added.
'It's totally a farm.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to 'think carefully' the possibility of the candidate for presidents
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that he will "consider carefully the possibility of the candidate for presidents" after the elections of November.
The Boston Globe reports that the democratic senator of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a joint meeting, held on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a continuing critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking to re-elect himself in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
She's been at the center of speculation that she can run in front of Trump in 2020.
The scheduled meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters according to the joint format, since the time Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to run for the President.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington and arrange for the government to be executed, and that includes the decision of a woman in the head."
arresting a person for the murder of the LSU team player, Wade Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday, that he arrested a suspect for the murder of basketballist Wade Sims during the Friday.
Dytheon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested about 11:00 a.m., reported to the Department of Police in Baton Rouge, during a media conference.
The police had published a video of the halls on the Friday, where they asked for help to identify the person who showed up there.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot in a fire and killed near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims changed his life as a result of the gun wounds caused by fire in his head," declared 247sports, chief of Murphy's police, J. Paul.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and shot Simpson.
Simpson took the question and admitted that he was in the position, held his gun, and had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and sent to the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
Sims, during 6'6'', played 32 games, of which 10 as the title, last season, with a average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 tops on the battle table.
Russia's big price: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team guidance gives him victory to Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the guidance of the Mercedes team" would play a significant role in this regard.
Bottas started out of the first place and almost hit Hamilton after protecting his position in the first two jirths and invited Vettel to attack his team friend.
Wettel was the first to make a stop and let Hamilton keep you in "traffick" at the end of the car group, something that had to have been decided.
Mercedes stopped a thief later and positioned after Vettel, but Hamilton came to the top after some manoeuvres that forced Ferrari's pilot to leave behind a double movement to protect them in the third floor.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first round of Saturday, on the day of his 21st day.
Later he was at the top of a large square after he didn't change the tires to reach a fast finish, and Kim Raikconen passed by the fourth row.
Eventually, he stopped at the 44th floor, but he couldn't improve the rhythm in the eight remaining jerets by leaving the fourth country of Raikkonen.
It's a hard day because Valtter had done a fantastic job all weekend and was shown a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these positions," Hamilton said.
Very Low Use of the Body’s Language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Diane Feinstein during a week's strike, related to her stand, that it was not the person who "saled" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, for sexual assault.
During a talk at a summit in Western Virginia, the president did not directly refer to you as a witness given by Ford in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, but he said that what was happening in Senate shows that people are "law, evil and innocent."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what's happening in the Senate over the last days is when you see the same thing, when you see people who are innocent, wicked, bad and innocent," he said.
"When you see the publications out of secret and then the people who say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you guys taking the letter?
Remember her answer... did you get your document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bring it out."
Wait a minute.
We haven't... no, we haven't, we haven't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford and the document came first in September — but Feinstein denied that the information had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't take her story to the store," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it as she asked me."
It seems that her denial was unacceptable to the president, who commented during the debate on Saturday evening: "I think the guests were really left to wish.
Maybe you didn't do it, but I've never seen any weaker findings before."
In defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which has been accused by three women for sexual misconduct, the president stated that the democracies are using alleged accusations to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power by any means.
They don't care who's hurt, who's going to get power and control," Mediaite reported as a statement by the president.

Air traffic controller lost his life, ensuring that hundreds of people on a plane survive the earthquake
An air traffic controller, in Indonesia, is respected as a hero after losing his life by ensuring that an aircraft holding hundreds of people safely descend.
Over 800 people lost their lives and many others were declared missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing such a famine.
Strong waves continue to worry about the area, and many people have been trapped in the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues stopped to rescue him, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that was suddenly thrown into the Palulian Airport "Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport".
He stood to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air flight plane, which was on the track at the time, could begin safely.
Then he got out of the traffic control tower when he thought she was hiding.
He lost his life in the hospital later.
"Air Navigation Indonesia" spokesman Johannes Sirai said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's "ABC News" reported.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balikapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This message is touching our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands, while the local disaster relief agency says that entry into the cities of Donghe, Sig and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to grow, since there are still many bodies under the letter, while others are not able," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said.
The waves that reached up to six feet [6 m] have destroyed Palon, where a deadly mass ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said about "Sky News": "Every minute ambulance brings bodies.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets have always been placed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Indonesian Creek is moving to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be even more complicated."
Indonesia's President, Joko Vidodo, arrived on Sunday in Palu and directed the country's army: "I'm asking you to work day and night to do all your evacuation duties.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by floods of previous years in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
Transfer to Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a person has lost after a plane crashed into the garage
The airline headed by a plane that was deployed in the Mikronese Peace League now announced a lost person, having previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the floating plane.
In a press release, "Air Niugini" said a passenger was not found on Saturday afternoon.
The airline stated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals, and searchers in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local park helped to save passengers and the plane after the plane crashed into the water by attempting to land in the Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been associated with the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable condition.
The reason for the delay and the resulting events itself remain unclear.
The U.S. Airline and Marine said the plane fell into the chain after the track had not reached it.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the bridge.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane dropped very low.
"That's an extraordinary good thing," said Jaynes.
Janes said that through the water that had reached the level of betel, he and other persons managed to reach the airport’s emergency exits.
He said the guards were panicking and shouting, while he turned a light lamp on his head.
The U.S. Navy stated that mariners who were working on a ladder there helped to rescue them, using a boat with air to transport people to the coast before a plane crashed about 30 meters (100 feet) below water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show 111 people have lost their lives on the planes recorded in PNG in the last two decades, but "Air Niugini" was not included in any of them.
The analyst builds the night’s chronology when a woman dies
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented her arguments in the trial of a person who was accused of being burned alive by a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
A U.S. Department of Justice analyst, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the court how he had used phone data to rebuild the movements of the homeless, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that the last changed his life.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he had received the location data from several cell phones that indicate that Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, this fact lowering his previous claims.
When the data found out his cell phone was in the same place with Chambers during the time he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to him about it.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When you were asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night was happening in the Sanford truck, the last one said, "you're lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding is Tellis' statement, who said he had met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone tables showed that they had only one week they knew each other.
Rowlet said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis had hidden messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He hid him from his life," said Hale.
It is expected that he will give a clear sign in the morning.
The judge declared that the court would make the decision that day.

Another man with color?!
I came from New York to get the couple out of work, after getting the "racist" message.
A father from New York has failed a couple of divorces since he received a wrong message from a mother, who is claiming that she was "another colored person."
Many have denied that they are racist, considering the tragedy as "dangerous."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that the new daughter, Giselle Maurice, was a colored woman, at the time she appeared on the first working day, in 2016.
"YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, IN THE NARRATOR ME," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending her husband away, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to New York Post, after he understood her fault, Plato-Flaxman, "feeling in the shadows," kissed Mrs. Maurice, reasoning that their current African-American fate had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work day alone and then sent home with a "catch in the pocket".
Now, Maurice is failing the two for compensation for leaving work, and she's looking for compensation at $350 a day for a period of six months, for which she was employed, even though without a contract.
"I want to tell them that they shouldn't do such things," she said on Friday for The Post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
Many have rejected claims that they are racist, saying that Maurice's expulsion was the right thing to do, because they were afraid they could no longer believe them after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said fellow Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But will you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been shown mercy, even though it is wrong?
Your son-in-law?
Tell me."
Considering the accident as "dangerous," Plasco said that he and his wife had brought a child, two months earlier and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you blame someone in this situation?
It's not a positive thing to do," went Plasco, the investment banker.
While the case has been brought to court, the public opinion has quickly challenged the couple in social media, criticising their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not create connections to a gold mine
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book came in, said about this letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a little iron to write the book for the child, would be upset if his work would be rejected, adding that 60 years of publication of the book, last year after his death, contained "poisonment and happiness".
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
"He was a quiet person and I didn't hide," she said.
"Padddington was so real that it was the same if you had a successful child: you feel proud of even though it's not exactly your success.
I think he looked at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington's own character."
My daughter was changing her life, and I was forced to say goodbye by phone.
After the birth, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, in the beginning, where doctors were trying to save her life but without results.
"Nada called me regularly to tell me that it was very serious, that she didn't believe she would go out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who told me she would die within two minutes and I should say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that had given her doctors to keep her heart at work were losing her effect and were being removed from her system.
She's been dead a while ago, and now everything's going to be "fucking."
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I should have been strong."
In time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, complaining about the loss of the child, went into a plane compared to other passengers -- who were unaware of what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down, and all the time they sat at my bedside.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight, I felt a big injury to Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Women who hold the moon post letters to prevent suicides in the water
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspiring messages in a stream in Wells as well as phone numbers that can call them for support.
Miss Davis was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I do every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "sniffy" smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
People always said his smile smells every room."
However, he quit his job before he changed his life, after it happened "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mr. Davis created the letters, "that people know that there are people who can help and who can talk to, even to a friend.
Don't stand alone - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt angry, depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, the change in behavior was new.
He was extremely upset on Christmas day--when the children opened their gifts, he didn't see them and did nothing."
She said his death was a great tragedy for them, but they had to lament, "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We were destroyed.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the fate of the family after the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought if we could give him something similar to what he wanted -- a limited investigation in time and in object -- maybe we could bring some harmony," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "suspending" between many opponents' obstacles.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to search the FBI?
Their excitement comes as a result of time.
Elections for Congress are only 5 weeks away, on November 6th - if the Republicans fail, as is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to select the person they want in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, demanding that they support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him, he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI brings her report?
It will be voted in Senate, where there are currently 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could gather at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Deputy President Mike Pence to end this situation and confirm it to the Supreme Court.

The number of deserters in North Korea has declined since Kim Jong came into power seven years ago, has declared a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of the Union in South Korea, has stated that there have been about 1127 injuries last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were stricter controls between North Korea and China as well as higher rates required by human beings traffickers.
Penny didn't make public comments.
Most of the deserters from North Korea are subsisting from South Korea.
Seoul has declared that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have passed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which has the longest length of the border with North Korea and can easily pass through it compared to the CMZ between two Koreas, which is protected from many forces.
China considers the deserters illegal, and not as refugees, and it is often hostile to them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved emotionally over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pennsylvania and their talks focused on late negotiations for denuclearization.
This meeting was followed by a historic meeting in June, between American President Donald Trump and Kim Young in Singapore, where they agreed, in general, to work for a Korean gun-free gaudy.
But, on September, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Reyong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress until then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we, in a uniform way, have the first quadruplets," said Mr. New during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic," and says he doesn't deserve to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Representative's Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court's "historic" appointment, and said that because of his temperature, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments on Sunday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think that if a woman had ever brought this way, people would say 'histerical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected categorically the charges that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were two teenagers.
During his presentation, Kavanaugh was very worried and at some point almost screamed or "takes his mouth" when he spoke about his family and the years of the gymnasium.
He accused Democrats in a way that was expressed before the Committee, calling charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated warning against his image", organised by liberals who were indicted from Hillary Clinton's loss in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi expressed his opinion that Kavanaugh’s testimony was proving that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, after it showed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
"I think he punished himself with those declarations and with the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi insisted on answering the question whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the event of his arrival, and in the case that the Democrats win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's incorrigible not only to the Supreme Court but also to the court where he is now," Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Law on Compulsory Care or on the Roe case against Wade, after being considered a conservative judge.
In the sessions for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would enforce the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a hysterical and uniform person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say "how good!"," Pelos said.
And women should take advantage of it.
This is a fair verbal attack, the whole month of the year in which the Indians explode, and it can't bring it to an end without crying.
"We cry when we're innocent," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual.
She continued, "It helped me a lot, a woman who worked in a leading position, who said that she also sang when she was anatomical, but she had a style that she used to be anatomical and began to sing, to say to the fellows, "You can think I'm sad and so I'm crying.
But in fact, I'm unintended."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought that was a brilliant idea."
Lots are a way of expressing anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men were raised, where at a point I found myself crying out of an uncontainable ink, was the moment when a larger woman caught a finger -- a sweet manager I had always had some fear - and was on my way to the stairs.
"Never let others see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're innocent.
They think you're upset, and they'll be glad they'll let you down."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic member of the Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart found himself in the midst of an extramarital relationship on the side of a park called "Monkey Business" and was expelled outside the garage, Mrs. Schroeder, who was an unsuspecting himself, realized that there was no reason why he would not even ask for presidents.
"It wasn't a well-fashioned decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called it "Borebarda and Seven Jochets."
Since the campaign was in its last stages, it had remained after the fund-raising, so it was estimated that it would not have been possible if it had not been able to collect $2 million.
But it was a tough war.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
"Don't they think I'm getting some water?" she asked herself.
During his speech that he would not develop an official campaign, he was so excited — thanks to the people who supported him, the anger with the system that made it so difficult for him to collect money and arrange for voters instead of delegates, and the hatred with sexism, so that he was killed.
"I think I've had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder regarding the way the press responded to her.
"It seemed as if Kleinex was my sponsoring corporation.
Remember what I thought people would write on my grave?
"What's that?"
US-China Trade War Advantages for Beijing
The first conflicts of trade between the US and China were disturbing, and as the war is far from over, a confrontation between the two countries can make a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, setting a tax on Chinese export main patterns, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most sensitive breakdown was what happened this week, when the new tariffs cost 200 billion dollars worth of coins, effectively taxing half of the coins entering the United States from China.
The fish is caught every time "natural" last time, setting rates from five to ten per cent over 60 billion US dollars.
China is about to return to the United States with the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is not about to be delivered quickly.
The removal of the massacres from Washington means you'll be handed over to their demands, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing for me to publicize before the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its letters properly, the pressures arising from the US trade war can support China in the long term in order to establish the partnership of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, which are rapidly taken in Washington as well as in Beijing, can cause economic downturns in each of these countries, is much more dangerous than what is seen outside," said Abigail Grace, a researcher associated with the research center for new American security, which is focused on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'gat' for the return of refugees,' says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making an appeal for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said conditions on the ground are improving.
"So, the situation in the country is much more stable and certainly thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Already, there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, where you have to be removed because of the terrorism and the single economic measures that hit their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have been removed from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
About six million others who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the damaged state.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the capital.

It was a hard year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and trusted me.
I'm very, very happy that we're reopening the store.
Success is the team, and I'm glad I saw the possibility of helping them," Garcia expressed quite excited after the team's winner of the European team.
He went through the words of his fellow international, John Ram, who defeated 2&1 U.S. golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges, Sunday.

U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing presentation, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought hard.
There were some moments during this paradise when we pushed pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Thank you, Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played pretty well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA in America as well as our Ryder Cup committee and we'll go ahead.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be the captain.
We need to get his hat off.
They played better than us."
