The members of the Gales Assembly are concerned that they take them for monies.
Continuation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently called AM, by the suggestion that they should change the name by MWP (Member of the Gales Parliament).
The debate was sworn by plans to change the name of the Assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid to be the object of reliculation.
A member of the Labour Party said to his group that he was worried that the new name "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For those who didn't know Gales, "twp" means "pwp" and "pwp" means "cock".
A member of the Plaid Cymru game showed that the set of the group "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Polish conservator said his group kept an "open mind" on the change of name, but he pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter "w" in Gales is similarly pronounced as the English word in Yorkshire of the letter "u".
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the wording to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any description of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Galesa Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals, which was very supportive of the name of the Gales Parliament.
With regard to the AM title, the committee preferred members from the Gales or the WMP, but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which the bill on changes is expected in weeks.
The Law on Reform will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, such as the rules of amm incapacity and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on how they should be called when they discuss the issue.
Macedonians join the Uranus by referring to changing the country's name
The electors will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has been with neighbor Greece for decades, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim in its territory and is repeatedly opposed to its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjerge Ivanov, who in the Plenary is opposed to the change of name, said he would make an excellent case of the vote.
However, the rapporteur's advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change in name is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep quiet while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders to whom I spoke said there was a bar and a church in every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now socialize people in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the rooms of being out of the bars to which people are usually going."
Regarding the churches, I'm afraid the money for the sale of assets doesn't last as long as the leaders wait, and "before or after they return where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by buildings of apartments with communities of owners of all types of people who would not help the bars remain holy.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, they will speed up the closing of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation changed in the 30s.
A black congregation next to the building was built.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by reverging John Howard Johnson, who led a boy to the tents of street 125, a commercial street in Harlem that refused to hire and climb to black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the very damaged building, but as Father Johnson's fries planned to rebuild it, they carried the carillion.
King David Johnson, son of his father Johnson and successor in St. Martin, humbly baptized the career as "the fields of the poor."
The expert who played the chariot in julio called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an insubstantiable historical instrument".
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first career in the world played by a black music, Dionysio A. Lind, who changed it by the biggest career of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one cared for his place in St. Martin.
Those who take care of St. Martin during the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parishional union, the body that rules the parish and which is composed of the laity leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing his concern that this last "he claims to affect the costs" to the assembly, although he did not participate in the contracting of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some frescoes complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A tyburon will kill a boy while fishing in California
The police reported that a tyburon attacked and hit a 13-year-old boy on the Sabbath while practicing submarine fishing in the search for lions in California on the first day of that cruise.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel brought him to the KSWB-TV in San Diego, which took about half an hour to walk with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with the bears, the moment he was born with a group of people to help get the water out.
Hammel said that at first I thought it was just an emotion for fishing a wolf, but then it became clear that I was crying "I was hurt!
They've worked for me!'
Hammel said he fell asleep when the boy came back.
"I call all the world out of the water: 'There's a tiger in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transferred to a helicopter to the child's Rady hospital in San Diego, where he is admitted to critical state.
The type of tyburon responsible for the attack is unknown.
Soccer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that they'd have a tyburon in the area a few weeks ago, but that they'd decide it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage on the top of the tower.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami's, to Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of tigers in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plan to enter the UK beauty market
Sansbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of the big warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable investment in the United Kingdom's beauty market, which amounts to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow while sales in fashion and products to feed are falling, the biggest players with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents across the country, and then the others will be successful next year.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets are looking for to fill the stops that they used on their day televisions, microwaves and cigarette products.
Sansbury's said he would double his offer of beauty products until 3,000 products were reached, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in tents like Boots.
The supermarket is also dropping its Boutique makeup range so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something more often demanded by the newest customer.
In addition, the perfume store, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Saninsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online purchases and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to convince people that they are visiting them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Saninsbury's, said that the establishments will always look more like commercial centers, as supermarkets try to compete with discounts such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's already introduced shopping points for Argos and Habitat in hundreds of tents, since he bought the two chains two years ago. It was seen that it strengthened the sales of food and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to modernise its pharmaceutical and beauty departments was a failure.
Sanisbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the association came to its end after a debate on how to share the income of the pharmaceuticals in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business formed by 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 million pounds three years ago.
He commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Saninsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that can be addressed to seek advice.
Our range of products is designed to adjust to all the needs and attractive and practical locations meaning that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old buying habits."
Peter Jones "furiso" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, went "freous" after the TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his house clothes and Truly accessories.
His company was compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old representative used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left the dragons' star at Den, Peter Jones throwing chips off his life-style brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "frequent" when the gold girl of the television admitted during a close meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that she had no time to dedicate her to the house dress brand and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to be compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, went to Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones took a plane to Great Britain and headed to one of his holiday residences.
One source said: "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It was his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left the atoms to all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a full store of goods in Marlow's offices to sell."
Experts believe that the absence of this morning's presenter is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost it to the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products that come from kitchens and candles to dress and textiles to cover it, and that it could still delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
Couples go together for vacations and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will be converted into the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a representative in the ITV program at Celebrity.
A close source to Jones said last night that "We shouldn't comment on his business issues."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He pointed out the criticisms that he would receive from the media by making a comment that some would consider "not a president's own" and that he would be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said putting his voice on the "television representative."
"I didn't say anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization were closed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the "responsive response" by the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his myth speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"Let's go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: ending the missile tests, helping free the hostages and making the rest of the U.S. soldiers return home.
And he defended his insulating strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people out here," said Trump signaling to the crowd that was right in front of him.
A sysmosis and tsunami crash an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national disaster had been declared, which is an essential condition for catalyticizing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was very clear that they would not ask for international assistance, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Summong.
While Save the Children is meeting a team to travel to Palu, it is still not clear whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a member of the national disaster management agency, assured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to their assistance.
Given the earthquakes that continue to afflict Indonesia, the country is extremely ill prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although it was built in Aceh for tunamis, it is not common to find them in other coastal areas.
Although an alert is issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, travel among many of Indonesia's islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital boat that was raised in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake will travel to Palu, but it will be at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's electoral campaign revolved around the improvement of the broken Indonesia infrastructures, and contributed money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a large lack of funds at the end of the next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their camps because of the confrontations in the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other miners.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the gol of the empath in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the First League before Chelsea with a gol in 89 minutes on the Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri, still about 27 metres from Chelsea's port with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the balloon with the left leg before he launched a shooting at the second floor.
The balloon crossed the area while moving towards the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling on an Arrizabalaga Kepa that flew into the air and entered the network.
"I just tried to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball in front of the best possible, so I tried to win the best possible time," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and from a touch without thinking too much and I just disappeared."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard marks at 25 minutes.
The front of the Azuis passed the ball of talent to Matthew Kovacic in that game, before he came close to the middle of the change and ran into the Liverpool field..
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the camp.
He made a beautiful move in depth driving Hazard towards the area.
Hazard exceeded the defense and ended the second peace by marking a shooting with the pig that Alison Becker was not able to stop.
Liverpool confronts Naples at the season of groups of the Championships League the Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europe League on Thursday 3rd in London.
The number of deaths of Indonesian tsunamis increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and in the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to a report by the National Disaster Management Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped between the roofs of the buildings that came down with a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and that caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press release, the voice of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman died being arrested.
He opened a murder investigation after he found the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white weapons wounds in John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old suspect of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something about a step forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I would like to make a call to contact anyone who is in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I'd also like to ask anyone, especially the taxis, to catch anything with the camera of the manned camera that is in contact with us, since they could have key information for our investigation.'
A police officer confirmed that the found body belongs to a neighbor of Birkenhead and that it was found within a property.
This evening, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police are in the process of informing the most accessible family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police reported that they didn't allow anyone to come and get out of the building.
The man was left with no words when he discovered what had happened.
The residents just knew they couldn't come back within hours.
He heard a police officer tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman crying in the scene.
Not to say 'it's horrible'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the hall with another train just outside.
Several officials remain inside the hall watching the block of apartments.
Anyone who has information, ask him to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, which calls to 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the phone number 0800 555 111, citing the record 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament became the last monument affected by the struggle by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for its destruction of many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its fanatic and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disarm" and to "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
They might have sacrificed Cromwell wrong by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the history of a figure that many consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defence of parliament before external pressure, in this case, of course, was dealt with by monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a side of the division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
A pig killed by a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer on the southeastern Chinese market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the appellant, "Yuan," was found dead with a split artery and blood cover close to a cut in the Liupanshui market, in the province of Guizhou.
A porcupine fan prepares to put the pigs' vaccines in a barrel on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he traveled with his turf from Yunnan's neighboring province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him the other attractive coat.
He said there was a big knife with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, some 250 kilograms, attacked the farmer to kill him.
"My cousin had the legs enchanted and snashed," said the first, calling "Wu," to the Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. of the cows to give him food to his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A market director told the Evening News that the pig was closed to avoid attacking anyone more, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, there will be cases of dogs that attack people earlier.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig nearly 300 pounds [300 kg] approached a galley farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and threatened the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs do not adopt aggressiveness, but that the taste of blood can act as a "smoker.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa prison will bring strong and generalized rain to the southwestern U.S.
The forecasts indicate that the Rosa fare weakens as it passes the cold waters from the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains north of Mexico and southwestern America in the next days.
On Sunday morning, October 5, Rosa was a Category 1 runner with winds more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a whale begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and to move east, towards the East Coast of the U.S.. As Rosa reaches the low California peninsula the moon as a tropical storm, she will start to push tropical humidity towards the north, which will penetrate the south-east of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico or the moon.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with valgade will create abundant and generalised rain in the south in the next days.
At the local level, precipitation between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, floods of debris and the possibility of land discharges in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the south-east, it expects 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially on much of Arizona.
Possibilities of repeated flooding with deterioration due to the different character of tropical rain.
We strongly advise you to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rivers could form cannons that could be converted into floating rivers, and electric storms would bring local winds and pos.
Valgada will bring locally strong rain to the south coast of California.
The total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which at its time could cause flow of smaller and narrow roads.
These would be the first rain of the cold season in the region.
Tropical dispersion pipes will begin to reach Arizona in the last hours of the Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends to the end of the moon and Tuesday.
Chuvia will come to Four Corners tomorrow, which will last until Wednesday.
October will be a witness to large temperature oscillations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropicals will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves important temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the constant heat will try to recover and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm start is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern planes to the north-east.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term meteorological forecast shows high probability of temperatures higher in the Middle East during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the judge at Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed in six television channels the dear witnesses to the Supreme Court named Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual aggression in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupts its usual programming for a new last hour of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Senator Jeff Flake, to enable the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee that he's a hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh made him play them while he was drunk and that he was trying to get his clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a loving witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
Nielsen reported the coming that over 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audit in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The digits were not immediately available for other strings that were transmitted to it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have trouble measuring people who come from offices.
To make an idea, it's a similar audience to a football final or Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was a second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million by Nielsen.
After the trial the interest continued.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday on television.
After a statement was made by the moderate Republican office indicating that Kavanaugh would vote in favour of him, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and supported by demonstrators when he tried to enter a road elevator at the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with the look down for several minutes while he was caught, televisiond directly at CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have the power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a statement, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say at the committee's hearing.
All television and cable lines were transmitted directly hours after the Judicial Committee had to vote in order to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh before the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the one named next week, which claimed a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations held with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Fleke made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by allegations against Kavanaugh.
The first British minister accuses the critics of "encouraging politics" with Brexit
In an interview with Journal Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused who criticised his plans to leave the European Union to "go beyond politics" with the future of Britain and to undermine national interest.
First Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
Another interview with her at the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should recast the rates on the other side was "all absurd".
Wade Sims murdered: the police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police stopped a suspect from carrying out the shootings that ended up as Wayde Sims's life, a 20-year-old LSU player (State University of Louisiana).
According to the baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-grade murder charge.
The officers released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims would lose the gates during the battle.
The police recovered the scene's gloves and said they contain Simpson's DNA, according to CBS's affiliated channel, WAFB.
After asking Simpson, the police said he admitted to being the shooting author who killed Wade.
The defense reported that a US$ 350,000 loan had been launched.
The East Baton Rouge parish office issued on Friday a preliminary report indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that arrived at the fish.
The department commended the unit of State police fugitives in Louisiana, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police police are the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces of the local order for their "justice and righteousness".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2,01-year-old was born in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU.
Its average of the past period was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
Tomorrow morning, LSU's Balloon instructor, Will Wade, said the team was "baptized" and "encouraged" by Wyade's escape.
"This is what worries us all the time," said Wade.
Volcano Red on Mexico City
The ashes that rocked the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern bars of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after detection of activities in the crater and to register 183 gas and lead emissions at 24 hours.
The center was watching several strangers and horrors.
The images of the social networks showed fine gray layers in the parabires of Mexico City's bars as Xochimilco.
The geophysics detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometres south of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Confrontation between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on the Sabbath after protestors were confronted by anti-disturbious police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizer vote on the Catalan sect.
A group of masked proseparatists containing police anti-disturbious gudding eggs and paints in order to create dark clouds in the streets that tend to be suitable for tourists.
There were also colds later that same day with the police, who used the bags to hold the garbage.
For several hours, groups of self-dependant groups that sang "I'm not forgotten or sorry" were faced with the Unionists who shouted "Living life in Spain".
Forty people had to be cared for by mild wounds received in the protest, according to local press.
The tension continues to grow in the independent region one year after the reference to October 1st celebrated by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted in abuffant way for independence, although the participation was low and the opposition to the section voted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in electoral exercises throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups spent the entire night of the Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration was also produced but was forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independent demonstration with his wife, said that he had no hope that Cataluna could achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I came to my parents crying with joy to the power to vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite obtaining an adjusted victory, although he decided, in the regional elections of December last year, this year the independent Catalan parties fought for maintaining the momentum, with many of their most known leaders in self-imposed exile or held in the waiting for trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by both gang politicians.
"There's more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to declare the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's goal gave Livingston the victory 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The elevator Livingston surprised the Rangers by bringing Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 parties as Ibrox Club's instructor.
Dolly Menga's goal was to get Gary Holt's team up a level following the Hibernian, second position.
Gerrard's team continues to walk out of the house this year in Premiership and next Sunday they meet the leader, Hearts, who separates them from eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive the Quick Vienna in Europe League the wolves.
Nameres, Livingston continues to invite in the division by six consecutive parties; the principal instructor, Holt, has not yet known the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingston lets you escape opportunities from weak visitors
Holt's team had to make a lot of progress before the moment they marked, because with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way but his cross-fire did not cross the border of the port; then Alan Lithgow's shot went out pushed by Craig Halkett's head from the other side of the port.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in the football games stopped.
And that's how the decisive wave came.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a shot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson united their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the balloon and walked from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated possession but met with an impenetrable defense that prevented him from working very hard at Liam Kelly's guardianship.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
The Rangers guard, Allan McGregor, stopped with a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow drove the ball out of another game to the balloon stopped in Livingston.
Many crossings in the Livingston area have been developed that have been continuously overlooked, while two requests for criminality have been rejected: one per hand and one for Halkett's entry to Glenn Middleton's replacement.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
An action and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
¿E unanimity, they were excellent and continue to overcome expectations in their rising trajectory.
Your game style and players have only changed since they returned to the top category, but part of the merit is Holt's way he pushed the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halket, the captain, led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave them no breath throughout the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers has missed their inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's orders, they did not reach that level on this occasion.
Last move failed. You were only able to enter the host team once. Any warning call for Rangers, which is found in half of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguity in Colombia
On Saturday, 29 September, there were tears and tears during the meeting of Turkish and German leaders to breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last anniversary of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to establish relations between NATO allies.
They discussed many issues, including human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan directed the Colonia to open up a new giant mix.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of the Kurds) also raised their voices by condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The pain of demonstrations reflects the division in front of a visitor called hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrats by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a low-fashioned cycler with a car
A cyclist landed in a college where a car was seen in London.
The accident took place close to the crossing between the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street streets, a transversated street in Deptford, south of the city, about 10:15 a.m. (British summer time).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man spoke in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in an atropel with escape in Childers Street a little over a mile and a half of the accident on the Sabbath.
The Metropolitan Police indicated that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses are turned on and they are advised by motorists who avoid the area.
Long Lattin Prison: six officers are injured in the riots
Six prison officers were injured in an alternative to high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance began in the HMP Long Lartin of Worcestershire around 09:30 hours (the summer hour in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers arrived to deal with the disturbances, involving eight prisoners who are contained in the palace.
Officials received attention for slight injuries in their face.
A voice from the prison service said: "He withdrew from the prison staff particularly trained to face a continuing incident in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be cared for by injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and they could spend more time among the kings."
HMP Long Lartin hosts over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June he knew that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disturbants officers had to go to prison to calm a revolution in which the person was arrested with billing bullets.
The Rosa Furcán threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with recent floods (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is very likely that the beginning of the next week will occur, when the remaining energy of the Rosa River passes through the Southeast Desert leaving the possibility of frequent flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of current floods for the moon and March of West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix tomorrow and arrive at the last hour of the moon with rain.
Phoenix's National Meteorology Service indicated in a publication on Twitter that "ten tropical cycles only maintain the state of depression or tropical storm in a 120 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread into a 64-kilometre radius of Arizona's border."
The latest models of Meteorloxia National Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with illogical quantities up to 150l/m2 in the Mogollón Bordo de Arizona.
Other areas of the Southeast Desert, such as the Central Rochosas and the Grand Conca, could reach up to 25 or 50 litres, with possible total islandings of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of recent floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, as the region is very affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southeast is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. dry monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drying, the second largest category," reported weather.com.
First, the Rosa farm will touch the ground in the low California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still be forced to drive on Sunday in the morning, with a wind of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and head north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is falling with cold water in the Pacific and thus losing strength.
For this reason it is hoped that it will touch the land in Mexico with a force of tropical storm in the morning or at night of the moon.
It could be very intense in some areas of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"The total precipitations are expected from 75 to 150 l/m2 from Lower California to the northwestern of Sonora, and can be found with up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Next, Rosa will head north through Mexico in the form of tropical storm before arriving at Arizona's border the first hour of March as a tropical depression and will continue to rise through Arizona and enter the south of Utah the last time of the night of March.
"The main danger of Rosa or what is left of these are the strong precipitations in the Netherlands California, in the north-east of Sonora and in the Southwest of the U.S.", the National Centre of Furacáns reported.
It is hoped that these rainwaters can cause raindrops and floods of rain in the deserts, and earthquakes in mountainous lands.
Aggression in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white weapons wounds.
The teenager was wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, the Saturday about 04:00 (British summer time).
She was taken to the hospital, where she remains stable.
According to Somerset police, during the night three boys were arrested in Radstock area of 17, 18 and 20 years respectively.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the event's mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh's Democratic Party's 'majority and collapse'
"Voice by Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the missing and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a myth in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "pained the blending and corollary" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of Congress the ywoves, where he took a category and emotionally charged Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually aggressive decades ago, being a teenager.
Ford also testified in court on his charge.
The president said on Saturday that that day the "Americans" were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and bravery.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a history of improvised public service," he said, referring to the multitude of admirers in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the Republican results in the half-mandate elections.
"Five weeks pass for some of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't do it, but really if I do it," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is "to resist and stop."
It is hoped that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh took place before Friday, according to which CNN indicated a representative of the Republican Party.
Indonesia's sysmism and tsunami cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on the Sabbath that at least 384 people were killed, many of them being dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the village of Palu when waves of up to six feet fell on the ground at the luscophus, bringing the lives of many and destroying everything on its way.
Tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"In the past, when threatened, the people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were defeated," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia disaster mitigation agency BNPB, said in a press release in Yacarta.
"The tsunami didn't just see, dragged cars, trucks, houses, pulled everything she found," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami would travel up to a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photographs distributed by the national disaster management agency showed many destroyed tents and buildings, retreats and broken bridges and a water mix.
The Replica continued to dry out the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have occurred in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the enormous winter sysmosis was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, was able to magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "dangerous" and said that thousands of homes, commercial hospitals and hotels would come down.
The bodies of some victims were caught under the debris of the damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and damages could be greater along the north coast of Palu, a zone called Donghea, which is closer to the epicenter of the sysm.
The communications were "all paralyzed and there is no information" in Donghea, adding Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," he reported to Cruz Vermella in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were on their way to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not having reported the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an affidavit recording shared in social networks, you can listen to a man who is found at the last floor of a building crying frrenetically by warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
In a matter of minutes water shocks against drinking in front of buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the writing authentication immediately.
The Sism and Tsunami caused an important disappearance that caused the Court of Communications throughout the Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Yacarta and other cities, but refugees continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport opened again but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The balance of the victims of Indonesia's tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the way that World Vision staff walked to get to the city of Palu, where the employees were rescued from the lava in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of total destruction, commented Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of launching assistance in the event of disaster, some complained that they were preventing Palu from travelling to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesia, funds, supplies and staff from abroad can only flow if the location of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And it hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Ariani, a voice from the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open ourselves to international aid, but it has not yet come."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of the winter, family and friends of the missing, hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that eased the argument of natural disasters."
They took a kid out of a sumo on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who took two days under the shoulder with her mother's body and her arm.
Gendon Subandon, the trainer of the national parapet Indonesian team, taught two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, who completed the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandiya added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the parapet field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told us how, in the hours following the broadcast of the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel between the parapentist community, he unexpectedly tried to send messages of WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, in the messages only a grey mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he added.
Rouban $26,750 while recharged a passenger in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was recharged by a driver in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Department of Police in Newport.
In the press note, researcher Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was emptying a boxer in the eight complex and was prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole him a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects left the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identity, contact the Newport police by number 859-292-3680.
The Kanye West rapist changed the name for Ye
The Kanye West rapist changed his name for Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be first known as Kanye West."
Some time ago West, 41 years old, was known as the album's album title, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande with the program, who cancelled his assistance by "emotional reasons", according to the program's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had already explained earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 't', it will say that same year while talking to the show with Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that exists in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rapists who changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year announced that he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
An old West co-workers, JAY-Z, also appeared by putting and removing the guinea and using the mauscules.
AMLO is committed not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, committed to refrain from using the military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a repressive war against the students is reached.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "I would no longer use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the beach killing about 300 people at the time the student movements were burning all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support the Mexican youth by providing monthly assistance to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led the boys to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double investment in I.A.
According to the investor and professional of IA Kai-Fu Lee, used by Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S.A., it should double the amount you invest in IA in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government announced about IA, even if the U.S. lacks a formal IA strategy.
Meanwhile, China had presented its plan or the previous year: it intended to be number 1 in IA innovation in 2030.
"Doubling the research budget in IA would be a good start, as the other countries are much more behind the US, and we are looking for the next big progress in IA," said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next IA was made in the U.S., said Lee to the CBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese companies of IA: Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won the American Othello player with a higher score and later was run in Microsoft Research from the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions as the robotic Network of the Advanced Defence Research Project Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next viewers.
In the U.S., researchers assume that they have to work hard to get government bags, says Lee.
"China is not the one who is taking the academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies hired university genes to work in IA.
Lee pointed out that changing the immigration policy could also help the U.S. to motivate its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in IA," he said.
The Council of State of China published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to persons of academic institutions in the same way that the National Foundation for Science and other governmental organizations distributed money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is less in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up an artistic intelligence centre designed to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the selected Artificial Information Committee.
And this month, the DARPA announced a $2,000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
Instead of the NSF, you are currently investing more than $100 million a year in IA research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. exclamation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not registered movement for months.
Macedonians voted in favour of changing the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in referring to whether they wanted to change their name to the Northern Macedonian Republic, a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and that would block requests for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and has seen its entry into the NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists claim that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would end 50 per cent of the minimum necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question contained in the report's paper was: "Is it in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
Defenders of the change of name, including former Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have voted for the future of the country, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament said that they would finish the vote and that they would do so definitively.
The change of nine would require a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularity would be recorded at 1 p.m..
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the recorded voters deposited their vote.
"I voted for my children, our site is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old capital voter, Skopje.
First Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko recorded their vote for Macedonia on the change in the name of the country that would open the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up for those who had broken the reference.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with the high head and not through the service door, Kavadarkov added.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can attract other countries, such as China and Russia, and enter into the Eurasian Union."
First Minister Zaev states that accession to NATO will bring the investment needed to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate above 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, the figure below the requirement.
Another survey carried out by Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 per cent of the people consulted were planning to vote on Sunday.
Well, 70 percent said he would vote yes.
In order to make the reference valid, the result must be 50 per cent more than one vote.
A failure in the reference would represent the first important attack on the policy of the prooccedential government since it entered into power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Agüero, player of Manchester City, through all the Bridgeton defense and finally marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took account of the defense of Brighton with 2-0 from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I made it look ridiculously simple to mark the gol at 65 minutes.
Argentinian front received a passage in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before he went to the open field.
Then Aguero found around four green shirts.
He failed a defense before crossing several more on the Brighton area.
Next, he passed the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch area to return the balloon to Aguero, which hit the Bridgeton Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right of the network.
"Aguero is going through some problems in the bed," said the City instructor, Pep Guardian, to the reporters.
"We're talking about 55 or 60 minutes to play.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to mark it at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Azulists the initial advantage in the front of the Premier League.
That gol came in the 29th minute.
Aguro got the balloon in the depth of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass to the right side of Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite position.
The blues put the ball in the door before leaving the camp.
The city is facing Hoffeneheim in the Campions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to party to the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to strengthen another title.
But a competitive Scherzer expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which will bring him a winning party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies ensured at least a position of the condom with the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still try to close their first division title.
"Although we haven't played anything, at least we can play the game knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably play at the highest level that I played this year.
Why don't I want to compete with that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opener will be on Sunday, but it seems to point out that Scherzer is what he is doing in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom your start number 34 would be, made another bulppen session and probably will launch Sunday on your usual rest day.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this time.
Trump celebrates a celebration in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the outcome in the mid-term elections.
"We'll do everything we did in November.
They're missing five weeks for some of the most important choices in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't do, but really if I do it and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "When I see this terrible radical group of Democrats, see what's going on now.
And they're determined to regain power using any necessary means, evil, and equality.
They don't care who harms, above whom they have to pass to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we'll never give it to them."
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And they've seen that in the past four days," he said, Qualifying the democracies of "announced, valvaded, naked and lying."
He numbered the Senate's Judicial Committee, citing Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who received strong applause from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Filter the document?
Mmm-hmm, huh?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It's not tolerant of expressing their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, you didn't surprise me too much.
after all, I'm the last of a series of working Members that we're not well received, and everything to say is our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because he faced a decision against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, sometimes topics on which Jeremy spoke with the previous leaders.
The notification to the Working Group of Nottingham East of Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of the eight years I took as a working Member, the meetings of the Committee on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and generous" policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if it has ever begun.
It is always more obvious that the working party does not tolerate different opinions and argue if all opinions are acceptable to the party's leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, when partners who wanted to share a similar political vision began to expect me to be withdrawn and adopt positions with those that would never agree, whether on national security or on the single EU market.
When I speak publicly, and in reality of a little like what it says, there is a horrendous bombing and attacks on social networks by censoring the central policy, saying I shouldn't be at the Laborist party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than some of my associates, because the comments I made to myself tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of the partners who face a torrent of existing or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have been standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every movement of "untrust" or every change in selection rules, the party becomes more intimate with views.
Over the past few years I have received many advice that urge me to keep my head covered, not to be so frank and that then "it would be all right for me".
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, led by the neglect of the government of Thatcher that literally left my school to fall, I tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, being both local and government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political positions and in which I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who have promoted the movement of the Friday, the only thing I would say is that while the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our firemen, companies and public services, I do not understand this desire to lose time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political consensus will discourage me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an Invitation Ayr put in his head
It may be that the last two attempts will change the final result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this threat from the First League of Tenent.
Now they lead the table and it's the only invital team of ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk taking him to victory, and the coach Peter Murchie had the whole right to be happy.
"So far we have tested ourselves in our party and followed inquisitions, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You have to admit that Ayr has taken better chances than we do."
The test in the 14th minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put before the Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, sent for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk about the numbers and Jason Baggot made a mistake.
Climate increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty before, just in the middle of the time, transformed a single shot, leaving the 17-5 marker in favor of Ayr in the rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged pause for the serious injury that he suffered by Ruardh Knott, who left the field in the mud and, from the beginning, Ayr made further progress through a test by Stafford McDowell, transformed by Climo.
The captain in Dde Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and Melrose took out a game of having a more player with Bruce Colvine's test that didn't consume, at the end of a very stressful period.
However, the local team returned and when Sruan Hutchinson received the yellow card to pay the climate when he didn't have the balloon, McPjherson marked a trial from the criminal line on the back of Ayr's grave.
The climate marked, as it almost did from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe collected the launch in the area of David Armstrong and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth test from the local team.
Still Game protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
The Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor interprets Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-protacts with his old friend Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the next nine hours will be the final, and Kierman seems to be planning another life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the Director of Affymorn Limited.
The actor negotiated to make comments, even though a Scottish Sun source implied that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "prosperous business of the restaurants" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the interior Bolivia expects the court to walk to the Pacific
The mariners were looking at an open-air ship in La Paz.
Public buildings go a blue flag.
Sailing bases from the Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are attached to the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Recovery is a duty."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a lost coast in Chile in a bloody conflict of resources of the 19th century continues to live, just as the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be in its most flexible point in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and seriousness and, of course, hopes for a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX's judgment on triggering screens throughout the country with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will declare itself in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of Bolivia from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia, who is facing a Polish battle for reelection next year, also has a lot in play in the sun's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia reason, and that it would not change if that happened.
The United Nations agency, located in the Netherlands, has no power to assist Chilean territory, and has claimed that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CIX judgment comes only six months after the final arguments we have heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", claims the Chilean expert at international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been delayed.
"The topic of sea access has taken a long time blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' beautiful rhetoric weakened the good will he had left in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks for a while, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have been free of exchange since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusual decision.
The Bolivian moon will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new phase of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end into 139 years of disputes with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be produced unless it can be trusted in the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong, states that his nation will not engage in nuclear disarmament if it cannot rely on Washington.
He spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that took place more than three decades after the summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that it is "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington he refused to accept the declaration without Pyongyang giving the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is generalised scepticism that Pyongyang speaks seriously about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion files reveal the last line of giant shadow that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of shaders or you want to be completely covered by the sun, do not search any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the past a series of extravasors for their spring-war 2019 collection that attracted the public with the purest style of the Paris fashion Week.
The impossible shadows filled Instagram this summer and these designers took away their most surprising creations.
Valentino's main piece was an excavated hair shirt decorated with a wide top imitation of flowers that washed the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were frozen sandwiches, a mago hat and even a pie, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also discovered a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had the cut lips and seemed more like Hannibal Lecter than the high suit.
One of the creatures seemed to be a full-time mergull team, with the gloves and the tube, and the other one with a short-lived tail.
And if it's from the big fashion, it's lucky.
The understandings in fashion predicted that the giant gorillas could reach the tents.
The disproportionate shadows come right after the "Bomb", the ball's shadow with a 60-centimeter that takes the whole world from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The cult mark behind the shadow impossible to invade all the social networks has taken over another great creation: an almost as large wooden beach bag as the model attached with a bathroom tray that carries it.
The popular orange rafi bag with rafios and finished with a white hair bag, was the top piece of the spring collection summer 2019 by Jacquemus' La Riviera in the week of Paris fashion.
The famous starist Luke Armitage declared to the F.D.: 'I hope that the great shadows and beach bags will reach the tent next summer, as the designer had such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for superior accessories'.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
The private schools of Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other Community matters.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS by their English seal), are working to provide the best level for students and their parents.
Private schools have the goal of preparing their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a plan of studies to measure, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that you understand, that will touch his head.
But speak to him in his own language, reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent studies this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the table and with higher approval rates in private schools.
One 68% of the students who studied foreign languages received an excess.
The data, compiled from 74 schools that comply with SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained an honor matrix in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved a superior.
This shows that Swedish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, languages are taking the same consideration as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all sorts of schools.
A survey carried out by the Commission for Employment and Training of the United Kingdom in 2014, indicated that among the lack of knowledge of languages, 17% of the reasons why entrepreneurs need to cover vacations.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly necessary to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more working possibilities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will put a person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by one percent of two digits, in this case a 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of the developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages vary according to school.
Some schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others are derived from the most important languages for the United Kingdom in the face of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what their children's interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialized teachers in this field.
Private Scottish schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills needed to triunize, whatever their future.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages are still vital for the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for the Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron started with Lakers or Sundays in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the serials who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
Team trainer Like Walton announced that James will play the first part of the premier against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still up to us to decide how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell published on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training for the beginning of the week, they asked James about his plans at the time of six Lakers.
At these heights of my career I don't need pre-time parties to be ready," he said.
Trump's electoral actions reach Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign mins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of the 5 mins programmed by Trump for the next week, including the stops in cities near him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote for confirmation in a break to allow your candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to receive support for the next half-mand elections, given that the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump's myth in West Virginia, and how can you see it online?
Trump's myth in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m.
You can see Trump's myth in West Virginia following by direct transmission via YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the subject of the trial held this week at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was again indicted by the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who hold the Senate's confirmation vote for a week while the FBI investigated.
But the main objective of this series of minutes is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
Therefore, these five minas that Trump will give the next week have as their goal "to dynamicize volunteers and sympathetic while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The control of Congress is so important to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in front of the campaign's time," said Reuters a trumpeter from Trump who preferred not to be named.
The myth of this night, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could gather the sympathetics of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Sabbath will be the second time in a month when Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician from the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The USA Team shows a lot to fight and keep the hope alive until the individual parties on Sunday
After three individual sessions, the Saturday morning exercise might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating drive pendulum is a fully invented sports concept but where sportsmen really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They've got a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we're taking it as a little push," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with sweeter in play.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel that they have a little bit of wind in favor and much to encourage, among other things, Spieth and Justin Thomas technique, who played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth has been literally from tea to green and is preaching with example.
These rubber rings were made stronger as they progressed their round, making a crucial putt to empathize the fourth game when Thomas and Thomas were two points below two.
When he got the putt that made them win the game at 15, he hit a similar bear, the guy who says he thinks the U.S. team is still not out.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only one left for these players now.
18 holes to get caught.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but praiseworthy European couple have four and cannot make mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and not the last nine o'clock Friday morning.
That passage, and the way it seems to flow its energy towards the crowd and from it, confirms them as the rivals fight on Sunday, and could not have more popular players to win a victory when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
preferable both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory continues to be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly disappeared Sergio García, the hero of tomorrow's fourballs, when he joined Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended up with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole that they were never close to going out.
But on Sunday there'll be no one to help get out of the hole.
The forums and forums are so fascinating to see close to the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, which is not the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team until now and had a significant advantage on the last day, but this forum session also showed that the United States team has the ability to fight, something that some, especially states, have doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the suburbs and the forums with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The double inspiration formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led to two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to raise four points to the marker in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to preserve the trophies they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fortnight, placing the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the forums, winning four parties, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual parties on Sunday to save the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first new European in winning four points, while Molinari, awarded "Molliwood", after a weekend of sensory, is the second pair in winning four points from the four first parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After unloading Woods and Patrick Reed in the suburbs, they qualified to defeat a detonated Woods and the new U.S. Bryson Dechambeau with 5&4 more categories.
Woods, who argued two parties on the unsound Saturday and glory, showed occasional flashlights, but now he lost 19 of 29 parties in the forums and forums and five followed.
Justin Rose, who was to rest in the woods this morning, came back together as his friend Henrik Stenson on the forums, throwing a hole in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three from the world.
Europe could not always win a beautiful spring day in the southeastern of Paris.
The three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas campaign set the point of reference for the United States by getting two points on Saturday.
They won a victory 2&1 over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the suburbs and won Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the forums after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in the history of Ryder Cup in which a team renumbered four points in the individual, although as the current trophie titler, Furyk's team only needs to emulate to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, an attack on Sunday seems to be out of its reach.
Cora do Norte not to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased its distrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced to the Annual General Assembly that North Korea would take "important measures to demonstrate its good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, demantling nuclear testing fields and committed to the proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see the corresponding answer by the U.S."
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first for our part."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization due to which North Korea would be rewarded as it took measures, its declaration seemed important, since it did not deny unilateral denuclearization as it happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump in the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has long been looking for a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to release the heavy international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearization" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive action, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us arrogant is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions undermine our confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead spot."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different than last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with Norwegian missiles after the "bad President" Trump called Kim "the man takes you to a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened with "completely destroying" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage to take action to disarmament, but said that there is still much work to do and that sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
The Mercer Trump said there was no time for it, and that "the same thing takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompey, told the UN Security Council that "the compliance with the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the nuclear and ballistic missiles of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had advanced, in just a few hours, that North Korea is accused of making "majous indone demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to detonate a Missile Use, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "recording measures".
He indicated that Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more so as to fight the growth of the magic culture to study all night inspired by caffeine.
One academic found that university students number one of the world’s students often do not know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of these in the United States.
It was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sound had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl arrived and said to me, 'Why are they only telling me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had spoken to him about the importance of sleeping, what surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to the students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sound habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving the general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that the students had a significant lack of sound during the week.
The course of a long time implies a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee bags, cortinas, trainers and books to get information about the effects of coffee and light and how the lack of sound affects the athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at the time of dedication.
In another section, participants are informed how the lack of long-term sleep may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the camps with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the conduct of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, in the same way that we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend all night awake still exists, and it adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students who were involved in a lack of sound was a growing problem.
To ensure that he sleeps well and has a sound of good quality must be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, signal it. Even avoid sneezing, since the lack of sound makes the brain intermittently insinuation, which makes him famous.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaian who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course throughout the camp.
The next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider the option of setting an alarm to be sounded, as well as for when they wake up. Also, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the " Blue Light" that emits the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can neutralize the circular rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal robs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack gave Stephen Gerard's disarmed team a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox wanted to record his first victory at home from the triumph for 4-1 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team took the second defeat of Gerarrd in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points of Hearts, leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the rest and an alliance of Rangers with a little inspiration never gave the feeling that it was empathizing.
While the Rangers descended to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third place and is just behind the Hibernian with a hole of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had been treated by a wound in his head by alleged launch of an object.
Gerard made eight changes about the team that took Ayr in the semifinals of Bethfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 of Livingston who took a point to the Hearts last week and would have been in love with the way his organized set put his opponents down at all times.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the balloon.
They might have marked in just two minutes when the short pass of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's port office, but the central champion lost this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to steal it in the second place.
The Rangers took control, but they seem to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Without a doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have been sentenced to 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the architect, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but the old guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had only problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head ending and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in 34 minutes could have been against the logic of the game, no one could deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong training.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher landed the balloon for Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the rest when changing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, but he almost had an immediate effect when the junta made a pass to Morelos, but the impostor Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to spoil visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long balloon behind each other.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor was perfectly raised to reject Jacobs before Lithgow was headed from the corner.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, claimed another criminal to be back with Jacobs, but Thomson again made the tough look.
German: Geiger counter inventor
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTADO... was the day the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger accountant.
A piece of science since then, Geiger also became a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" ("The Coronado Camps"), protagonized by those apparently insolable vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these auriculars are placed, the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals can be heard."
Evans, say, "I'm sure you're stalating now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that makes his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the default cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient, altering them in the laboratory
You can see a common protein in several types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient, which are changed to the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to several types of HER2 cancer and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Institute of Cancer of Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impresses the growth of several types of cancer", including mothers, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells in patients and "insinals" to address cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West aboard a speech in the favor of Trump using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat in his appearance on the Saturday Night Live program (SNL).
And the result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they supported Kanye West in the study after a confusing presentation in which he commended US President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented as a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third song of the night, called Ghost Town ("Pantama City"), in which he carried a dress of Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated their support to Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If he was worried about racism, he would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the program with a satire protagonized by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star ran from Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not exposed, Chris Rock came up with the images of West criticism on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get out of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the hearing that there had been a bad time in the tankers due to his throat.
"They came with me in the trunks.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat'.
They scared us!
And then they said it was my turn," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick it up?" saying, "I'm going to use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to go on?
Try with love."
His comments caused apologise in the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL list seemed to be ashamed, reported to the magazine Variety, with the following testimony that a person there gave the publication: "All the study remained in absolute silence."
They had named the West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, the young Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many perplexed people with an interpretation of the song I love it ("Enchantame"), dressed as a water bottle Perrier.
West won the support of the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the most powerful spirits: GRAZAS FOR FACER FANCE TO MAFIA"
However, the interviewer Karen Hunter wrote a tweet saying that West was just "to be who it is and that's completely wonderful".
"So and all, I chose NOT to reward anyone (including his music or clothes or support his "art") who I think is putting on and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "to be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for torture at the restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, said the police.
The accused is expected to be present before the Belfast Supreme Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword management role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The actor, who was 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of magic hero, saying that these roles on the screen are translated into what appears to be that boys have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently happened to the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she feels "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"In particular, I feel very strong at this moment. In what do we mistake us with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, according to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes boys feel they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how did we change that?
Because, obviously, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he won't make any pre-schools or history of Game of Thrones when the series comes to its end next summer, saying that "a lot of horses and fields of battle."
Since November, Kit will protagonize a True West (The True West), by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in this program, so, of course, she gave me my future family and my life here before," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygrintte's love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple happened in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 880,000 people in the country, health authorities have declared.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been promoted quickly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced practically to zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, in international terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people was extended.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men having sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters said that a member of the staff would filter data from the senators of the Republican Party, "dangerous lies" and "spiring theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. representative, Maxine Waters, charged that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republic Party on the pages of Wikipedia of the lecturers.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said that the statements were being made by websites and commentators of "ultradreity".
"Keepings, lies and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a Twitter statement.
Second, the information disseminated included the individual addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the government of the United States, during a hearing of the Senate panel on inappropriate sexual conduct charges against the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filter appeared shortly after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was associated with the Waters Department and revealed information from a member of the Waters staff, communicated with Capitol Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie," said Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were committed as a result of these false and false accusations, was not responsible in any way for the filtering of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie."
The subsequent Waters statement raised online criticisms, including those of the former Press Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This disappointment has become intense," wrote Fleischer.
"Let me understand that you don't have time to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
It should not be shown as challenging.
You must not question the reasons of the accused.
It must remain practical and serious."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to what critics accused of being too angry during the hearing of the mobs.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to disband Waters in the medium term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true" shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the entities responsible for compliance with the law and appropriate authorities with these fraudulent charges.
"We will make sure to find the guilty," he continued, "as well as that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my team."
Critical by Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in action), the paradigm of Rowan Atkinson's powerless species
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's cross-section in new movies from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of Johnny English's franchise and commission of action, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic dream of the obviously stupid issue that we are at the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any event, the incompetence character of Johnny English's eyes and rubber face renewed his license to destroy things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general chemical creation designed for non-englophone cinemas.
Of course, it is the poor secret agent who, despite his extraordinary claims of adjudicating glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a chisco by Mr. Bean and a similar one that contributed with a unique note on the theme of Carros of fire in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interpreted us now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, which made the fall on his way.
There's a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medium-duty armor and the rotor's legs make a short noise against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to the physical comedy jumps to the view, but it gives the impression that the humor has a little strength and is extremely superfluous, especially when this type of "serious" films, such as 007 and the Impossible Mission, are already using the comedy in a convincing way as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was directed to children instead of adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagances are not as exciting or concentrated as the film chips moved from Atkinson to the character of Bean.
Now the permanent argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cybernetic pirate infiltrates into the UK's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identity of all British actors in the area, for the distress of the service agent, a unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination for a prime minister of power and conflict, who has already experienced a total crisis of political instability: Emma Thompson gives you the best of yourself with this character that almost seems Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisers know that as all spies are committed, they must remove someone from the exit.
And that refers to the incompetence Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives extra-optimal classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some chips, when English offers the spy class to a rock school.
They take the English back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and meet with their old and suffering partner Bough, once again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an exciting role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
Because Batman and Robin of the wrongs of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the first minister is taking a dangerous step towards the enchanting of the multimillion-technological charisma that says he can solve the British computer problems: the Jason Volta sister, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their idea of ridiculous falsified falsifiers: chamoised, they fire a French host restaurant; they create a tumor that illegally places them on the edge of the Volta luxury ice; and English causes the entire anarchy to try to use virtual reality caches to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta house.
Obviously, all the detentions come out of this last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems to come out of a child television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as happened to other Johnny English films, couldn't they avoid thinking: the British cinema industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to design a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but they cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but that covers five.
Today, the party wants entrepreneurs to spend the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an additional day free.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same wage.
The sources say the idea would be "adapted" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to move the country to the benefit of the workers.
The Trade Union Congress supported four days a week's shift as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is hoped that a revision of the policies will be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to night, but a four-day working week is an ambition that adjusts to the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the general elections in 2017.
Thus, at present, the Labour Party does not support ambition in its entirety.
A member of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week does not go into the party's politics and is not being considered by this."
The chancellor in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "expectors" in public service companies.
The shadow Chancellor plans also include the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover their entire investment, as a labourer government could make "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in company councils and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the private-sector business shares to employees, which amount to up to 500 £ per year dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question was raised as to whether the department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, at the release of an interview, the "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could take away something that would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy showed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the charge came out and asked if I had done it.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems immeasurable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett shop around," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he mentioned could not verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star map that will act and a equally impressive mission, ending with world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people arriving in the Great Law area of Central Park, not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness about the real goal of ending the event with poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it actively.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant public had to complete a number of tasks or "actions", such as doing a volunteer, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness about its goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen at 12 years of age to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with free concerts is a genius way of persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of what is called "clictivism", people who think it makes a difference when signing a online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says he has registered more than 19 million "actions" of his followers, encouraging a set of different objectives.
He claims that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion established to influence lives of over 2250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or reimbursed.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have already had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.S. investor and executive company that committed to "help children develop to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Global Citizen tweets.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the sick, the national authorities and the sympathetic Global Citizen like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a note on the page of history," said the embassies of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ultman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "what makes you think we can end with extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-partity movements and in favour of the civil rights that preceded us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are some of the artists who will act on this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the sea to carry out a "block" to make Russian energy exports difficult, U.S. Secretary of Interior announced
"In case it is necessary," Washington may travel to the sea to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East, developed the US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment in Syria, especially where the legitimate government authorities operate, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with the same energy as they did in Eastern Europe," he said, according to reports.
In addition, according to the official, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capacity to ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke thus directed the participants to the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is called itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists more or less of the use and replacement of fuels," he commented, while referring to Russia saying that "only have a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
Statements were made while the administration of Trump was in a mission to push exports of its natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the own president, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the North Stream 2 oil pipeline, which, according to Trump, converted Berlin into "cativo" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly claimed that the North Stream 2 oil pipeline, which was set up to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a more economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's persistent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the idea that energy cannot be a force for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, bringing a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US's position resulted in Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German sector leader organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI, by its German signals), called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, BDI president, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren carefully reviewed her application to the presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he would carefully review his application to the presidency for midterm elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his application.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repeat the broken government and that includes a woman in power," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my application to the presidency."
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, saying he was "to take this country by wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticisms to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The next day, Warren commented on a tweet "of course there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, in a survey published by the ywoves, it showed that most of Warren's own voters do not believe that it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of the "problem" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator would not submit his application, according to the survey of the political research centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this application.
The survey showed more support for the candidate of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidate and 48 per cent opposition.
Other names of Democrats in relation to a possible candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden, and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially before January, he informed the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin quotes the postural stress disorder (TEPT) from Track Palin in Donald Trump's myth
Track Palin, 26 years old, has spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
The Monday night, they arrested and charged a domestic violence incident
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," said Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo topic and that his son and other war veterans, "are different, confused, wondering if there is any respect for why military and aviation partners, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
They arrested the moon in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged domestic violence against a woman, which involved a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon at the same time as a Jew, according to Dan Bennett, the police department of Vasilla.
18 states and the Columbia District challenge the new asylum policy
Twelve states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy in relation to a new U.S. policy that forbids asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
The next day, the representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friendly report from the Washington court to support an asylum-seekers who challenged politics, reported to NBC News.
The full name of the party requesting the price of Grace v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (United States for Civil Liberties) did not appear in August against federal policy.
He said that his partner "and his children members of a violent criminal organization" abused him, but that the U.S. officials refused his asylum request on 20 July.
You've lost them in Texas.
Lawyers from the States that support Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations facing problems that are generalized with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy voted in 2014 by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed the undocumented immigrants who escaped domestic violence to request asylum.
The general prosecutor of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international publications".
"The federal bill requires all asylum applications to be assisted according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and states that the prohibition against that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
Taxation continued to be discussed in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, explaining that it is likely that they become entrepreneurs and that they "give hand to work".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and the violence of criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their policy announcement on 11 June.
The asylum was never intended to relieve all problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Relief efforts desperate in Palu to the extent that the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her febril baby at the center of the abandoned city of Palu.
"Every minute there comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their wrong properties, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are disbanded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured the coast and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated with free air due to continuous and strong replications.
The babies covered her eyes as she explained how she felt that the violent earthquake had seized the hotel room in the fifth floor that she shared with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall fell upon me, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was in a flood in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then only silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of using "propagandistic ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page newspaper in the United States requesting the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, referred to the Chinese Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering with the United States Congress elections, which will be held on 6 November, making China refuse.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked what the officials of the country had watered in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to co-operate in China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war witness to the price level in their imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, China's compensating tariffs at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to presuppose state exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the ex-priorator of Iowa, one of China's main exporters of agricultural products, said Pequin threatened workers, farmers and North American entrepreneurs.
In an article of opinion written by Branstad and published in the edition of the Monday of the Moines Register, it was expressed that China "is intensifying this campaign of warning by spreading propaganda ads in the free US press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished North American tradition of freedom of expression and press when publishing a notice of payment in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"On the contrary, in the place of newspapers located at the end of this streets of Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the opinions that the Chinese may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he claims that "one of China's most important journals has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he has not confirmed that it is.
Kavanaugh's disaster leaves women's Republican vote to a few days of half-mandatory elections
Although many of the main Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially among female voters, in the next half-mandial elections.
The reactions to these allegations were numerous and the majority of the Republicans were positioned to continue with the vote.
"These things can't be solved," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the souls of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," reflected Karine Jean-Pierre, the main adviser and national spokesman of the progressive movementOn group, in Washington newspaper, D.C.
The following morning, the opponents, at the "Court November" flu, were shown in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the supervision of the Judicial Committee, decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's witness, told Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true that it's already high,
But it is still going to be more, especially among women who vote in favour of the bars outside or who are between 18 and 29 years of age, who still don't like the President, they don't like the urns."
Before Ford's public witness described his allegations of sexual aggression against the candidates of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This turned into a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the representative of the National Committee of the Republican, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the bank of the accused or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the United States is divided between believing in Ford's or in Kavanaugh's testimony, although they insist more on supporting this last one.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the people surveyed believe the Ford witness in total or probably, compared to 35% who supports the Kavanaugh witness.
In addition, a 38% believe that the most likely is that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, against a 30% who thinks of Ford himself.
With the pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford witnessed before the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked in a state of emergency when he was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed the genius at a university party when he studied in Yale in the 80s.
World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a solid-based company, the open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee had the chance that the intention to hide Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "line personal data storage" or POD.
Contact lists, pending tasks, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All of this makes this personal data storage unique is that the user has full control over who can access that information.
The company qualifies this as a "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its President John Bruce, is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to help Solid is available to the whole world.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about entering or not a complete change that would change their business models one day to another.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Wednesday afternoon, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new website based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet to establish the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been raised as an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as of the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new web era," added Berners-Lee.
Honor Bernard Vann, a concorded church with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only church of the Church of England that was concocted with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous honour in its hometown 100 years later.
The Colonel and Governor Bernard Vann was arrested on September 29, 1918, in the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attack.
However, he was killed by a franchisor four days later without knowing that he was granted the greatest British military condom.
On Saturday, their two grandsons were charged with discovering a memorial memorial in their honor in a file in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the façade of his grandfather who earned his title.
According to the publication London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a dense snow and under the game of a heavy metal fire".
Later he pressed to get to the fire line and, with a "great bravery," directed the line forward before he was hit with a cannon and without help from anyone, and to hit the three people of the enemy highlight.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German franchisor on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live, but a lesson like that."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a flower crown after the exhibition, which led to the young Brentwood Imperial band.
Michael Vann said he felt "my honor to participate in the show" and added that "the value of this genius hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut off the role of MMA employees at the best time
Imagine that you take all night smart to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part comes, something stops you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 battles, being six principals, and was being sent directly to the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But on the 6th morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald saw their faces, the United Kingdom spectators were terrified when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some didn't impress them after they had spent so many hours waiting to see the fight.
One associate described the change to these children's pictures on Twitter as "a very bad joke".
"The state law states that this content was not suitable for the 6th morning, and therefore it had to be changed to child programming," explained Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication vice-president of Bellator, when he was asked about the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said that they will take account of the United Kingdom exhibitors in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition," Coker said.
"But if it's 6 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will already be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I started to receive many messages and not all were happy.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will limit five wars, instead of six. We wanted to give the maximum to our loved ones, but we passed and
I'm very angry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels lower due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to the whole world because of his sexuality, but this makes him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the institute.
Invited from the first edition of the 4th radio program Desert Island Discs led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to see the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of this program, is low by disease.
As invited by Laverne's first program, Daley shared that he felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "he wasn't socially acceptable that you would like children and girls."
He even said, "Even today, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what prompted me and gave me the strength necessary to achieve success."
I wanted to prove it was "someone" so people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two olympic bronze medals, he became an outstanding LGBT activist and used his appearance in Australia's Commonwealth games to ask the most countries to express homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt lucky that he could live openly and without fear of the consequences, and he wanted to give others hope.
The three times the world champion said he was born by American actor Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise."
Daley faced this winner of a Oscar last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so little time" (with only 14 years of age he participated for the first time in the Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of your age who will experience similar heights.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he said.
"But now I know there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son to come back to London in 2012, he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell you I wouldn't be here to take care of that first row," shared Daley.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that exact moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that it was really not inevitable," adds.
The following year, Daley competed in 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment they knew that it was the dream of my life: to jump against a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling" confirms.
The choice of the Heather Small Proud song is not going either, because it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on his fingertips.

Mickelson's down on Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
The U.S. Phil Mickelson will play a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th part in Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his technique so that this doesn't become an unhappy event.
Mickelson, who participated in the 12th binary event, remained in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or Saturday's forums.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many times for the United States, the five-time campaign went through the day encouraging and working to improve its movements.
Although it was never the most necessary of the players, not even at the time of their career, at 48 years of age, it does not fit the Le Golf National field, where the tall tree tends to punish the wrong shots.
And because this wasn't enough, Mickelson faced on the ninth Sunday of the French Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four parties this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, begin with a good foot, the action of Mickelson could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he couldn't say much more.
"He understood the perfect role he played today, gave him a palm in his shoulder, stretched his arm, and told me he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"I fully trusted myself.
He has a prominent place in the Fama Hall and contributed a lot to the teams last week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end, that's the way things are, and that's how we think they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
I could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, a career that never came to the level of his individual palm tree.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intensive equipment.
"It's a fun, sarcastic person, with an enchant and likes to meet people, it's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I'd like to see if it's been passed by the younger players with this week.
It's much more with a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, is afraid of the loss of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup's individual can easily become a comfortable trip.
The Great Danes started in 1997 at a party in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the United States, but they finally reached the target line with a minimum advantage winning 141⁄2-131/2.
"You keep thinking that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; like Brooklyn, where we lost, but Valderrama won for a while," Bjorn reflected in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion winning 5-3 Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History shows that this hasn't finished yet.
Tomorrow you have to go to everybody.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't be tired of saying that, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but they're also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Thrilled with the performance of his players in a hard golf field, Bjorn added: "No singing won before time.
Tomorrow we'll meet another animal.
Tomorrow is the day of individual actions, and there we also have to prove our validity.
It's great to be with a partner on the side when things are going well, but when you face things individually, then prove your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to send to the players, which takes the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will find that his players have a better individual performance than with their partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who were three points of four.
The Furyk himself was in the arms of two extremes of these rounds of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, but ending up as a loser through the European miracle in Medina."
"I remember every one of the bad words," he answered when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, met the players in front of the last day.
"We have 12 important games, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brooklyn or Medinah.
When you see the impulse goes in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We prepare our alliance by taking this into account and put the players as we seemed, we want to do the maximum tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIllroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the classification.
"I decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
The new German warship put once more
The latest defeat of the German Army should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not reach at least the next year due to defective systems and the cost of increasing, they reported the local media.
The post in the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading boat of the battalions of the Baden-Wuertmberg class, joined the first half of 2019, and reported a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into Mariña in 2014, but the subsequent delivery problems affected the destination of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class boats, which the Army commissioned in 2007, will be replaced by the old Bremen class fractals.
It is understood that they will count with a powerful cannon, with different anti-erial and antibucco missiles, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infravermelles and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer-term maintenance periods, it should be possible to spread the latest to two years out of the source ports.
However, as pointed out by Die Zeit, these continuous delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be early when they enter service.
The fragrant F125 was news last year, when the German Army officially engaged in commissioning the ship and returned to the castle Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time Mariana returned a boat to a builder after the delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "critical defects in software and hardware" which prevented the use of the warship in a combat mission.
Software deficits were particularly important, since Baden-Wuertmenberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 mariners, i.e. half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class broken.
In addition, he discovered that the ship had a dramatic weight surplus, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Marina to add improvements to the future.
It is thought that the 7 thousand-tonne Rhineland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total project price, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the amazing amount of EUR 3300 million is already reached, compared with the 2200 million initials.
The problems of the new ones are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's shipping power is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that Mariana is staying without ships capable of detonating.
The official claims that this problem is increasingly, since the old boats were removed, but not replaced by others.
At the same time, he regretted that none of the bats of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Mariña.
National Trust Spits the Secret Life of the Mortgages
A new research being carried out at a corner of Scotland's Highlands aims to reveal how the dogs use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the results shed light on the behavior of these single travelers and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the Association National Trust for Scotland will follow the Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverwe in West Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the ants during the time.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis carried out by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the ants and that is doing every kind.
Next, a habit map will be drawn to create a detailed image on the landscape scale of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important to humans and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of forests and what is the best way to keep forests for insects and other associated species.
The population of swine in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom declined significantly in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and loss of habitat.
Aerogenizers and aluminum also pose a risk, as well as bat trapping, some chemical treatments of construction materials and domestic cat attacks.
The dogs are not blind,
But due to their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes at the time of getting married.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
NTSC, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is seriously affected by earthquakes.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic investigations, child inspections and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization also includes the only and first reserve of Scots in Threade State in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the eighth of the ten species of Scots.
David Thompson, State Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a big area for dogs," he says.
"We have old buildings, historical trees and an amazing habit.
But there are many things we still don't know about the pigs, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to improve."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of infants before carrying out maintenance tasks in the property, as it is possible that the indiscriminate destruction of a single child of maternity can kill up to 400 women and children, which could end all local population.
The dogs are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, kill them or destroy them, as well as destroy their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There is still much to learn about the ants and, in the case of many species, we don't know how he is going to his populations."
Ronaldo rejects the demands for rape and his lawyers are ready to ask the German publication
Christian Ronaldo Qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know by using his name.
Your lawyers will ask the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish these accusations.
The president of Portugal and the Juventus was charged with violating Kathryn Mayorga, a woman in the United States, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that the footballist paid the woman $375 000 so she didn't say anything about the incident, she published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his release, Ronaldo, 33 years old, hid this false news in a video from his Instagram account, which contains 142 million followers.
"No, not thousands of times not.
What was said today is false," said the camera five times the winner of the Gold Ball.
"People want to get to know you by using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous with just saying my name, as part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to ask Der Spiegel for charges, which qualify as "an unacceptable statement of suspects in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would ask for compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019 in a suite of Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After being met at a night club, Ronaldo and Maorga would have returned to the player's room, where he suspected he was raped anyway, according to the documents presented in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was proud to say that he was 99% a knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that both maintained sexual relations permitted by both parties.
However, he also insisted that he went to the police and that he had photographs of the wounded, but later he entered into an extrajudicial agreement because he felt devastated by the repressions and was worried about the public scandal.
A 34-year-old woman says she's trying to withdraw the agreement while she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer incorporated the Italian juve giant into an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would always lament the loss of its place as world car manufacturing leader after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK would say in the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production of its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that in the case of Brexit's failure to reach any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which was responsible for the manufacture of the Auris and Aventis models in Toyota, produced about 150 000 vehicles last year, exported a 90% of them to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will be witnesses of how the production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director-General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the operation of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the subcontractor's failure to reach an agreement in Brexit.
The Toyota production line is very adjusted, every 37 minutes it reaches parts of the United Kingdom and the EU suppliers for vehicles to be measured.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, the border could be affected and it could result in delays and loss of weight.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal rate more than one day on Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says that theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success but also take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent subcontractors."
Toyota could not appreciate how long the production would cease, but warned that in the long term the added costs would reduce the plant's competence and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, used by Burnaston for 24 years and a union coordinator of the United States, said his members are increasingly concerned: "For experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman stated that they presented a precise and critical plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could start again
The White House stated that the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and the Under-Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed a week more due to the struggle by the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russian and Trump's assistants, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
As long as Trump sends out to the general prosecutor-general, as if he does not, what would endanger Mueller's independence, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of withdrawing to the President by amendment 25th.
However, Rosenstein has received the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among the reports that indicated he was about to quit.
Instead, he announced a meeting with Trump, who was found in New York, the boys.
Trump said he would rather not have to defer to Rosenstein, but the meeting delayed to avoid a shock at the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
The next day, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Before the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is still no date set, it could be this week or another week late, given all that's going on in the upper court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists questioned that statement, since Sanders has been holding a press roll since September 10th.
When the representative Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of information session was not due to a threat to the majority of reporters, although he added that she would not be the one who rejects that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not mention any source that evaluates these data.
Information meetings will continue to be held, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask it directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than to direct the questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we've done this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press roll in which you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
However, the single press conferences are few.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the Anims before Brexit
The Health Secretariat sent a letter to EU workers in Scotland' NHS expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its desire to remain in the country beyond Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months that the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed itself to covering the cost of the state-wide requests for EU citizens to work in their decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on leave continued, and it is planned to end the decisions this autumn.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also intensified its preparations for possible non-agreement situations.
I know this is an inconsistencies period for everyone.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate the value of the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union, and above all, contribute an unforgettable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your refuge and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the weekend (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ de Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the trainer of Tennessee State, told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Looks like he's gone off when he got to the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before carrying it on a camel to carry out a later evaluation.
A Technician from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris, WSMV journalist at Nashville (Tennessee), that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old red shirt student, is in his first time with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries on the whole Saturday before leaving the party, which raised his total of the time at 18.
A stamp tax will apply to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help people not to be caught under the new conservation plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to those persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasure is expected to cost up to 120 million pounds a year to help people without losing weight
Foreign buyers will charge them a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help people without charge.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible lives and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money will serve to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The recharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second living and purchases for rent, may be up to 3 %.
Facenda expects the change to cost up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new buildings in London are marketed by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a living for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, were converted into "pantsma cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy will apply just weeks after Boris Johnson is requested to apply a cut in the fine-trading tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He told the great builders to keep the prices of the high livings by buying the sun and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on moderate price houses to set up the "grain of the lifestyle sector" that is in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of reform proposals in relation to life, including the control of residents and the prohibition of challenges in which the resident is not guilty.
He also wants to grant the most powerful councils at the time of building new living things.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it is necessary to set up the destructive market for living.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for those people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies based in the foreign country, to buy live animals than for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a lifetime is too far, and the indigenity that they suppose does not have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to teach Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, stated that his "last ambition" is being converted to Scotland's electorate for a while.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northeast Club, which currently covers the third floor of the League One, the three points of distance from the head.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last summer.
"When he was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B selection, and that's all," Ross said to the Sports Sound program of BBC Scotland.
"I used to see Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when he was a boy, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in directing a club."
Among Ross' predecessors in the Sunderland train station include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic's manager says he didn't feel worried about any of these so consolidated figures in a club so big after refusing previously proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will depend on this moment if I can return this club to the Prime League?
Because the club's structure and facilities are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to come, but it's probably just to think that I've succeeded here if I can get the club back to the Premier."
Ross only takes three years as a trainer after a helping period in Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the technical staff of Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and managed to get St. Mirren to be able to descend to win the title of the Championship at the next time.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he has ever found during his career in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Probably found me in a real crook," he recalled, about taking care of Allia.
"I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It's weird because it wasn't bad for me, I had a reasonable profit in life, and I enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure at work, but I like it.
I always liked to learn, and now that I am doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can hear the complete interview in Sportound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to a survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 17:30 a.m.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in the British pubs with more difficulty, but increased pressure on restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 percent during lunch, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA commercial consultant, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sundays and England's stay in the football world for more time than expected caused in July a pattern similar to that of June, in which the pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although the restaurants suffered even more punishment.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the business volume of restaurants during June began during the trial.
The pubs and bars specialized in drinking were the best results obtained with higher consumption than the cuts experienced by restaurants.
The specialized pubs in food also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out of here.
In controlled pubs and bars the consumption of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food consumption decreased by 3 per cent".
Paul Newman, used by RSM to analyse activities of bone and hospitality, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been produced since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful if this adds to the continuing cost increase.
The warm and long summer could not have reached a worse time for the restoration business and the time will be the task of saying whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the necessary breath for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was of 2.7 percent during the trial, which reflects desacceleration in the launch of the brands.
The sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry of the UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with total benefits of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector reference point.
One out of every five children has secret social networks that hide their parents
One of every five children (some of them only 11 years old) have secret social networks accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
This news caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "primary" account to show their parents
One of the five children (some of them only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted to 20,000 secondary students showed an increase in the number of accounts of "false Insta" (in reference to the social network of photos exchange).
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a sweet "primary" account to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to be "violent."
The research conducted by Digital Awarenss UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the boys and girls between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private accounts.
HMC's responsibility, Mike Buchanan, stated: "It turns out to be alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create spaces online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Eliidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Governing Council.
Doyle is the most gifted Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the last decade.
"There is a great deal of joy within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will greatly benefit from its inclusion in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I have a lot of wishes to make the athletes play and I hope I can contribute and help direct sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters in the Atlanta Games of 1996 between a total of four other Olympics and currently working as a regular commentator for BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only the time I could determine if I could recover and until I was hungry.
It was a boring job, but I was able to get back fully, I learned to walk again, and I am currently doing axilization exercises.
Can not open message
An announcement of a mother milk extractor compared to women with cows divided by public opinion on the networks
A parent milk extractor company shared public opinion on the networks with an announcement that compares the milking noses with cows that are moving.
To announce the launch of the declared "first silent mother milk extractor of the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new milk extractor offers to the babies.
Four royal mothers dance in a full-time fire for the cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like, "Yes, I did sing myself, but I don't have her" and "For if you don't count, they're not grapes, they're my pets."
The heart continues: "Mixe, mux, I'm feeding the babies, mux, mux, I'm multiplying my friends."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 plays and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions between the viewers. Many of them claimed that this appearance was the "dangerous" in the milk sector.
"Useing cows to announce this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to remain pregnant and give the light so that they can produce milk, but in their case we stole their children the days after giving the light," wrote one.

Another viewer commented: "Frequently traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But if so, why not use it to announce a milk extractor for the mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "This announcement with so little touch".
Other spectators defended the announcement, even a woman said that the song seemed "very kind to her."
"I think it's a great idea.
If he was still giving the pie, he'd buy one.
To get my milk out made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement's a little off, but I understood it as a joke.
I look like a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement directed to the mothers that extract their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like "vacas".
This is not an announcement to congratulate or condemn the milk industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the extractive discrepancy inserted into their suggestors.
The concept based on the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can easily fit into a maternal advisor, which gives women the freedom to move, suggest their babies, and even get out of there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a humiliating and provocative launch.
By describing the existing parallelism between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges involved as we demonstrated in an interesting and close way the incriminating sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time the Elvie extractor takes over the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures flew off the passageway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the relatively invariable monthly number of border crossings, partly due to the rhetorical burden and policies introduced by Trump administration, it was difficult to assign fathers to children.
Traditionally, most parents were also immigrants without papers and were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the possible parents and other adult members of their camps would have to send their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking immigration service and United States Customs Control, witnessed before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked for a divorce of minors without a partner.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal precedents.
"As far as 80% of the people who are parents or who are part of the fire are found in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners who committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require that some of these appear in court before they pass a month from their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the workers of the refusal.
Many will be represented by videoconference instead of person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements to receive assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they remain under guard, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may cause violent or flight attacks by the rest of the system's employees and reports published in the last few months.
Lawyers stated that these fears are increasing in centres of greater dimensions than Tornillo, where there are more possibilities than the symptoms that a child is suffering from misperception due to its size.
They also added that moving children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to leave friends might suggest a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the United States occupation forces, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, turning to the United Nations General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the war in the country was currently under way in their eighth year.
Moulalem, who also holds the charge of Vice First Minister, said that foreign forces were found in only illegally, with the intention of combating terrorism, and that they would be "occupied as an opportunity".
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that "war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 330,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurd forces and the Arab Syria against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country destroyed by the war.
On the subject of refugees, Moulalem stated that they were given the conditions appropriate for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational media" that caused refugees not to return.
"We will go to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicating what should be a very humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide assistance for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was concluded.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last great rebellion of Idlib allowed for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulalem stressed that the agreement had "clearly limited dates" and expressed his hope that military actions would have the fate of the dissidents, including Al-Nusra's troops linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to prepare a draft post-conflict constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
They expressed the conditions for ensuring the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the present constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second mandate
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would be able to re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, the impeccation and scandals put an end to his presidency in a premature manner.
That would certainly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, the prime-time audits have multiplied by more than two, reaching the 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million first-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million over the four years since Nielsen, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC led the cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights in which important news was produced.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for the ABC "Designed Survivor", which is a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack on Capitol.
In Scowell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver commented on Mr. Trump's vote.
Why? I asked him.
"He said, "Why do you laugh," said Mrs. Scowell to me.
There's entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the steps that Washington's garden can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, if immigrant families can reunite themselves and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only privileged viewers can be allowed.
Still, it says something that goes beyond being a informed citizen to spend six hours seeing a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", the blackout of avalanche of $15,000 of Paul Manafort" ("a full of arrogance", said Washington Pos) and the implications of the mysterious descriptions of Stormy Daniels on the anatomity of Mr. Trump.
I won't look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that you're giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, the executive executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with changes in the characters and daily arguments of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the praises to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to lose an episode or stay behind.
When I was in contact with Mr. Fleiss this week, he made the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, in the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house and sold the MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He was unable to resign while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court pending a son.
"Remember when we were making all these programs at that time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss commented.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to the coins to finance the candidates to the Camera for the selections of half of the billing
It is not surprising that the 17th Conventional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a Congregational District with two representatives in careers to take the same place.
This district located outside Pittsburg, which has recently been reorganised, is represented by the democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who achieved his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is presenting against another representative in functions, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is superseded in a large measure over the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the Republicans would manipulate the electoral circulation of the former districts to its favour.
The electoral career in the new 17th district of the congress held a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Committee on the Democratic Campaign of the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after reaching an adjusted victory in the special elections in March for the 18th district of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
This place was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts give democracies an advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of penalizing the Savior for its support to China and then moved back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and even had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed the Trump Organization's leadership team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to order the heads of the United States diplomatic missions of O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement made this month.
However, the possibility of applying sanctions against Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US dollars in 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was limited.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas, would have been very negative for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials encouraged the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent people from emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possible application of sanctions for the Savior.
It is scheduled that Vice-President Mike Pence will address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sense of the importance of the administration, the diplomats said.
The three North American envoys returned suddenly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or hard punishment coming from Washington.
A spokesman from Mr. Bolton's White House commented on the details of the debate, which were described by the three North American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations always and when the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
Their accounts were consolidated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also agreed to speak whenever their anonymity was maintained.
Learn History
The next negative case could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice, which currently has abundant evidence in the public file.
Secondly, Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump's campaign was based on Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to account in that body, just when it has to be prepared for the elections, and may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are very unknown and I do not suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the case with his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a state strike against Hitler if the western front was opposed and supported by the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that were subsequently produced.
The course of history revolves around these inflation points, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is facing several of these inflation points at these times.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump sends out to the Deputy State Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's research destiny?
Rosenstein brought water to the fish since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested writing in secret to the president and said that he was incapacitated to charge.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the information of The Times is not true.
"How will we answer if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite serious allegations of sexual and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the election of a Congress that demands responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subject to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was known to the embassies.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to take Shabat's changes on that table that included a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

The Player of Rangers Graham Dorrans appeared optimistic in front of the meeting against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receives the Rapid Vienna chaves knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive empathy achieved in Spain against the Villarreal this month, would place them in a very favorable position to classify themselves in the G group of Europe League.
An injury on the knee prevented central champion Graham Dorrans from starting this time to the empath 2-2 front of Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trapline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something positive and reach a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but in general, the empath is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second half.
The next Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope we can reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good outcome in their last game, but with the support of our public, I'm sure we can fight to achieve a positive outcome.
Last year it was hard among everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the team, but there is a great environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are going well and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget the past time and succeed."
Women worry about the demands for their citizenship
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear as they wanted to care for them, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by the Nationwide said that they commented on their partners on the cost of the extended care.
Only 10% said they'd talk to their children about the subject.
"People want you to care for a family, but they are not taking the necessary steps to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Department.
You can start by next.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family so they can't remember if you don't communicate with them your wishes with great anticipation.
It cooperates with your consultant and your family to agree on where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Among the long-term care funding options is a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that is effective to help cover these costs or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have money.
Sell your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure that the professionals do what you want if you are not able to communicate with you.
It also appreciates the possibility of signing a noticeable power to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your invoices are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your father or mother has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.

The agents described the shooting, which was produced about 02:30 (British summer time) as a "allerious act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Terremotos and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to increase.
Due to the shortness of the communications, the rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Donghea resistance, a area located north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Next we provide you with some key data on Palu and Donghea, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dondéna is a regent located over 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regression, a region lower than a province, accounted for a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main cornerstones of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Dongâna.
Nikkel mines are also important in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morouli, in the coast opposite of Celebes.
Palu and Donghea were affected by tsunamis several times during the last 100 years according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doggar.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donghea in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia found itself on the Cinth of the High-Sysmic Peace Fire, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered over the past few years:
2004: An important earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 degree magnitude earthquake struck the south of Xava, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, causing almost 700 people to die.
2009: It produced a 7.6 degree magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake affected the Isle of Mentawai, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed villages and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the resistance of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
There was no tsunami on this occasion, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which took place in the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily shot.
Arrest of Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president Sarah Palin, was charged with aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, of Vasilla, Alaska, was suspected of a domestic violence crime to prevent the submission of a complaint by domestic violence and resistance to the authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away.
Palin remains in a preventive prison in the units of Mat-Su Pretreal Facility with a $500 loan, according to KTUU.
He presented himself before the judge on the Sabbath, in which he declared "not guilty, since then" when he was asked, he reported the case.

He was also charged with a minor crime of type B, punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time there are criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to accuse the alleged attack.
The case was currently found in the Court of Justice for the Alasca War Veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, preventing the submission of a complaint by domestic violence and possession of weapons in Hebrew state in relation to the incident.
Your boyfriend accused him of putting a bullet in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking his son's violent behavior with post-rumatic stress disorder syndrome after serving with the army in Iraq.
A earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of holes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the balance of death is expected to increase over the course of the days.
The land produced just in front of Central Celebes, in the north of the Indonesian capital, Yacarta.
They circulate videos through social networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal taxes seek to apply a few times applied death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal taxes are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that occurred at the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, from 30 years old, had reportedly used a home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike on the adventure West Side Highway of Lower Manhattan, diverting the lives of the puns and cyclists he found on his way to October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the taxpayers will have to demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intently" and that he caused serious injuries "intensibly", according to the notification of the death penalty application submitted in the South New York District.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, practice commonly used by the tax authorities of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and vehicle destruction.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors declared by describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrosity, cruel and destructive" attention.
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco" as indicated in the report of intention of the prosecution.
Five of the victims were Argentinan tourists.
A decade ago, New York South District didn't make a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to the death penalty in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in the New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, nothing in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack in accordance with court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, as the police said.
Saipov declared to the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired in the ISIS videos that he showed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to be able to see ISIS's flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It was declared innocent of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the accused.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt with an endless chain of cancellation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all persons involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team will first ask the taxpayers who do not ask for the death penalty.
A Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit's negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a "people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians had to "press on" the Eurosceptic (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that negotiations with the EU should take place.
The ordinary Member, Peter Bone, said in front of the Birmingham show that the United Kingdom would have already left the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the divided lines of her party was evident when the Tories were united to remain in the EU with an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The first minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit's supporters, the opponents' and the EU's supporters.
Their allies stressed that they continued to fight to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their plan and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave of Solihul which he wanted to finish with the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have taken responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If it had been given in charge, we would already be out of the EU at these times," he said.
The Member of Parliament of Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must cancel the Chequers plan".
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone took the suggestions that indicated that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and that they want to stay in the EU is completely false".
The member of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns' board also attended, since he showed the reporters: "The only thing I'm saying is: first minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not like popularity among the public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, is impotence between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who handle the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The first ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make the politicians feel uncomfortable if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a subject of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them out with theirs."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are moving the army of people in this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the parties to remain in the EU made a march through Birmingham before a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A number of activists were sending cards with the message Tories Against Brexit (Touries against Brexit) after the group's mail on this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis bulgeed the conservators for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a free border, to enjoy free market without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute phrase.
The concept of good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren planned to seriously think about presenting himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously think of her application to the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a municipal session in a location in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the election in November against the republican Geoffrey Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It was focused on the speculations that took place as a result of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his voters using the form of the church since Trump took the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself to the president.
Warren replied that it is the moment when "the women are going to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and that makes a woman in the position of the presidency."
A arrest related to the murder of Sims, the LSU player
The baton Rouge police, Os Ánxeles, announced the Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wade Sims, the LSU gambling player on Friday.
The baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, in a press roll held at 11:00 (the hour of the east).
They'll publish a video from the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was out in the pictures.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was killed by shootings near the Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of this," reported police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to be present on the scene with a gun and admitted to shoot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and placed under custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2 - foot - old boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titularities last time and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 reboots per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton has reached the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It has been clear since Valtteri Bottas was classified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would be decisive in the race.
Butts, who had been from the field, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two times and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the first boxes and let Hamilton run traffic behind the group, something that would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the boxes a little later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed after several wheeled manoeuvres that caused Ferrari's driver to leave the inside at risk of being delayed after a double defense manoeuvre in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and mounted up to the seventh time at the end of the first time on his 21st anniversary.
Then he led the course during a large part of this thanks that he kept his pneumatics to get faster in the final part and to advance Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
He finally entered boxes around 44 but could not move any position on the last eight times, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth place.
It was a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real knight.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two spaces," said Hamilton.
A low-latency body language
President Donald Trump bloated Senator Diane Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insinuating that he would not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech carried out in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford to the Trial Committee of the Senate and commented on the place where what was happening in the Senate proved that the people were “merciful, repugnant and lying”.
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when anger is seen, when it is seen that people who are angry and who are miserable, repugnant and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any filtration?
Remember your answer... you filter the document?: "Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Filter him?...No," added imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in the beginning of September, but Feinstein proposed that the filter come from his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein said to the committee, as he reported to the newspaper The Hill.
"I asked him to keep his privacy and do what he asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night act: "I told you that the body language was not the proper one.
It may not be filtered, but it used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power through any means necessary.
They are wicked and rebellious, they don't care who give, who have to find power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two bullets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the wounded wound on the Friday in Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the 5-3 round game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won a quick advantage through two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie moved to the local community before Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard sent to Dundee before two bullets from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of Time for Adam Keefe's men, who were able to go back to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast the next night.
It was the fourth time meeting between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories of the Giants.
Dwyer's initial gol was produced at 3:35 p.m. thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
At an early stage, Sullivan re-mounted the local team at the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the gol of the empath at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants advance into the marker before the first break when he marked his second gol at night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard repatriated the game with a ball by power play at 27.37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined themselves to help Nielsen advance to Dundee for the first time at the end of the second period and ensured victory through the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who now lost four of their last five parties, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next party, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape from a plane
An Indonesian air controller considered hero after dying to ensure that a passenger-loaded aircraft with hundreds of passengers can be safely displayed.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many disappeared after a great earthquake took place on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong relics continue to feel in the area and many people are trapped under the castles of the city of Palu.
Although his workmates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung committed himself to leaving his seat in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri of Palu, which was violently balanced.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the exit track at the time, could be safely disbanded.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation portal, Johannes Sirait, stated that it is possible that this decision will allow hundreds of lives to be saved, reported Australia's ABC News channel.
We've prepared a Balikipan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we buried us," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death balance could be of thousands and the disaster management agency of the country claimed that access to the cities of Donghea, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance of victims is created which can continue to increase due to the fact that there are many bodies under the shells and many of them have not been able to reach," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the portor of the agency, said.
The waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and visas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is carrying bodies.
The potable water is leaking.
People are getting the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and communicated to the military in the country: "I ask you all who work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" He informed CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year's earthquake in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says there's a crash after an aircraft accident in a lake
The airline operating a flight that was launched in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now claims that there is a disappearance after the 47 passengers and crew had previously said that the plane was leaving without incident.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that from Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Area ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land on Chuuk Island.
The authorities said the Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all found stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of the events remains unclear.
Both the plane and the U.S. Army confirmed that the plane landed in the lake before arriving at the landing track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the landing track a long time ago.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and the other passengers were able to make progress between the water that reached their destination until the emergency exits of the plane that was about to collapse.
He also remembered that the flight assistants were crying and frightened, and that he suffered a mild wound in his head.
The U.S. Army indicated that some mariners who were working near the site in the repair tasks of a stone also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transfer people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 metres.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in plane accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but no one affected Air Niugini.
An analyst combines the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor handed down the evidence on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of smoking a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to compensate for the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis met Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the newspaper The Clear Ledger.
When these data showed that his mobile phone was meeting Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went to the street on Saturday and testified that that day was not found in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"Borrow of his life," said Hale.
It is scheduled that the defence begins its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge showed that he expected the judge to be seen to be judged by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?

The High Breed, a group of Bristol, says the hip hop has abandoned its origins with political and combative messages against social problems.
They want to return to their roots and get back that the fighting hip hop is again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced an appeal in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York Children's Watcher asks a couple after a "racist" message
A guardian of New York's children will ask a spouse for a discriminatory divorce after receiving a message that would not be directed to her from the mother in which she complained she was "other black."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her anguish when she found out that the guardian of children Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent Mrs Maurice twice.
After taking account of her mistake, a "incorded" plastic-Flaxman dismissed Mrs Maurice, saying that the caregiver who had just left, who was an African, had done his job badly and was expecting a Philippines according to the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice paid her work day and sent her home to Uber.
Now Maurice is going to ask the couple to get a compensation for the delay and ask for a compensation of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no medium-term contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen," he said to the Post the next day, adding "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism by saying that rejecting Maurice was the most reasonable, since they were afraid that they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife will send you a message that I didn't intend to send to you.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they had offended, even though it was due to an error?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with a "extortion", Plato declared that his wife had just had a baby for two months and that she had found herself in a "very difficult situation".
"They're going for someone like that?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers wouldn't be identified with a good talker as if they could end up in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the following letter: "It's hard to put into the hands of a person who first published it.
It's very funny to know what we know about the great success of Paddington now."
After stating that his father, who worked as a camera for BBC before he was inspired to write the child book on a small playout, would be optimistic about the possibility of rejecting his work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was "agridoce" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was clearly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"It was a hot man and nothing budgeting," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who did something: you're proud yet you didn't really do it to you.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was a creation of his imagination and a product of his imagination, he always gave him all merit to Paddington's own."
My daughter was dying, and she had to throw me through the phone.
After the earthquake, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"I didn't call regularly to say that it was very bad, that it wasn't expected to survive.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to drop her off.
And they did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors give you to keep your heart burning were slowly consuming and leaving your body.
She was dead a while ago, and now she's gone.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to wait."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment of struggle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without notice of the quarries she was suffering.
"No one has detected it," he said.
"He had his head down and he fell sick at all times.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive sense of solidarity by Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Postages of pregnant women to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards in a gallery bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers to those who can be called to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer depression, and he died at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that his son was a promising cook with a devastating smile.
"All the world knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile loved any room."
However, he left his job before he died and was "no deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he was murdered.
Mrs Davis commented: "I have continued concern that a collateral effect is being produced."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform the people that there are people who can come and talk to you, even though he's a friend.
Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't comment to me that he was sad or depressed or anything like it," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her attitude.
The day of Christmas touched the background (when the children opened their bags, he did not contact them with them or anything)".
He said his death was a tremendous tragedy for them, but they must overcome it: "The family disappeared.
It's hard for us.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future holds a son while the FBI begins the investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what we were asking for (a limited time and limited area investigation), it is possible that we could get a little unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "extended" due to the parallelization of the parties.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his fellow Republican sympathies want the FBI to do research?
Your reticence is due to a matter of time.
If, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to achieve the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to the horse, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI completes its report?
A vote will be taken on the Senate, which is currently taking over 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to break the empatt and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is below Kim's mandate
The number of North Korea deserters destined for South Korea decreased since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea lecturer.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korea Union Ministry of Unity, stated that 1.127 deserts will be produced during the last year, far from the 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park said that the rise in border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the rates charged by the persons responsible for crossing people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang didn't make any public comments.
To the great majority of the deserters of the North finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
It is only stated that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them focus on China, which has the largest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal immigrants instead of refugees and often repatriate them obliged.
The relations between the north and the south (who technically continue in war) have improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were being parked.
This was followed by a historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-a member of Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security and, under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will be first in a unilateral way disarmed," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it's not appropriate to access the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in Camera, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and made sure that he was not suitable for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a woman behaves this way sometimes, she would call her history," Pelosi said about her reaction to the Kavanaugh statement against the Senate's Judicial Committee on the Rights.
Kavanaugh was emotionally charged with sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh showed very excited, on occasions almost crying and remaining speaking while describing his family and the years of his school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's Democrats, cataloging the charges against him as a "mortem of the gross and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals fed by the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think it is disqualifies itself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked if he would try to force Kavanaugh if it was confirmed in the place and if the Democrats got most of the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is the following: if you are not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where it is currently found," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that could be adopted by Kavanaugh against the protection law for the patient and the care of accessable health or the case of Roe against Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In confirmation, Kavanaugh failed to ask whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be cancelled.
"It's not the time for a historical person to get to the court and still wait for us to say, look well," said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
He's treated a justified diaphragm, months and years of anger, and he can't blow it out without crying.
"We're pregnant when we're pregnant," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so weird, do I?"
He continued: "I received a lot of help from a woman who was running somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique consisting of where, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, he went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
The bags are allowed as an escape valve for partial anger because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most intimate memories of my first work in a man-dominated office, in which I began to cry with an impossible rage to describe, was that a bigger woman approached me from behind the fish, a farthest one that always caused me a fear of a lightning, and led me to the step of the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll comfort you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congressman in Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an adventure outside the marriage on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not be considered to be present to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I said to myself 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the seven Ananos."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fund-raising, so he swore he wouldn't get in the race by the presidency unless he was able to earn $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported him contributed $1,000 to male candidates only to $250.
"What do you think, that I'm out of line?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by the emotions (freeness to the people he supported, frustration to the system that made it difficult to raise money and to address voters instead of delegates and to focus on existing sexism) that remained without words.
"You think it's a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how she responded to the press with her.

How the trade war between the United States and China can turn out to be positive
The initial bombings of the US-China trade war were devastating and, although the war is far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scaling took place this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent to $200 million, saving half of the articles coming from China to the United States.
Pekkin has been attacked every time in the same way, the most recent rising rates of five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China promised to imitate the US measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would move in the short term.
In order to get Washington back, it would be necessary to submit to his demands, but to do so publicly before the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Pequin can play his letters correctly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could long favour China by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions needed to initiate a economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than it was previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research center in Asia of the Center for New American Security, a research center.
Syria is "list" for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moulalem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions needed for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from any of the countries supporting the rise.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final marker from 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National Club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The U.S. Star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the 16-per 3, bridge, losing its battle against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfist shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was defeated by the player with the worst rating of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, in Denmark.
The first ranked in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against the English Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups discussed, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament wins, with 25.5 points.
"I'm not used to crying often, but today I can't avoid it.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to recover the cup.
The important thing is the team, and I am glad to be able to help," said an enthusiastic García after European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who was able to defeat the U.S. golfer Tiger Woods by 2&1 on Sunday's individual party.
"It's imprecise the pride I feel today because I can defeat Tiger Woods. I thought I'd see to play that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four parties in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 grand, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend so that they wouldn't get out of the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a golf of a high caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I was proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they faced difficulties with Europeans.
Let's fight.
I remove the shadow from Thomas's face.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to get the shadow out.
It's better."
