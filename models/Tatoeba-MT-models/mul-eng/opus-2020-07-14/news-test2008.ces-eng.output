Inflation in Europe has led to food shortages
The accelerated inflation targeted at the euro area is mainly due to an unprecedented increase in food prices.
The price growth in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded in October, announced by the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union.
The official preamble estimated only 3 per cent, sent the Bloomberg Agency.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian Emissions Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the basic rate of interest by reducing, together with rising prices of raw materials and reducing unemployment, inflation flows.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two per cent, even in their proximity.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation must be "ordained", so that it will no longer have to do anything about it.
In Germany, the November inflation rate is 3.3 per cent of the fifteen-year record; in Spain it is 3.6 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has been high due to the scarcity of food and energy prices.
The terminal prices of wheat rose by 88 per cent, as well as the course of soji reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, more than one oil and milk products had to be paid in 2007.
The price of roses on world markets this year stood at 52 per cent and last month has already become one bar of black gold about $100.
According to the ECB, inflation is starting in 2008 from 2.1 per cent of the year to 2.5, and in 2009 it is almost 1.9.
According to the analysis, the 12-month inflation rate will remain approximately 3 per cent in the following 3-4 months, despite its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double its interest rates during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The area of the Fides' hunger strike after the deceleration rate at the beginning of the decade has grown significantly, and it is now available to the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute's socialists, 13 per cent of the aid has never been planned.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater consensus of the opposition voters - would represent more than double support (71 per cent) for the sale of the fifth MSZP support.
MDF and SZDSZ are according to a survey under the heading for entry into Parliament: their support throughout the population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, there are two camps in one percentage more.
The public's view of the economy has also deteriorated because of the previous minimum - it has never been the rate of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while, according to other 46 per cent, the situation is quite bad.
The family's appreciation will change its material situation after the summer and summer prospects are now becoming more pessimistic.
As regards the next year, most of the population is affected by further deterioration and only ten improvements.
At the hearing, 71 per cent of the respondents were asked, most of all of the Gallup Institute's findings that the prime minister is doing his job worse than good.
Ferenci Gyurcsanay believes or strongly believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Victor Orbán shares 38 percent of the respondents.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 per cent, the President of the Fidesz County 27 per cent.
One of the indicators of political development is how much of the public is believed to be able to deal with the prime minister's discontent without change of government.
While the government and the prime minister considered the maintenance of 35 per cent after London's regular rooms, this share already represented only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) is only looking at solutions in writing for new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is significant that 60 per cent of the respondents replied to a question concerning their respective participation in the referendum, that it would definitely come and that 20 per cent would report that it would probably be.
For comparison, "Parliamentary elections of this week" would certainly be only 55 per cent and 15 per cent would consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be inevitable on the basis of the current ideas.
The school would say not 74, 79 doctor fees and 84 per cent residence fees.
If we look at the same proportions in the same area of people's participation, then the introduction of school fees, payments to doctors and fees to stay in the hospital would be 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most important is Auchan, almost five times the Tesco.
The hypermarkets in the Bulgarian trade trolley maintained a low rate of 16 per cent increase in prices with the difference that this year did not lead to an increase in GDP.
Article of the Danish Napi Economy
The average price consumption of Napi Gazdazz in the Buddhist trade year increased by 16 per cent, as well as in all hypermarkets, there has been a marked increase of over a thousand forints at the price.
Since the prices in the supermarkets are already falling down in the average, there has been no so drastic impact on the basis of the previous high base.
For consumers, however, it is certainly not pleasant that what can be bought at a price of less than nine thousand Forints does not now amount to tens of thousands.
The necessary share of the Daily Economy in the hypermarkets has exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forts of at least 91 fort.
The highest hair price was 10,573 Forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumption of 6,800 forts.)
The price of Unica and the living fish remained so low, but also greatly influenced the cruel hair, hair, and also the mammoth.
The prices of bread and milk correspond to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan and at 139 pounds.
Competition did not come at the price of the product under 200 forts.
Similarly, in this trade it was surprising that the price of two-wheeled Coca Coly in the neck was less than 200 forts, so the product remained only 257 forts.
However, this year he took Napi Gazdas Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as the youngest.
According to our estimates, the price of figuring in the consumer’s pocket of Napi Gazdazdáz is about 15 per cent of the price of Christmas Christmas Cora, while Tesco and Auchan are about 18 per cent.
In comparison with the lowest and lowest annual consumption of the hair, the difference was 12 per cent, while growth between the lowest and the highest of the year was 21 per cent.
There was an increase of 1,480 forints.
The average increase in the price of the wool was 1,206 Forints, with the impact of the price of the wool on the Christmas season on the growth of the DPH.
It is clear that the sale process has been broken down, that commercial households have not been able to determine how large price differences are to be established in individual products, as they have not been able to predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader is planning the pace of the product concerned wrong, it may be a significant profit due to the price variation of the route adjusted.)
Due to DPH, the rise in consumer hair prices by the Napi Gazdaz has been so extreme that the price of the lowest hair was 1,720 forts higher than in 2006, while the lowest made the price difference of 844 forts.
This year did not reveal such a national difference, the most expensive cheese now stood at 1,630 forts more than inland and also at 1,284 fortifications.
In comparison with the two summer seasons, there was a marked catastrophic increase in prices, with daily consumption in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 per cent for less than 20 months.
(Other than that, it does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistical Authority: it intended for several basic foods to increase prices by more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to milk, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumption rate of the Daily Economy it seems impossible, because the price of the product, quite expensive already in the last year, appeared on the basis of and in the worst case, the price growth rate is over 10 per cent.
In addition, the supplemental molluscs are more active than the adder eggs, the drastic price increase has also been allowed to occur in international markets.
Hypermarkets in the commercial gold triangle do not complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited trades are no longer interested in prices.
They're buying all the money, they're carrying the constant food.
In the middle of the afternoon, in all three supermarkets, long fronts were created in the afternoon, as the spring grew to the number of visitors.
As far as we know, abroad, the business is lower, most international netizens are concerned by the research firm that markets remain behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places it is depicted in the disinfectant media
More than a thousand cases of infection have been reported in hospitals during the annual year due to an inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of the patient, the filling of the bed, the overload of the staff of the ban do not help, claims the beneficiary of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, they are also exposed to disinfectants.
A recently diagnosed MRSA infection was diagnosed in the Traumatological Division of the Holy Jana Hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics have been found in men who have reached the hospital after serious transport accidents.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in serious car accidents was released at home, but soon thereafter he had to return to the MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body he has not yet had an important operation.
On 10 December, the National System of Nesocomialis Survey was reported to have 1,094 disease infections caused by multi-resistant causes of disability, told Karolina Böröcsová, the primary of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resident causes were registered in patients with safety, not known to others.
About two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin with a resistant gold staphylctomy.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries three thirds of the people in the nose without causing disease.
The infections caused by SA (e. g., cancer, skin infection, infection) react well to antibiotics and are well treated.
However, if antibiotics are administered in excess or inadequately, they are derived from bacteria that respond well to bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and which are rapidly spreading under adverse medical conditions.
In particular, in the case of transient or persistent immunosuppression of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight, or in patients in years, serious medical infections, such as early infection or blood - sepsis, may occur.
According to the superior physician of the Holy Jana, there is nothing special about the infection of MRSA, similar infections in patients with daily practice.
"The infection must not be replaced with the epidemic, MRSA is not just there," Tibor Nyulasi declared, "where the presence of the source of the disease is not tested."
Illustrating antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the healing staff heals them in rubber gloves and in masks and we need antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients receiving a hospital have been tested to see if MRSA is present in their body, however, the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample Selection Not in Mode
A significant majority of MRSA-related infections could be transmitted, despite current measurements and conditions in the home hospitals are not to prevent the occurrence and spread of multi-resistant unresponsible causes, says Karolina Börczová.
Since this infection occurs significantly in hospitals and nursing homes, patients treated should control and carry MRSA immediately.
The collection of microbiological samples is not yet in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
In most cases, it has been reported that the epidemiological center's primary epidemiological center is the patient who suffers from MRSA.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotics therapy is targeted, or microbiological studies should be conducted to limit the incidence of resistance to medicines, even if these patients are not available in all cases.
The microbiological samples are more common in the basic, ambulatory treatment of patients than in the case of Karolina Börczová.
She's on deinfective media
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most often by means of a medical staff.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, and there are serious deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by cape infection and infection, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under home conditions.
The rooms are often filled, the beds are often very close to themselves, although patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from the epidemiological view.
As Karolina Börczová noted, however, we can also meet with the fact that in patients who are in an unstable material situation, they are confined to disinfectants, hospitals are few and patients are much more likely to increase the risk of infection.
According to Karoliny Börczová, there is a need for protection measures, similar infections are likely to be less likely to occur or other spreads may be unable to stop.
Control program against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection is for health insurance costs, and therefore it is all over the place.
For example, in England, the government has signed an MRSA prevention programme, which is related to reducing her exposure.
As seems to be, the program is successful, according to the published data, showing MRSA infection in England as a triggering trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is a series of preventions of the occurrence of multi-resistency causes of disability (including MRSA), respectively, of medical infections caused by these diseases, among their priorities.
Police captain who caused a fatal accident was not drunk
The official investigation in the case of police captain XXII, who caused a fatal accident, is complete.
It may be ruled that the police captain XXII, who died in the afternoon and who, inter alia, resigned from his duties, managed under the influence of alcohol or substance, would inform the speaker of the Vršk state representative of the capital of Attila Morva on Friday, after having completed the discovery of the case.
The investigation confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation that it had already found that the former police captain had not committed any alcohol before sitting as a volunteer.
In the meantime, the director of the police department of XXII. of the van was found in the streets of Laleose Kossutha on Tuesday in the XXII Street. The car was owned by his own personal car when he was driving a five-year-old man who entered before him when he was crossing the vehicle out of the race.
(The last known fact that the walker has crossed outside of the brain, in the end, according to the rules of road transport, is not a distressing situation, the driving driver must also give priority.)
After he was transferred to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of this incident, the chief of police withdrew from the function and requested the transfer to the service, according to a communication from the police, because he was so upset.
The investigation is carried out by the state authorities of Budapest.
Attila Morva also mentioned that the former police captain had been working with the state agents of the investigation.
Other EUR 400 million on infrastructure
The three credit frameworks agreement totalling EUR 400 million in support of schools, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy also signed on Friday in Budapest, Finance Minister Janos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 the Hungarian budget for financing projects in the transport and environment, implemented in support of the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, while the parties had already concluded a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, which is now signed on the use of existing EUR 200 million.
A credit agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance projects related to schools.
The EIB has approved for Hungary for these purposes totalling EUR 300 million, which may be later used by the remaining EUR 150 million, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which is mainly used for the research and development project of the Debrecian University.
At the meeting, there was also a word on the 4th floor.
The parties agreed that, after Hungary agreed with the EU, the financing of the metro would return to whether and how the original agreement should be amended.
According to Janose Verese, this can be achieved in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded in Hungary in 1990 a total of EUR 8.4 billion for 113 projects.
The credit card provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without obligation shall be bound to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real EU framework
The development of the Bulgarian market with real estate is exciting - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning towards a slightly forgotten Balkan country.
What, where and who are currently buying the most cheap, even fast-sustained EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-out European destination for real estate purchases is now Bulgaria with its cheap wooden apartments and houses on the sea coast.
From the top are the most in the districts of Bansko, Borovic, Pamproo and Vitoša, on the sea shores of Albena, Golden sands, Sunset coast, ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, and still more people are looking for properties around Kavarny and Balčik.
According to analysis from Re/Max Bulgaria, investors and central parts of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested people also buy in the area of the left city of Russia.
Sofie's main city is also close to easy access, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to change into one of the most attractive golf courses in Europe, and is thus facing the summer and winter season with the goal of the road and in the next two years.
Predictions of investors are already buying in large, for example around the Bank.
According to analysts, the buyer of property in Bulgaria is also trying to change his life and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more often from Romania.
There are also malt and Cyprus investors, in the Black Sea and in the forest regions there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers are going to split into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who use it buy either refurbished properties in the value of EUR 50-100 thousand, or old houses in the amount of € 5-15 thousand, which are then renovated.
They require good access and communication opportunities, and it is important for them to be close to a large city, trade and local doctor's rules.
The second category is the buyers of the chat (Bulharsko held in December among the first 10 German recreational goals).
A third group is created by commercial investors who buy in hopes of rising value in a medium- or long-term horizon.
The sale of property in the main city is inevitable because the demand is still stronger.
In Bulgaria, the lowest real estate prices in the European Union have yet to grow by 21 per cent in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6 per cent
According to the information provided by the Minister of Environment and Water Economy, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday, and the international conference on the climate regime will continue to meet ministers after 2012.
The 192 country team members and politicians from the world agree on the Bali Roadmap, which will solve the following efforts following the period of emission reduction by the Kyoto Protocol to be paid by 2012.
At this point, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States also announced that they are not currently considering the exact figures, although they agree to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 25-40 per cent by 2020 in view of the 1990 situation.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the developed country is also contributing to the provision of both material and technological assistance to the countries that are exposed to it.
The agreement also arose on grants for developing countries.
The relevant fund, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member management board, most notably under the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in Piac and Profit magazines.
Six per cent of Hungary
The Minister for Environment and Water Affairs, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to play a leading role in efforts to ensure global climate protection and to contribute to the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent of the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "Agreements after 2012" and is prepared to undertake up to 30 per cent reduction in the event that the other areas of the world will also be extended, with the resulting countries willing to accept responsibility and commitments in line with their options.
Fodor pointed out that the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had reached a decrease of 5.2 per cent, while the remaining 15 EU Member States committed to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 per cent for the years 1985-87, which our government is fully aware of. - The press report of the Ministry of Environment reminds us.
It is a lot about Bali because for two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would have been lifted by 2012. In this case, the commitment to reducing the Kyoto Protocol would never have required a new system of reduction of emissions, which, in its latest report, has also demonstrated the need for the international scientific community of the OSN, which is responsible for climate change - IPCC, which is the burden of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in average temperatures on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army is making a stand on YouTube
The British military units publish on the server to share video recordings from shares in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they themselves popularize.
First, YouTube's favorite British Air Force (RAF): Special units operating in Afghanistan have been playing video from action against Taliban since March 2006, reported BBC.
The recordings, equipped with a miniatur camera attached to the attachment, are controlled by the air force management operations in the Kandahar area and then sent to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political reporting is inevitable
This form has already gained 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers and has already seen over 75 thousand people on their "canal".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in January 2007 as "defencehead Quarters" and publishes accounts of shares in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonpeace Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Accommodation in Afghanistan
The air forces have published the video according to their original purpose for the assembly and the Ministry of Defence, and to inform the general public of the actual objective of the presence of the army abroad.
"The propaganda published in this form against traditional television advertising is almost nothing," the BBC expert on defence issues Gordon Mackenzie said, "but there is also a certain political report in itself, as the special form confirms the jurisdiction of military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that according to carefully prepared, censored recordings, the server also receives amateur videos, which captures the death of soldiers: in a few covert, "official" propaganda films, the officials are still talking about losses, yet there is no blood-threatening war.
A number of videos from the army in Iraq and Afghanistan have recently been received online, which has resulted in a great concentration, and the British army has come to them to this day.
The Americans are doing a set of things differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to catch and where the player can get through most of the faithful simulations directly into the soldiers' skin.
The ministers will spend Christmas with tombol and pajamas
The Ministry of Labour Monika Lamperth is obviously not sensitive: the holiday place provides for its employees a final working meeting, which deals with pancakes and coffee with 2007.
Some ministries will celebrate with live music, while officials will look at the summer atmosphere with a tomok and touch.
Dinner, summer atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so it's strong.
They're also preparing for Christmas.
The prime minister's wedding anniversary this year will be served by the Ministry of Defence, but it does not expect its employees to attend.
The Christmas orphans will receive gifts from children of fallen soldiers, with family members currently serving abroad, but also arrange receptions for journalists.
The resort owes 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NIF) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) shall issue a copy to other resorts.
The GKM is located in the centre of Jvő Haza, with a total of 4,320,000 Forints and of the six hundred employees of the ministry are expected to have about three hundred guests.
The resort will be held for its celebration of Christmas traditions, but it will also come to various performances and will also save tomola.
The NFU won 4,700,000 forts and held in the middle of the building of the State Justice Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the program.
I'm looking for a soul of millions of Forints, the rest was spent on more than four of them invited.
It appears that one section of the NFU is also invited to another holiday celebration: here it organises a tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from the EU money.
To that end, they found the building of the Wigsin House.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we were unable to contact the person concerned.
There's no need for a suit.
The construction of the OIT not only hosted the NFU, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which Vánoc arranged for the 7th December of St. Lucia.
However, the ILO did not want money from him to use his salts.
Five hundred people participated in the plague.
The evening began with the Minister of Health, after dinner it was possible to shut down for a live song.
According to the answer to the question of the Portal [origo] on the dance, there was no mandatory night dress or dress.
Puritan parties enjoy the resorts of health, work and local self-government.
The Ministry of Health organises a program and a celebration for employees for 400 000 Forints in their own building.
The Ministry of Labour of Monika Lamperth's employees are not even officially invited to the evening meal, not even at the final working meeting.
It is estimated that 80 guests who, according to the press release, will only get coffee and pastries, so only 350 000 Forints will be available to the party.
Minister for Local Self-Right Gordon Bainai will simply join his colleagues in the Ministry of Local Self-Rights and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a summer meeting, which awaits 436 workers in its own large hall.
The holiday party owes 2,500 Forints to guests - the total amount includes receptions with Swedish chairs and attachments.
Since that time, Minister János Veres has praised PM workers in the same way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the evening will be missing, formality does not only suppress ministerial appearances, but also the afternoon driving time.
The agricultural resort is hosted by the 20th anniversary reception, the Ministerial Holidays are not performed.
The reception takes place in the town of Vajdahunyadvár in the City of Town and according to the Ministry's statement, a total of 1,000 fortnights per person have been allocated to the guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, for which only the relevant foreign diplomats are invited in Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a short visit to the Minister of Health and end with a small visit.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of School and Culture do not even arrange dinners, sent the portal [origo] to the appropriate printing department.
The price of the summer holidays of the environment resort in the press department was not able to deliver.
In each case, four people were invited to attend the Festival at the Artekcorporation Museum.
Switches to the bottom of the stack
The Association of the Boards of Liga, respectively, of the National Trade Councils (MOSZ) shall establish its Standing Committee on the Coordination of Unlimited Rates on Friday.
On Saturday, the public meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - work will be stopped.
The action will certainly result in a serious interruption of transport, as rail transport is almost completely stopped and the employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be arrested within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Association of the League will meet with the National Council of Ministers with details jointly organised by sub-items.
It will also lead to the LIGA-MOSZ Standing Commission, which will coordinate the semi-annual action.
On Saturday, a protestal public meeting will be held, and from Monday, the committees associated with the meeting will cease to work for the time of emergency if they do not reach agreement with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike which will begin on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the committees of the Committees shall immediately proceed to the meeting.
However, if the legal regulation is rejected, the Standing Committee shall meet and decide on another procedure.
Under the afternoon agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted up until late evenings, or at night hours.
As a result of heavy traffic interruptions on the ground in the afternoon, work on the railway will be stopped during an accident, the afternoon may stop part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of Volan's company.
At the same time, it will come to many places in many countries to close half of the road.
A number of committees and civil society organisations have joined the meeting, whose list is still up-to-date on the League's websites.
Some organizations have announced a state of emergency, others have declared temporary cessation of work.
On Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Dram (MÁV) and the Independent Committee of Railway Workers (VDSZZZ) were unable to reach even enough services, and at the beginning of the summer holidays, they travel on the train with more people.
According to the information provided, from the start of the operation to 13 hours in BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in the morning in Budapest Airport, the four-year staff members of the LIGA energy industry will be elected by the Committee of Pediags and the Democratic Committee of Pediags.
The Association of Hungarian Doctors will be held throughout the country, the Democratic Committee of Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperation Forum of the Committees (SZEF), will be organized for a two-year period of emergency.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government reject the proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept to the public debate.
The second requirement is that a new method of calculating the payments shall be progressively implemented from the next year.
Thirdly, it would be possible to enter into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Committee of Railway Workers (VDSZZZ), which belongs to the Liga Group, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport relating to railways, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungary's guard increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of Jobbik Magyarszágért in August of the year, according to the Risk Analysis Division, the Political Capital Institute has now increased in a number of respects to the political risk of Hungary and the whole region.
In the "risk warning" developed by the company, it is stated that in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is that "an increase in the absence of the existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the German population of Hungary can be seen in a short time even in the midst of violent ethnic movements".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to lead to such action - it provides a research institute.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest weaknesses of Hungarian political leaders: "the public debate on the Roma issue has left representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groupings who could set up a political strategy on the Romanian-Madarian debate."
This problem deepens, hinders normal dialogue, strengthens extremism and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the court of the institute.
In addition, the work of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, has had a great impact on domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent, the image of Hungary has taken place in a foreign country, especially as regards faith in the stability of the country and its democratic growth".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-political groups, which, since late 2006, has become increasingly publicized and Vehemenence, is that in Hungary since 2007 several organizations have been created, which themselves are called "national households".
"The common dimension of these groupings is that they themselves define themselves as civil society while openly voting - and armed - the willingness of their members to carry out their defence tasks (in the case of life-threatening disasters, attacks by the authorities, violations of order), in addition to showing the incompatibility of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It also notes that this is all happening in a way that seeks to undermine the most diverse political forces based on society's resistance to politics and the parties to civil war.
Therefore, the emphasis on civility and the form of separation in the case of these acquisitions does not only serve to avoid legal registration, but it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-added factor from the perspective of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months they have shown themselves to the Hungarian Guard right now in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to apologize to their own anti-Semitarian policy.
This can all have an impact on political stability in the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the Hungarian guard in central and eastern Europe is not a single pillar, so the political risk for the region has increased as a whole.
As he writes, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
On the back of the Bulgarian guard are the massive Roman rooms that appeared in one of the Sofia Squares (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used to set up a guard with the objective of the organisation's "national homestead".
In recent 17 years, according to it, in Bulgaria, he has issued a "Cycian terror" and the state has remained an infamous and hostile state, a reminder of the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has led to a heated discussion of the Bulgarian public.
As it continues, an increase in the risk of ethnic violence signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they create their own guard on the mark of resistance.
Since the Hungarian National Guard activities show similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard activity, it is not surprising that even the Hungarians of Rome are at risk in a similar way by setting up their own home, we can learn from the risk of the political Capital institution developed.
Attila Juhász, the research director of the Political Capital Institute, pointed out that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, the risk analysis shall issue each year and, if it finds out something that might have an impact on the risk change, shall inform the public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays are not everywhere free
In Hungary, the days of freedom are precisely regulated by the law, and the practice has already become common, that throughout the holidays they move around the working days, which is waiting for us a few times in the next year.
In the European Union and in America, the parties are not united.
The Hungarian legal system is breaking down national and state holidays and working days.
The days of working rest are mainly due to church holidays or to significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a workday - in the New Year already so that people can rest after Silvestr.
During the year, we have a total of about a dozen free weddings.
The national celebration is on 15 March celebrating the 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the establishment of the State, the 1st of May, the 1st of November and the 2nd of November.
In addition, there are two-day weddings for the Grand night, the Summer and the Christmas.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays according to the calendar of holidays belong to the weekend, the practice of moving the working day has been carried out in cases where we would work just one day before or after the holiday.
The price for an extended weekend is also that we stay on the previous Saturdays at work and at school.
When we work together on the day that the contract goes forward without delay or follows it, we have been working for many years in the Minister of Labour's special statement.
The legislation applies equally to all employees and employees employed by them, to public employees and to public servants.
It shall not apply to any company and institution which are in service without interruption or in view of their appointment, even in the days of working rest.
This year will only change the working order at the end of the year: since December 24th, life in the country will stop so much, because according to the experience, most people spend days between Christmas and Silverstrem before "work" or so use the simplified permit.
In the next year, there are now several of our holidays, respectively, at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than a year.
First, the calendar changes around the holiday so that the workers can stay home after four days of work.
Saturday, 26 April will be the working day so that it can be on Friday, 2 May, at rest.
The next move relates to the Sabbath of 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, it will be replaced by Friday 24.
By the end of the year, the next year, it will be able to walk all the way in the symbol of the holidays, because since December 24th, they will have almost all the nonstop of the holiday and even though Silvestr is in the middle.
Six frightening little ones that you can hate your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we don't even realize: it's all "sustains" every day at work.
The question is, if you get used to these little discrepancy, or if you put your hands in the gloves and in the unclear situations that others may be upset, you will be careful to avoid.
I'm sorry, typy.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
That's why you're in the middle of a myth?
In a better case, he is suffering and is trying to fix it, where appropriate calls for marketing and says that he forgot to deliver the report (this is a less common solution).
The most common thing is that it's solved with one apology.
Before it comes to forgiveness, it is good to think about what you might be able to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and of course try to do so.
Are you paying for something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than being attracted to some writing, office needs, or your phone, and they're not there.
You remember you put yourself on the table last night, but it's all gone by the morning?
Or did you show up on the table of some of your colleagues who you considered to be lost?
Don't take anything from your friends without permission, otherwise they'll be able to get you into trouble with them.
Don't get away from the office of clothing or beautiful paper, because it can be unpleasant when you arrive early, and you'll need them right away.
The private life of fellows?
There's no good solution to stop spreading the holes.
Who, who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not tell every one of your news about the private lives of fellows!
If any of them were to share their secrets with you, do not abuse his trust.
And hide what you have heard, and do not hide it with your friends, even when he is aware of it and others.
You're definitely reporting your absence?
If you call the office and call for a severe headache, you will report your absence because you are not well, or you say you would rather rest today, think that your work, unskilled tasks and work that have a certain term will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know beforehand that the second day you're not going to work, or that something can happen, because you're gonna have to stay home, you're gonna complain that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence until the second day.
Use, hibernation, telephone
Did you get involved in a job you're afraid of losing your partner's mind?
You didn't want to be a witness to a telephone conversation that would be better off not even to hear?
Do not let your colleagues use it, sing it, speak it loud (it is above their head), or do it, with a constant black voice, a voice of discontent.
All of this can be destructive even when they are not confined to some project (singing, planning, organization).
You're sorry about the other one's mistakes?
If there is no time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or a message, do not blame yourself for your forgottenness!
Don't call on any chaos in your office and in your office!
Take it, if you're wrong and someone's paid for it, and make a loan!
Ask yourself how you could put things in order, make trouble!
Do you feel too much like home in the office?
Heats and shoes: comfortable clothes on the house, not even in the office!
Do not wear clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be silly, kiss your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular chess - and if that's what your profession demands, it's beautiful and elegant!
If a person wants to answer, he'll be interested
A ride in a regular early morning.
The radio calls for a special melody: the sound sounds that connects to the electronic effects.
I'm adding a vote.
The song changes the pace and adds to the previous tone of tone, then joins the women's congregation as a real clendo.
At the mr2 station, the Zagar group's firm is called Wings of Love.
Our home music life has not been a long way off with a high-quality electronic pop.
But once again, it looks quite different because you're just listening to a new Zagar album.
Yanderboie's appearances, a few new and interesting productions coming from the home digital subgroves, the whole picture changes slightly, and even though it's back in the garage rock with its milking into the guitar, and the home electropop shows that it's something new under the sun.
Ballázs Zzezer started in Píticostel, and he also played in Yonderbo's sheep, and eventually he was probably not going to go to one of the gardens - he left his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and song that connects the first train, electronic dance styles and pop, however, he began to explore when he was invited to compose film tracks (e.g.
film Ference Töröka "Szezon".
Its format, which played at the beginning of smaller clubs, was known to the wider audience after the Wan2 magazine organized their first albums in 2002 among the fifty most important domestic tenths and announced Zagar in Yonderboie's company as the only domestic development entity that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his hat are no doubt "in the course", even if no one asked them, if they were satisfied with this beauty.
Chapel responded as it is: made a new, better album.
Now published album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new roads, even though the name itself is trying to create a connection with the early years of Péticostel.
It's one version of the treasure of the darker old hats of the Balázse Zsager.
A reference to the etheric, flight would be in place, but according to the etheric purpose of this song now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of time - more louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, a song by György Liegeti, who is currently working in England with The Puzzle, was presented at the Millenáris platform in the park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the stations mr2 Petőfi, playing the last time from the morning to the evening popular music, we started to enjoy soft tunes of Wings of Love, packed with six home singers (underground Divas).
So it's all right (?)
Portal hvg.hu told Balázse Zzager.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question is, how much remains what you're playing?
Ballázs Zzáser: The definition of the musical song for me doesn't mean much.
I think there are two different boxes of easy music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be spacious, they don't say anything, and it can only happen because of sales that makes it commercial.
However, a good footing can change from proper internal needs.
In this spirit, the position adopted depends on the language and the national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the opening of the Hungarian and foreign audience against your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, there is a light song of more tradition.
There's not only teenagers and people in twenty, but also older.
Many more follow the change in the easy music that goes around them because they also consider it to be part of modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the public's role in your work?
Does it matter to you who, where and how much of your music is listening?
B. Zs.: Of course, it's good to feel that our concerts are going as far as people are concerned.
But we never did music for the market.
We're not born with a purpose, but for what reason.
The role of the public can be taken more quickly to concerts where the influence of each other is already on, but it is only hidden in the immediate changes.
Still, I realized that if a person wants to express himself to the public, he's been interested since then.
hvg.hu: How long do you want to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works alone, and he's built his career more than we're in the West.
B. Zzz.: We are actually not going his way, no matter what our music is sometimes trying to explain.
We're rather team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let it develop.
Of course, at first it wasn't going to avoid our work from making Yonderboie's savings, but a few of us were separated from his hat and set out on another trip.
hvg.hu: At the top of the station mr2 Petöfi the Wings of Love was first obtained.
Many first heard the name Zagar in connection with this treasure.
The most popular style you've ever opened with a wide variety?
B.Zs: We shouldn't have been planning to write a hit that we'd sell to.
It's more about that song.
We thought of it as a final album that we tried to release here the previous sound system and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose these six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a collective group.
Then the idea came to form this congregation with a soloist home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-year-old church - then Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, One Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which we then devoted to Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you just think of the song like this, or did the girls turn something into it?
B.Zs.: The warehouse already existed in an instrumental version, when material was collected on the desktop, we said there would be something else to do with it.
After the accords, he called for a party to join him.
That night, I was singing songs on him that girls later learned.
The whole thing was almost spontaneous and very spontaneous.
I remember how this came back to life, but of course they needed Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that energy.
hvg.hu: As on the floor, so on the concert it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing together and they're not more loud than the song, so the song just doesn't make them sing.
They're also standing behind the Jews.
You mean that?
B.Z.: The fact that they stayed behind was only because of technical problems.
That we didn't want to divide the solo role, it's rather logical.
And this is about to forget about our ego, where it belongs, and let's just leave those wheels, make love come up.
I agreed to make this euphoric attitude that we felt when this song was born, felt the other.
hvg.hu: What was the most important work with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of the song, even with one, the toughest cuts came out when moving.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play at the concert hall, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, then all of a nice little bit found his place as in some composer.
hvg.hu: Which new record is your favorite?
B.Zs.: It's always changed by the concert, even though I've already released the board.
Now it's to Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The profitable broker risked billions of dollars from the minority
It's a commercial effluent.
This is how Jeroma Kerviela, the French bank manager of the Société Generale, owner of the Turkish Commercial Bank, describes his former employee.
She's here for him, but she's a little over five billion euros.
It seems, though, that he was just a big player who wanted to get rid of his colleagues, and he was definitely not capable.
Unlike all large banking houses, there was a crisis on the American mortgage market.
"It's a lot worse," he said from the mouth of his superiors who sent the police to him.
However, as a result of the Russian declaration brought by the French media, such as the Count Le Monde, he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
In the summer, he was able to create half a billion euros on the US crisis.
The opportunity has already been felt at the beginning of the year.
In the forum, reports began to show that so-called sub-prime mortgages provided by low-performance clients or those who had problems with payment in the past will have problems.
The impact on the whole economy of this crisis had, but it shouldn't have.
He didn't believe it. He got it right.
By the end of the year, his profit had dropped to 1.6 billion euros.
"Now that I've made the first half billionaire, I didn't know how to tell it," he admits, adding that he has definitely left nothing for himself.
In the entire hearing, he admits that he lied to the records so that he wouldn't get to it.
Even the boss was able to shoot him, even when he started to take an interest in the Eurex bridge.
The risk was severe.
He's afraid he's coming to him?
I don't think so.
"I thought that the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank was comforting."
Where did he want to risk so much?
He had to work on his position gradually.
He came to the Society General in 2000 and graduated from the university in Lyon.
His annual salary moved around $11,000.
Two years later, he was already a broker, and in 2005, he became a private broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, he knew that he would never do as much as the rest of them did.
"In my first conversation in 2005, I knew they were watching me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel wrote to researchers.
But soon after his arrival, he won the first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's action, at the bombings in London, he was still half a billion euros on the ground.
And that was an exciting mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're doing it, we'll leave you.
"It's like snowball," he said to the police.
But the bosses knew all about it or more.
"As long as I made the money, my eyes were covered."
Only the morning came at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he spent billions of euros.
After midnight, he wanted to freeze.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a couple of days later that it was five billion euros for him.
And how did they get to him?
I guess it's because of my license.
"I only chose four days a year ago.
A mackerel that has no permission is a mackerel who doesn't want anyone to watch his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech Government's representatives signed nine operational programmes yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can earn 14 billion euros in the coming years (about 365 billion kroner).
It is about half of the total amount that can be obtained by Česko from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner will come from seven operational programmes to the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Innovation and Innovation Programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will lead to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds available from the CR.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be charged with a total of 90.8 billion dollars in next year.
The Innovation and Innovation Programme should serve businesses and companies to obtain funds for innovation.
Companies should receive funding for the implementation of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more efficient organisational methods.
In the delivery of funds from the EU funds, the EU's membership in the framework of the new host countries is at least successful.
Two-year sentence for the President of Nicaragua has been confirmed by the Court
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal in Nicaragua approved a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a financial fine of $100 million (meaning 1.8 billion dollars).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison on his arrest near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the head of this Central American state is sometimes returning to the network from 1997 to 2002, it is not clear by the AP agency at this time.
According to the President of the Appeals Chamber, Ileany Pérez will now be in charge of prison officials, whether they allow Germany to repay his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the German court found that he regularly transferred government money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional, and the accounts belonged to its neighbours and the closest supporters.
Some of these money then ended up in the fund that Germany based on the financing of its voluntary campaign in 2001.
So we're allowed to count.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget extraordinary?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year, Loni went through with the support of ČSSD because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not allow his rejection.
Unlike the Russian debate before the government voted in favour of mistrust, this time there was nothing dramatic.
This is traditionally considered by the Ambassador, although the most influential, law has been adopted in a calm manner.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends in individual chapters and budget positions, whether it likes or dislikes someone.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden by powerful opposition from the opposition government.
That's a little more grateful, and that's why he's paying much more attention to the media.
The demand for policies is much more interesting for the public than for the few numbers.
The state budgets in the previous social democratic governments have endured three challenges that were not able to solve at once in 2008:
The first of these is a high proportion of the laws of compulsory, e.g. mandate expenditure, which are not only pensions, but also social doses that have approved silent "coalice" ČSSD and KSCHM in the past year.
The second is poor economy as a result of the bad spirit of the first.
Thirdly, there are public finances deficits, i.e. urban and urban budget deficits.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
He's public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is a lack of city and city budget.
Many seniors, in addition to money from taxes, payments and loans from the bank, have obtained additional resources to invest, often openly paying off bonds that were not directly owed to their employees.
In recent years, they have been able to pay these debts to the mass sales of energy and other development networks that have received from the state of privatization.
They don't have this source anymore.
If we keep only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going on for many years, just like the rest of the world, a growing phase that continues to cool ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to provide public funding in order.
Instead, the state continued to earn more and more.
Other countries, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan, or Egypt, have managed far more rationally than our Republic.
It's a huge waste that falls primarily on previous governments.
We are at least at the risk of poverty among the countries that are, on a global scale, at least.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been entirely offset in recent years.
Although it has been possible to cut down some of the unintended populist expenditure, the year before the elections, so that in the near future there will not be a limit of income to pension and pension reform, then it will actually end any policy in this country and that any government will only be authorized to do so.
A little too much stress can be said that government policies become official, mechanically dividing most of the money spent on loans and social taxes.
Therefore, the annual budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the pressures of normal expenditure by mandate.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion in 2008 would be very substantial if the previous governments did not prosper over the last ten years as they could.
If we do not really want to get out of government policies to become officials alone, then we must be patient and do not resort to this strong coalitional government, which realizes that the state can only issue as much as it can get on taxes and payments, at the expense of other reform laws.
Only those can progressively achieve a balanced national budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis together in financial markets.
The exchange market will achieve more than a hundred billion dollars by auction.
In these auction banks, the interest rate of which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sent $4 billion to the auction, and four more to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time that the Central Banks of the United States agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This step has to solve the greatest economic difficulties, thus increasing the lack of free capital that banks could borrow," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers from the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 10%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already come to $60 billion because of unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billions of losses.
"Central banks need to be truly afraid of what they can still follow when they decide on this procedure," the key economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies said.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty access to loans, they will be more likely to hire their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to the recession with possible impact on the global economic growth.
The Central Banks decided after the failure to reduce the LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used to finance money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about the mutual lending of money, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain had reduced their interest rates several times.
"It will have the same effect as the next drop of interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts are not convinced that the step of central banks contributes to the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, and that is the market of property in the United States.
Klaus: Ecological debate is incredible
Global climate change is the most harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again addressed the problem of global warming.
The criticism now came to the conclusion of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Modra, never a green planet, he pointed out that the debate on the environment is incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only for the structure of the conference, which creates a remarkable mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations, but also for the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that it carries out and the reality.
"The debate is completely unstructured, it's just a flash of words that are a substitute for solving contemporary problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized that her theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed satisfaction over the fact that the book is also published in German translations, because, as he said, "I sometimes only meet with the cartoons of my views."
So now the interests can read his undisclosed existence.
Klaus pointed out that the network is not a climateist, but according to his view, it has enough assumptions to write such books.
It is also academia, capable of monitoring and considering professional meetings, has statistical experience and is also a national economy.
The main conclusion of the book was that climate change continues to change and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent view of the warming of the planet of all scientists that the consequences of these changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not represent a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are essential, ineffective and unfriendly.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totality, he is considered to be unfriendly intrusion of unexplained views, which makes him feel dangerous to restrict freedom.
He explained to the audience that it is not "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against militaristic environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver didn't want to change 600 thousand people
Six hundred thousand drivers went on for a long time and were unable to change the old driver's license, whose salary expired at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for a change so that the authorities are still able to produce a new document by the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, is not afraid that after the New Year, the driver's status would be issued on the road without payment.
According to the authorities, the licence has not changed mainly those who no longer want to run.
While citizens report a sudden decline in interest in the exchange of drivers, the authorities in the metropolis are satisfied with requests and interest in the exchange of evidence increased this week.
The Magistrate gives about 2,000 customers a day.
There's a half-hour noise waiting in front of the front.
In Prague, the driving licence has not changed the volume of 120,000 drivers.
It takes twenty days to set up a new show.
But it's possible to ask for the release in the short five-day period.
In such a case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who are obliged to exchange the exhibition will not reach the end of the year and go on the road without a pay driver will be threatened by a cold test.
The prosecutor will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But the police can solve the obstacle, too.
In the case of an administrative procedure, the test shall be applied to 2500 kroner.
According to earlier information, he could have obtained a visit from a worker and a person who would not go anywhere.
He could even pay $30,000 in cash.
In the past, the Ministry has called on the authorities to be peaceful and to have the highest number of thousands of prisoners.
According to the Ministry of Communication, Karl Hanzelky's tenets are not threatening anyone.
The guide is based on the evidence that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a public statement that every person has to pay.
People who don't want to run any more to get a driver's license.
It shall be sufficient to carry it or to send a recommendation to the competent public authority.
At the end of the year, the checks issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be paid.
Motorists, however, must gradually change other types of driving instructions.
People with evidence from 1994 to 2000 are still three more years old.
The amount of evidence issued between 2001 and 2004 shall be completed in December 2013.
According to Hanzelky, it's about 2.6 million more evidence.
The Court reduced the penalties for detectives associated with Berdyche.
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konyřík, who have been convicted of criminal association with David Berdych, go to prison for thirty and ten years.
With the definitive penalty, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce their punishments, one year and another two years.
It initially threatened the Prussian Committee's detectives for fighting organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
Against today's decision, it can no longer be dismissed, it can only be allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also sorry for this cause, but he's waiting for the first stage.
In other processes, however, they have already been punished in the account of over 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the National Court recognized in particular the participation of 19 people who were found guilty of fraud, and today the Supreme Court ruled 16 of them.
Most of the alleged complaints have declined since the investigation began with the fact that they were involved in the construction of the case.
According to the Intermediate Meeting, police officers, in addition to the agreement with Berdyche, transmitted information to criminals from the police sources, covered individual policing and helped the gang members avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave it 30 percent for Opava and Conyre.
The complaint concerns the criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the abuse of the rights of public workers and the abuse of unauthorized weapons of many victims of serious health care.
During domestic visits, the same police identified illegal weapons, fires with steel core, laser detectors, or planes.
Gang, according to the charge, came with a dozen million crowns.
In addition, two hundred men in this process have been legally recognized by the courts by the rest of the Berdys and by a number of others.
Other men in the area of Berdycha still speak before the court in another trial, some of the charges have not yet been filed before the court.
The main link has yet been avoided by Thomas Potto and Maroshi Šulej, who live in the Irish occupation, where they are waiting for a final decision on their departure to the Czech Republic.
Number of child replacements: 12 million
In exchange for children in the family, the lawyer of the injured family Igor Veleba, after the threeties hospital, wants to pay 12 million crowns, plus court charges.
For each of the mothers by three million, for fathers by two million and for children by one million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 for every parent.
The legal representative of the Ondréj Hospital is therefore not in agreement with Veleby's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," said the achievel after today's meeting.
"But in order to make an opinion on this anti-infection, we need a finding trial that the opponent left to work.
We'll find out if he's even got the talking value.
But we keep in mind that it will be in statistics for everyone," said Doyle.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of her family's case, Jablon's family wanted every month when she didn't raise her biological daughter, millions of dollars.
He served as a foundation for the settlement of the compensation for the damage suffered by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychologists, endured psychological stress and stress in various stages and deep.
The stress situation was better for men, even though they had been exposed to reports that replacements of newborns had not been prevented.
Women are also worse compared with the current past trauma and what's happening right now, the contents of Veleba.
Veronica and Nikol exchanged health care for their family on Monday, 9 December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Czech Republic and Veronica to Libor Brojo and Jaroslav Trojan to Jablon.
Hejtman Essochiy Miloš Vistrčil passed out at the end of October each of the 100,000 crowns to pay for the expenses that resulted from the lack of the emergency hospital that the country is experiencing.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are guaranteed by the law on liability for damage.
In the event of an error, they must be transferred to the reserve fund, and they can only request assistance from the organizer.
The courts have long recognized a relatively low level of damage, sums have been calculated according to the table in a number of statistics, except for millions of crowns.
Polivka came about the kingdom of the Valais
Bolek Polívka has won a contest on the sign of the Kingdom of Valais.
According to the Ostravian Court of the Network, he first used the appointment of the king of Valais, but the project had built a long-term work for the team around Tomáše Harabiš, who worked with the priest.
The pool didn't take part in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client is calling back.
"The idea is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are taking a stand on the Bolka Polivky," said the Polish lawyer after the trial.
According to him, all of the words of the Kingdom of the Valais will produce just a priest and a comedian.
He's got the same attitude as Harabish.
"It's about ten years behind us.
Collecting money and thinking of action," he said.
According to him, there's a problem with money.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something from it.
They want to stop our work," he added.
Lukravitic bison
According to the ruling, the Valais King first used Polivka in his television series.
In 1993, she was crowned here by Radoslav Brzobohetý.
But it did not, however, depend on the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Haribish came with the idea of producing whale passports.
The original regressive action included trade and lucrative business activities, which Haribish then referred to the establishment of the company of the Kingdom of Valais.
In 1997 Polívka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in passports and even offered to their supporters the discounts when visiting his farm and the divadial exhibitions.
Who's sitting on the throne?
Today's court also indicated that Harabiš used only the holo idea that Polivka had published in the mines for his business purpose.
"Populati Boleslava Polivky's project of the Valais kingdom has certainly helped," the judge said.
But he added that the soul project was Haribish and his team, who were committed to him.
The collaboration of today’s corrupted parties continued until 2000, when Haribish organized an official coronation in the University of Bolivia.
From that time on, however, the conflict between Polívk and Haribish began to gather, which led to the formation of the "King of Boleslav I. selected for the furt".
The leading role in the kingdom was then played by the singer Jarmila Shulákė as the queen's mother on the bottom of Harabiše.
In 2002, Polívka appealed to Harabiš and his company to the court today.
Clearly, Harabish could bring a clear complaint about the throne and half the princess.
He should go out with a new king.
He still didn't want the details and the term.
"We don't want anything to work out.
It should be something like a king's ride to Slovakia.
The king should be called for a certain time.
And Mr. Polivka can quietly report," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: cross-references
Actually, I've never missed Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not strong, the quality of sorting, handling, and also the products would be easily identified by means.
But now there's Peugeot 207 on the market, and that's much better.
And the truck called SW is still about the shirt, and it doesn't bother me to think better.
When I was testing classic hackback Peugeot 207, for example, I got stuck on the head of the back seat.
This is already the end of the problem, because the truck driver means that in this direction there will be no length of two metres.
A World Year
I'm going through very quickly so I can't get back.
It's about the entire design that I've got a single exit to the poor middle tunnel.
Here, I would appreciate a little more designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and they're there for the time when we could get on the short seats or run.
The side direction also significantly improved against model 206.
As far as the space is concerned, it's also here to feel the increase in the size of the carozer.
In the van, there's already a mentioned lack of space on the head.
Cuffs and cucumbers
That's the main driver of this car, so he's his driver.
I have to assess this as very well available (and also thanks to the opening of the rear window) and as a very consistent one.
Sound spaces are equipped with durable rubber, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't stop, it can break down and it keeps more heavy objects.
But let's get together on the subject.
This is based on Table 428 l, which is more than the average value against competition.
However, not against the Czechest car of this class - the Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to a new generation of young people's product, then we'll find that Peugeot is left with a very well-known 52 litres.
This value shall be as critical as possible to a foreign country or when placing a stamp.
But if I'm going to win the favor, I still have to mention the whole equal position after the second round or a very low right.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested vehicle was equipped with a load four-performer with an output of 1.6 l of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, it's supposed to look like a six-year-old who's raising a family hackback.
He's quiet, he's having a little consumption and, above all, he's breathing.
If I compare her to a harmful period that seems to move slowly as if she's having a lacquery in the air, then I can only be overcrowded with her.
The price of the contract
The price of the car is not human.
We must remember, however, that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good motor.
The basic price of the vehicle with a load of 329 900 Kč is still rising.
Our aggregates are 410 900 Kč, which is enough already.
Tested Premium equipment then comes with equipment for another 80,000 Kč proposals.
Only we still had major airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic firefighting, electric power control of the back windows...
It's just that the train is all over 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but count the extra equipment in Fabie and you'll get to a lot of the same number.
So he doesn't have to decide for the mark.
The integration of Slovenian schools into British schools is not possible
The British schools have children from Eastern Europe, which causes local residents to worry about further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europe is still under attack on a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases when disputes between immigrants and children of native citizens persist in violence.
The problem with integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants begin to arise.
The gloves, gloves, and gloves between the teeth were also transferred to the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovenian woman who was a teenager of ten years of age.
She's been threatened by the boy's assault on her with racist threats.
The police had to arrest two innocent girls after the attack on the Slovenian passenger.
The young men had a reputation for their racist remarks, and they had cast rocks on him.
"When we went home, a boy jumped onto a bus stop and started to swim on us.
When I told him to let it go, he threw himself on us apples and vegetables, and then left his behind," she wrote another unpleasant occasion for The Times' mother of Slovenian apples.
The difficulties are on both sides.
One of the local sittings even marked disputes with passengers from Eastern Europe for the struggle to survive.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere at British schools between locals and visitors begins to be heated.
In Britain, there are 70 thousand Slovaks who have been assigned to work here.
A total of 30,000 Slovenian students then visit British schools.
Cheapest islands of the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your permission, it can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fish.
Palmy and all inclusive with figures offered on the beach pizza, ice cream and bitter cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf course.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find it in full and even more rich numbers.
Only on one island, but you will find more and more and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antils.
For the Spanish, Cuba was very proud of their American achievements.
Columbus identified her as the most beautiful place ever seen by the human eye.
Havan became a warehouse and a translator of the funds that Spanish people in the Americas purchased and transferred to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel National grew up at the same end of the 20th year.
He allowed him to be one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for bans) was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havan, the tall houses grew, and after the broad hills, a car was built that belonged to the cultural symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a seat in San Francisco de Paula, a cousin from Havana, and he had his jacket in Cojemar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio left their signatures of the stars of the showbusinness and politics from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in the Havan Bodeguit.
At the bar of the precious National hotel they buy you a cocktail for your invitation.
And this 50th - year - old cult car is traveling along Havana for a long time, because once brought with it a long time ago, it was buried in the sandy and windy air.
Being Havana, especially her oldest part, is significantly remembered, although there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments around it, as it is right there.
Other places also change into beauty, maybe Trinidad.
Given the fact that road traffic brings so much money, its development is green.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varaderu, in the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another libel, which is unique in the world and is especially valued by trainers.
A third of the exposed plants were attached to the sugarcane after the hard-to-dried pairs and motor trains.
Their train park hasn't been renewed for decades, and that's how they've been seeing the operating machines that have been in museums.
Where are you going?
This most famous place of the most visitors is Kuby.
And so about Varader, or Havana, you don't have to write too much.
It may be recalled that in the Hemingway settlements mentioned above, the museum is a museum and anyone who likes this writer should not be allowed to visit.
The Valley of Vinjales One of the smallest villages of Cuba is the valley of Vinjales in the west of the island.
The green vegetation grows from the fencing floor.
The potentials, fencing homoleum and rock are strongly shaken from the bottom of the valley, and in their buildings, the fertile land has been captured, thanks to which the windy rocks are also covered with heavy rains.
It's a place where the best Cuban tobacco can be grown.
With its final form, you can meet if you visit some of the Havan factory for the manufacture of dolls.
Maybe someone's going to be interested, and that's what happened to Major Landman's Chilean work there.
Trinidad
The old town that was established shortly after the Spanish colonized the islands.
Glory and riches brought him trade with children and sugar.
The wealth has turned into the beauty and appearance of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which is highly influenced by later French scholars, has not changed in almost four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray, is so remote that in the last 50 years, there was no road that would be connected to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
There was nothing there, and that's why there was nothing fighting, everyone was happy that he had an arrow on his head.
If a person has more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then they are also looking at it at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Play Ancón beach, or the Gulf of Sugar.
The evening, then, is to go to Casa de la Música, who lives after the meeting and sings in it over the morning.
Baracoa
The town on the very east coast of Cuba is some of the fastest on the island.
Such an attitude is already affecting the road itself.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo have to overcome the heights and members of the mountains and pass through the nature of which the human activity has almost failed.
The Cuba's outer exhibition was written by UNESCO thanks to a darkly undisputed nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate, in the church they have Columb’s cross (in fact it took about a hundred years after the Columb River) and from the hill where some buildings are located and the El Castillo Hotel is today, it is a sighting of several chair mountains, one of which is the most famous El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, showers, on the Sierra Maester hill, on the Fifth Isla de Pinos Island and on the Tropican Cabaret, on the Holy Cuban patron of Caridad del Cobre, on the Santeria, African religions that recognize the descendants of some children, it would be possible to describe a lot of pages.
It's better to see it once.
Afghanistan's allies are passive, American claims.
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment affect the United States of America during the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO would have to plan a specific plan for the next year, according to Defence Minister Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan is not tested according to the presentation, representatives of countries in the Scottish Edinburgh region, which have units in the southern part of the country.
According to the growing opposition by the Taliban, today eight participating States are also discussing other allies' plans and coordination.
While the United States, through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, called NATO units for increased activity this week, Great Britain sees a priority in strengthening the authorities of the Afghan Government and strengthening development assistance.
"Violence in Afghanistan is imaginative, but military force can only be a part of the solution.
This is another opportunity for citizens to start further economic and security development on their own," the BBC Department of Defence Des Browne said.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels is said to be the highest in the last five years, according to the U.S. Army data.
The number of violent acts dropped by 27 per cent last year, in the southern province of Helmand up to 60 per cent.
NATO has a total of 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, from which a quarter of its territory is south.
According to the United States, however, the associations achieved their own limits in the organization and the equipment unit.
In particular, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar way today, NATO General Jaap de Hoop also spoke.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we need," said Reuters De Hoop at the end of the class talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
Among the countries involved in the last few months, there are also disputes as to whether all associations take the lead in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for passiveism.
"The Germans have relatively large representations in Afghanistan.
But they are found in areas where there are at least violence and the weapons of war are not as high as we are in the south and east parts of the country," Gates said.
The British Blue Book of Sun marked German soldiers for the lions this week.
"Afghan's players are out: Germans are playing while our enemies are fighting," Sun wrote in a material filled with pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image moved into the counter and took a picture of the British unit at the strike strike in southern Afghanistan.
State debt is charged to billion in 2009
On each Czech side, there is a state debt of over 84,000 kroner.
The total debt went down to the end of a total of 842.7 billion dollars.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion dollars a year.
At the beginning of the year, the ministry has reduced its plan to 152.8 billion kroner by improving the economic development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic reached the end of September at 842.7 billion dollars.
In nine months of the year, it grew by 40.2 billion.
Since June, he's been down by 13.4 billion dollars.
The Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on State debt since the beginning of October.
Each Czech is worth more than 84,000 crowns.
For the entire London year, the state owed more than 111 billion dollars.
"In the meantime it seems that due to the lower deficit for the next year, we could cross the limit of a billion crown by 2009.
The next year it would take a debt to move between 900 billion and a billion crown," he introduced to the iHNed.cz server analytic Patria Finance David Marek.
It is similar to the analysis Next Finance Vladimir Pikoro: "To exceed one billion we could get through 2009.
When it's going to depend on the next budget that we don't know yet.
If it were to show that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to draw more attention to it in 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Move Right
The State debt creates the central government's debt and results in, in particular, the cumulation of the State budget's wages.
The State debt is financed by depositary instructions, national bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has already risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion dollars a year.
The foreign debt of the country increased by 1.7 billion dollars to 123.3 billion dollars a year.
The so-called commercial state debt at the end of the summer reached 803.3 billion kroner and from the red cliché of 13.7 billion kroner.
The average amount of State debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total debt per year for the first to third quarter grew by 13 per cent, which is really a lot on how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is mainly generated in long-term accounts, where growth is 20 per cent.
It's bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it shows that it's going to deal with as long as the debt reform is here," Piko said data.
Better than expected
The 2007 State debt financing and management strategy reveals that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion dollars a year.
At the beginning of the year, the ministry has reduced its plan to 152.8 billion kroner by improving the economic development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly due to the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroner instead of the estimated 91.3 billion kroner.
There is also a planned maximum resource for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion-billion-dollar reserve for payment of debts, financing of State debt for 43 billion kroner and payments from the European Investment Bank over 1.8 billion kroner.
A woman has to be brought to court in the Charter today because she gave the name of the floating bear.
The British teacher, who was in Sudan for Islam's rape, was sentenced on Thursday night by one of the Court's judges to fifteen days in prison and was sentenced, as her lawyer suggested.
The British was accused of leaving six to seven years of complaints to the false bear's name Mohamed despite the fact that any screening of the prophet Islam is prohibited.
It was a detailed punishment for the wound wound.
This British four-year-old teacher, who was at the Union High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested on Sunday at home and accused of assaults on Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after which several complaints were lodged in the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact in the month of September when the student in question asks his six to seven-year-old to choose a name for a third-year-old pigeon.
"From the children's mouth are eight names, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," reports school director Robert Boulus.
After the vote in the class, 20 of the 23 children finally choose as the favorite name Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread Christian name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for their class with a photo of the bear, which was written by "My name is Mohamed".
He had no shield on his own with that name, but he was in the very background of the prophet considered to be a sign of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, convinced her that she knows well and that she would never do anything harmful to any religious faith: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for some name," he says only about "unrequired mistakes".
Such a view is shared by many tears teachers who describe it as "very careful to their tears" and add that "never in class does not speak about religion".
Let us remember that the Christian name Mohamed is also the second most commonly used Christian name in Britain, in English, four different ways.
This Christian name often chosen by Muslim families represents the way in which to teach the prophet (often done with the original).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them toys?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
At the last stage of the settlement in Vienna, they failed to reach agreement on the future status of the province.
I've finally failed.
The Serbs and Kosovos of Albania ended in the middle of the morning in the 6th and also the last round of talks, without which they were able to overcome the different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is politically appropriate that both parties were unable to reach agreement on the status agreement," said European co-ordinator Wolfgang Ischinger at the press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, pointed out that peace in the area is "in the shadow" and appealed to Bélehrad and Pristina to maintain peace and be ready for dialogue after the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, however, enter into the period of emergency," he added, "it is evident that the situation is tense."
Meeting at the end of 10 December
Directors of the Troika, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, shall be sent to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 per cent of Albanian speaking population is created, could be shown in a clearer light until December 10th, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian co-ordinator Alexander Bocan-Charcenko have to issue their report to the UN Security Council.
Discussions in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent six and at the same time the last round of interpretation since the UN, in August of this year, Trojk believed in the new resolution.
The Americans and the Europeans are counting on the end of the talks on 10 December.
Russians, who had previously blocked the independence of Kosovo by the UN Security Council, continue to continue the negotiations after this most recent period.
"Russia was and remains forced to resolve the common, compromise solution," Bocan-Charčenko said.
A single declaration of independence?
After eight years of management of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the EU's supervision for a single solution.
Priština states that in the event that the Security Council is not decisive in its support, it is prepared to declare independence on the one hand.
Bellehrad takes on extended autonomy.
"Please, we have not reached any agreement," declared President Fatmir Sejdiu of Kosovo's self-government in a research hotel, where this "last chance meeting" has been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former rebel leader of Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the plans of autonomy presented by the Belgrade "are relevant to the past leading to the murders and deportations".
"Dominic effect"
On the contrary, Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise is still taking into account and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the alleged unilateral independence of the province.
Beléhrid is particularly concerned with the "domain effect" in the area which is still unstable due to the war for independence in the 1990s.
"It doesn't matter to Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
In the next day, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be of the Security Council, in which its Russian Federation has the right to vote.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, the only solution that comes from the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the basis of the Security Council."
Newspapers Fatmir Sedjius replied that "the last word of the status will have a Kosovo parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence was made by Albanian speaking citizens, "after agreement" would be made with the West.
Bush on the Israelis and the Palestinians rejected the agreement
At the beginning of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis in Maryland, welcomed by his people, American President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbás agreed at the moment of meeting with the intention to always resolve the ongoing conflict between the two nations for 60 years.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestine must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end with colonial activities, Bush announced and reminded of the obligations that both sides have to fly from "road maps" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House pointed out that the meeting between Israel and Palestine's rule of self-government led by Abbas is aimed at "the conclusion of a peace treaty that would solve all the unsolved issues without exception, including the central issue".
This statement contains three questions that are in the core of the dispute between Israel and Palestine: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the judgment of the Arab remnants who were spared in the war in 1948 from their homes in the territory of the State of Israel today.
Abbas quoted the words after the American President and insisted that the next meeting be "sound and thorough" and that it touch all aspects of the solution, with the mention of "Jerusalem, the coast, the border, the colony, the water, security, except for others".
Then Olmert, who expressed his opinion that the subsequent settlement should be "precise and continuous" and that it should be "dependable to be closed during 2008.
Bush defined by the end of 2008 as the term of implementation of his "two-State vision", of the Palestinian and Israeli people who are next to him.
Saudi Arabia has expressed its commitment to that end even before it decided to take part in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is successful in Washington, launched a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which Israel offers peace for the release of all Arab territories prohibited for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis stands for "the crisis in the Middle East in particular because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", the judge of Prince Saúd in an interview, which provided an Arabic speech debt protected by the Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible.
What happened on Sunday?
As it is always in such small messages from the black chronicle, official versions do not agree with what is said between people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French State Police Inspectorate General de la Police Nationale (IGPN), the police car went on Sunday shortly after 17 hours on Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villaries-le-Bel.
"The air was not in storage mode, but was on the monitor and passed at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, there was no sidelight,” explains the police source.
A green motorcycle character Kawasaki, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to drive to public communications" (read below), driven by two young people without touching, went "very high speed".
"Motocycle killed from the left side to the police car after he didn't take the lead in the investigation," said one policeman.
The blood flow tests performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The state of the car (expressed front door, broken front door, flat tires) testifies to the accuracy of the tire.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry was very quick to respond to the investigation by IGPN last morning that "indiscriminate killings and non-performing assistance to persons at risk" were also involved in the direction of the department de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (National Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor indicated that the investigation carried out by the IGPN excludes police responsibility at this stage.
Three witnesses who had a detailed hearing on Sunday evening, said the official confirmed "the police's version, although the minimotor approached him relatively quickly on the left".
Like the rain, undoubtedly caused by the earthquake on the ground, yesterday showed that both vehicles remained locked up until the police car found out to be stolen.
The vehicles were secured and passed by a technical expert.
Both victims had a drink last night.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday in Williers-le-Bel, people were quick to talk about the police should quickly leave the scene without giving two young people the first help.
In all respects, IGPN should also issue "any serious charge" in this paragraph.
"It is the most important aspect of the investigation, which requires more attention and should be very careful with it," the police source said.
The "Liberation" dinner met with a blind witness to those who followed after the accident.
One of his eyes, then, leads right where the accident took place.
"At the same time, we are together with a nurse who is a health nurse in the hospital, sitting down to try to get them up," the witness reports.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he looked at a full-fledged cop.
Two others tried to get one of the young people up and the fourth talk on the phone."
Faces in the face of fast growing tension and the certainty that the situation of young people is hopeless were the police escorts of colleagues who, inter alia, reached the site.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left."
They've also done a heart massage, but shit.
"Let no one deny that police authorities have not come to help young people.
This young man was given first aid.
The hackers came right away.
For their rescue, everything was done," the prosecutor pointed out.
Insects in Pakistan
The Pakistani police in the afternoon called for the first demonstration from the statement of the extraordinary status of General Mustaraf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, in the eastern part of the country, about 2000 lawyers who demonstrated their resistance to measures taken under an exceptional condition were injured by a low flood, which, according to the witnesses, used regular force.
The last name was answered by a stone that hurt several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios like Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
A few of them should be called.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court's lawyers called after the general judge and announced demonstrations, resulting in about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The approach to the Supreme Court was delayed on Monday morning, with a view to preventing the assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (north West).
On Monday, a delegation of lawmakers supported the political alliance of Muttahida Mailis-e-Amal, whose president "supplyed the population to strengthen the flowers of the judges who stood against the exceptional situation, and the resignation of those who made a commitment before Musharaf".
"Musharaf's word doesn't pay"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly within the scope of the extraordinary measure stated on Saturday evening.
The next day he had to make a statement on the legality of the reinstatement of President Mustaraf in an informal presidential election that took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was removed and repatriated.
"All we are witnesses is anti-violence, anti-violence and against the Supreme Court," declared the officer in The News.
Mr Parvize Musharafa said that he was referring to the conduct of the army and became a civil president, "not paying" after the release of an exceptional status, the Minister of Information Tariq Azem announced on Monday.
Military uniforms were expected to appear until 15 November when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that summer elections could be suspended.
The Pakistani government has also issued a permanent speculation that the head of the army should order the President of Musharaf's home prison.
More than a third of the pregnancy remains unexpected.
This proposal includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %) as well as badly planned or occurring in an unexpected way.
More than one third (36%) is still unexpected today, the study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études demographiciques (Ined)- The National Institute of Demographic Studies, four years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which was enacted in France.
This proposal includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %) as well as badly planned or occurring in an unexpected way.
The various methods of anticonceptives with hormonal anticonception or sterilisation still show 5% to 6% of failure, recommends Ined.
The anti-concept legislation, however, only made it possible to improve the "control of fertility" of the Constitution and notes that the rate of use of hormonal anti-concept in women between 20 and 44 years has risen from 5 % in 1970 to 60 % today.
Finally, eight out of ten children today are well planned.
One couple of five has even been counted for a month and if possible for a year which is considered as the most suitable year for the birth of a child.
Assessive repair of the space station
More than seven hours of work in the universe required astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to the remarkable equipment of the spaced solar panel needed for further scientific operation of the station.
The risk approach to the space that collected records for the length of duration, distance from the usual modules, speed with which it was planned and the measurements of the "cultivity" that the astronomers had set up to correct.
The problems appeared in the afternoon, while the astronomers from the Discovery ship set out the Harmony module, a large war attack designed to install the European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see frame).
This module is any input request for module laboratory.
But you need the power to save electricity.
The second task of the mission was therefore to move the seven-tenth-tenth power-generating module through solar panels already located on the ISS, so that it can move to its final location.
After moving it, the crew began to rent seventy-five meters of solar panels of the module.
And in that there was one of the panels, which appeared as a fitting harmony, resulting in the attaching of the cable, damaged on the floor without a few meters.
The resolution was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally to carry out the control exit on the Discovery ship and then to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had failed were forced to pay off the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski, who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic edge of the ship, attached to the station's frame, and did the right thing.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" of the U.S. Aviation and Space Authority (NASA).
High, static, very attractive, has a very well-formed chest and long care.
In his 46 years, this initial call was entrusted to the doctor to "oppose" a "damaged" solar panel.
After a detailed investigation of the damage, he cut off the lead cable and placed it in damaged places, such as "darks".
He helped him a second spacewalker, who stayed close to the matching chamber, and also inside, the other astronomers, among them Peggy Witson, the master crew.
The devices that he used, including the minihoke, were designed by an insulation device to prevent the electroscopic on solar panels producing several hundred volts, found and made astronauts on the floor of the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski expected that the panel would be fully disbanded and then synthesized his orders and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronomers used half a day's rest before the day when seven astronomers were returning to the Discovery ship to return to the center, as planned.
EADS actions weaken
The EADS shares are significantly lost at the Paris bridge, after the company operating in the aviation and defence industry announced that it will have to lose 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros in order to reduce the delay of flight A400M.
EADS has lost 4 % and is now on the Paris bridge to EUR 21.96.
The financial group was required to assess its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays in the low-performance procedure for the development of the A400M engine, which is the condition of the landing year.
The price for the delay in the supplies of a military cost flight, announced in October, was calculated "from 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion euros, from more than billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European constructor EADS.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be required, on Thursday, to present its quarterly results, to report a new view of the profit before the calculation of the interest and tax (EBIT).
The Group also found that the new cost recovery corresponds to six months' delay.
Let us note that the production results of EADS in 2006 fell by 86 %, particularly because of the costs associated with the delay of the other programme, which is at the end of the year A380.
The group originally assumed that the first supply of A400M would be provided by the French army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
The Sunday elections will be held without undue expectations: Russia's majority is elected by President Putin, the United Russia.
Assuming, after the end, only a very few free-of-charge campaign, their commitment to stability, to the authority.
Today, three days before the elections to the parliamentary chamber, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends voters to public stations with a television message, but its content is kept secret.
It acts in the position of the leader of the United Kingdom, the pro-progress party, who, according to all, celebrates the victory of the wild beast.
When he received an explanation from foreign states yesterday, the president left nothing open to him and settled with another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, and we are proud of what may be the most transparent and fairest will, the free will to the beauty," he added.
It's not like that in the eyes of the opposition.
They remove the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennadaj Zjuganov says that "they've never been such a dirty volition, not for Jelcina."
After the repression of the demonstrations from last weekend, former world minister Gary Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, continues to receive a visit, according to his lawyers.
"The Russians have remained the mental homo soviet."
In the background of these parliamentary elections, two further open-ended questions are identified:
- "Who will become Putin's representative in the presidential office?
The Official Journal of the European Union published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates may be present by 23 December.
Vladimír Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot force a third term in row.
However, no tracer will appear.
- "What role will Putin play in the summer?"
Will we be the first?
Or the head of the Parliamentary majority and the powerful parties of the United Russia who choose the government and the president?
Whether that is the case or not, the coming power is welcome throughout Parliament as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have remained a mental homo sovietica, not feeling the lord of their judgment," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The history of Nikolaj Kopossov of the State University in Sankt-Peterburg is a long-standing relationship: civil society, in this country, surrounded by five centuries after Europe, is late; it is the famous spirit of society that has led to the creation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin referred to the state's patriarchal model, perfectly accepted by the citizens, more than that this new patriarchalism did not carry out terror, but a certain economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman of Carnegie's award.
The Russians today are "supply to personal responsibility", which they have recently demonstrated after the SSSR crash.
"What do you think?"
This phenomenon concerns all types of society, including the commercial world.
The official elite shall also be able to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of the total number of 85 heads of Russian regions) conduct the local candidates of the United Kingdom.
The new freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, a sonic chaos.
Public changes give priority to stability.
Also, in the name of stability, Russia will not vote for extremists.
Close Tamary Cherednikko, four-year-old professors: "What do you think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why should they change?"
Synchronising folder
After more than sixty years in a reliable regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which represent the judgment of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open to the public.
47 million archive documents placed 27 km long in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were available only for the "human" purpose, which means individually and by name, at the request of the victims or their legal persons.
Eleven States trusted in the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open them to scientists and historians in May.
In view of the fact that the ratification process of this agreement is in the end for all States, opening yesterday has been effective.
Other information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen allows you to explore "especially the transfer of prisons, the population of camps and the health status of workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives led by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICCR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have been opposed to access to these so-called public documents because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What is homosexuality or mental achievement of some victims of deportation are supposed to be.
After the war, the registers of concentration camps or trailers of the Gestapo were gathered for a practical purpose to find the deported or forced work of the civilian population, to provide evidence of their international activities with a view to opening the way for their damages.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen still have dozens of individual applications.
However, for the part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
"There can be nothing more to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Antisemitism of Berlin Technische University in 2006.
The EU and India want to conclude free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India has reached a minimum of 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is listed as India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
In 2008, the European Union and India expected the signing of a free trade treaty, announced the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In the autumn of last year, EU foreign ministers gave the Green European Commission a meeting to sign free trade agreements (agreements de libre exchange, ALE) with India, South Korea and with the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is listed as India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, up to nine EU trading partners.
"The Free Trade Agreement greatly enhances both economies" and "India is gaining better access to the 450 million prospering European markets," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, and the European Commissioner, the Asian and European giant, together with the annual shift of "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", announced this week by Daniel Smadja, head of the European Commission in New Delhi, saying that bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its full potential". The EU and India meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, to be attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Durao Barrosy.

The English bank took into account the concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-day auction
On Thursday, the English bank pointed out that it was in order to reduce the current concerns about the deterioration of the credit market conditions and announced a 10-billion-free tender in a five-day auction for a basic rate of 5.75 %, the tender was not normally paid long.
"You are trying to ease my concern that the conditions on the financial markets will be very unacceptable at the end of the year and give banks greater security in the way to ensure their readiness for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant share of its planned reserves during the maintenance period which will begin on 6 December in the form of a five-day operation on the open market," she said in a communiqué.
The Bank concludes that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January at the basic rate.
It seems to be the first to push BOE on the financial market to prepare for the five-day operation on the open market.
They usually last a week.
BOE adds in its communiqué that "keeps ready to take other measures to maintain inter-bank interest rates" at the same level with its basic rate.
The average interbank interest rate was 5,829 %.
The average monthly interest rate was 6,6 %, which is the highest number since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the annual financial crisis, amounts have been placed on the financial market of the Bank of England related to the payments made by the banks since the use of this offer.
According to certain speculative speculatives of the strengthened exchange rate for the euro, many prefer decisions have been made for sums placed on the financial market of the European Central Bank with lower rates and more promising discrepancy.
UMP (Union pour un movement popular, Union for Human Rights) and NC (Newveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to reject socialists' (PS) proposals on buying-in.
The UMPs and the New certainly Centre refused to discuss on Thursday the individual sections of the Socialist proposal of the law on subsidiarity, which is equal to the suspension of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the proposed law was obtained within the framework of a socialist "ship" (the meeting initiated by the individual sending club) and contained a tenth of the measures taken in the Internal Bureau of the PS, including an increase in employment premium of 50 %, the renewal of TIPPs, a transport check or a rental regulation.
In view of the fact that the UMP and the NC voted against the statement of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general report, which was an opportunity for a change of opinion, sometimes more lively, between majority and opposition, hours before the television release of Nicolase Sarkozy on purchasing.
The Head of the PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would re-submitted these proposals in their capacity in addition to the amending proposal of the Financial Act, which would be scheduled for the next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of a lot of speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia holds a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the Republic of Great Britain's director Melvina Benna Festival.
"For our company, it's a pleasure to work with a man who inspired a contemporary festival nest in America without any oversimplification," Charlie Jones from the C3 server Billboard.com said.
C3 manufactures the skiing festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is an annual camp target.
The festival should run from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres, approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festival organizers.
In 1989, Cormidal Reading Festival was held in the United Kingdom, which annually reaches 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, then in 2006 the Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a partner, also has the age of production, license and organizational duties at the Glastonbury Festival, which has a capacity of up to 177,500 people today.
Charlie Jones of C3 describes Glastonbury as "the most exciting event" he has ever experienced and says his company and company Melvina are working together to give the region a festival event of European style.
"We initially chose Philadelphia as a market and worked hard together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to establish a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I was with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by the project.
However, because of the current leadership of the city, we have failed to go to politics, says Charlie Jones.
"We were lucky to have the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we want to set up a great festival in an extraordinary place that will result in serving the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 founded the Lollapalooza Festival in the Chichiagsk Grant Park, which was held at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross market for the year 2007 was $9,8M and $11,3M.
Both of these festivals are held in the city center.
"The European festival model Melvina Benna plays outdoors, while our festivals go on green streets," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to include in a certain way both meals so that we can create the home of a foreign festival after Europe and the city after America."
Vineland is located on half the road between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"In addition to Vineland, including the elderly, it supports the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last-named refusal to create the terms of the agreement, however, claims that "they are sufficiently useful to allow them to invest in such events and welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, long-term duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", like the capacity of Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee, which is estimated to be 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already sent invitations, but nothing can be confirmed at the moment the program is just in the press.
"Vineland will have a network of annual hopes, music will be there, but there will be a forest, so that we can attract a wide spectrum of wild animals," says Carlie Jones.
C3's partners, who received the price of Top Independent Promoter in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Heads of Terminals
It's not easy to apply Hollywood film studio to Montreal when it comes to setting itself a Terminator...
This convincing mission is one of the tasks of the delegation.
However, his mandate is "politically binding" because the California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger rejects "runaway productions".
Is it hard to drop the Governors into the tires?
"It's gotta be careful, it's an industry that decides where it comes from.
If he finds out that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our task is to offer those who will consider them the best," he said.
Festival Hungry
At this point, however, Denise Turcotte is the priority of promoting local film.
She's already starting a hunk for Oskary.
At all Western festivals, whether about festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about to present Quebec films, alert them and ensure that the directors give talks.
A few weeks ago, he had a good audience for the 30th anniversary of Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is in the hotel in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th anniversary of the Old Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short-term and four full-time films at the American Film Institute Festu.
Will the end of the year be on the bridge to the maraton?
Less than five weeks remain at the end of the year and investors are already expecting me to reach the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure they're coming to him.
Bank Banif is thought to be "from a statistical point of view, it's a month off the bridge for a positive course".
However, it is not appropriate to create predictions solely on the basis of statistics, in particular because, in the current context of the markets, certain doubts arise, at least short-term".
These experts do not assume that in the last few weeks the bridge will be decommissioned, and they state that "bursement market maintains existing liquidity that is prepared to invest in the absence of alternatives to guarantees, in particular a strong impact on the quality of securities, as in the long-term and short-term benefits".
Therefore, it is thought that the bridge will have a more comfortable course, never without volultality, "in particular because I do not know the impact of the likely loss of the FED (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of prices of roses and the risk of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the leading sales of BPI banks in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time for a bold declaration to come to Marathon.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," says this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4 % of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index ended at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analysis of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year for something close to 16,000 points thanks to the recapitalisation of portfolios and traditional incomes on pension insurance, which is coming every year at this time.
However, this expert points out that this year will be a little different, since it is expected that maraton will arrive early in the second half of the week after the extension of the Sabbath on the occasion of the Day of the Constitution.
The above analysis is unlikely to affect market orientation.
Federico Olucha, an analysis of Inversis Banco, also suggests that we are approaching a technical level and that "that is why we could look at the index produced by US reports on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
Analyticals believe these results will be positive.
Analyticals agree to choose titles that are intended to bring Ibex to the new maximum code.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "this year is a series of strong titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies, "because by the time this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
In contrast, Federico Olucha from Inverss Banco confirms that growth is going to go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sector.
The construction companies will also be able to enjoy this maraton if they come to it.
"ACS has been in position for several months now, and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
cyclical consumption will be in the last part of the year in advance due to an increase in sales during the evening sales period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology is also very good, even though it is not too popular on the Spanish market.
Five times during seven years
In the last seven years, the average was only in two months of decline.
The actual marathon came at the end of 2003, in the year 2003, when the bus markets ended the crisis by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 received 28.17%, the average increase was 6.68%.
We'll see if 2007 will be in the fifth profit year series (Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and will be able to have his maraton at the end of the year.
Two walls side of the Bank of Popular will have 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its neighborhoods.
A total of two seats located in the most expensive parts of Spain.
These sections carried out under the Popular Max mark are a major change to the bank.
Similarly, for the other Spanish entities, because it is the first group that decided to take such a step and set up an open time period of its vicinity up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, which also several times assured that he wanted to extend the opening time of his neighborhood, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the Opening Time Committees to replace 75 % of its areas on Saturday for the extension of the Opening Time by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience will be crucial to the involvement of other entities in this initiative, which supports the opening-up of the trading period, or not at all.
That's exactly the purpose of the project that popular bank did.
Find individual customers who are paying for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, businesses and businesses from selected streets, where they will come to open the neighborhood.
The bank wants to open 200 of these circuits throughout Spain for about 18 months, because it is not about opening new circuits, but only about adjusting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises the areas already in the commercial zones by adapting the customer profile in each street.
The extension of the opening time is complemented by another space of the area and with a new, more modern design in lighter colors.
The Managing Director of the Bank of Ángel River ensures that this restructuring will not mean much investment, but more staffing, as it passes from six employees to eight to nine.
The areas will even be equipped with rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid districts.
And it was a positive experience as Ángel River explains.
Selected areas in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía and according to Rivera seem to have been a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 rounds.
And the other 60 specialized immigrants who are executed under the Mundocredit mark also have a very long opening time and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax fields will not follow the BBVA model when the range of its neighborhoods offers a large scale of non-financial products.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They just agreed with the telephone to sell cell phones through external personnel.
Telecinco first on the bridge doubled the value of its Anteny 3 River
We made it.
Yesterday, Paul Vasile, executive president of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trading, when he found that the television he runs doubled the value of his Antony 3.
Just one thing said his joy: 'What I hate is that it didn't happen because we'd grow up more, but because we're less deaf,' he declared.
And he also pointed out that thanks to the weak market, we've been under pressure.
Telecinco concluded trade yesterday by 2,54 %.
This profit increased their losses by 15,66 % over the previous half of the year.
The annual value of this company, managed by Mediaset (with 52% capital) for the participation of Vocenta (other 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million according to Bloomberg's data.
Its competitor Antena 3, which last night weighed 1,52 % and had dropped by 40,5 % since last summer, has an average value of 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies, which were assessed, amounts to 3,571 billion in the case of Sogecapable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (supplier Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 offers 'cause we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market at what price and how we evaluate it in monitoring.
Telecinco announced last week that the year will be counted by the transition of billions of gross revenue from advertising to the first television channel, as confirmed by Giuseppe Tringali, Executive President of Telecinco and Publiespaña, which ensures the advertising of the group.
If the expected data were actually targeted, this television channel would record an increase of 3,6 % of advertising sales by 965.4 million in 2006.
Similarly, in the first nine months of life, the net activity of Antany 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors for which the analysis aims at the best relative development of Telecinco on the bridge is the increase in the payout that has so far been maintained: in 2006 this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarria, was split among its shareholders 100% of its profit.
Vasile assures that although the decision is early, this coefficient could be changed after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol’s company together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official obligation to grant at least 50%, although we have always voted much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to calm down our shareholders, which we have already raised the value of 33% of Endemol.
According to market analysis at these moments, it shows a certain award.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his returns to Telecinco, which was 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is the reason why they explain that the expected increase in revenue from 0.5% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1% in 2009.
The company also reduced the expected profit of Anthony 3, and it was 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

The Congress approved the transfer of MiFID from 1 November to
In conjunction with the parliamentary meetings, which were completed today by the vote of Congress on the new Senates included in the proposal for a law, the government has issued a public hearing of a regulation which is developing a new law with a view to both entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of individual parties have similarly extended the efforts of the Members and senators to clarify and agree with the best standard in order to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the market.
The MiFID Directive, which governs the Securities Trading Act, foresees the modernisation of the financial markets and at the same time strengthens the investor's protection, improves the rights of the State Commission on the Market with the Securities (CNMV) and supports cooperation between the European Union's individual supervisory authorities.
This new Regulation allows the provision of financial advisory services to be provided by specialized companies, both physical and legal persons and creates a new type of firm providing financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which are associated with securities companies, intermediate offices with securities and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of operating systems with financial instruments is widened by joining multi-border trading systems and internalisation systems that will compete with the current bunker markets.
The law continues to require companies providing investment services to disseminate on the market information on the key aspects of their commercial profile, risk exposure and risk-sharing methods, and requires a list of all operations carried out to simplify the review by CMMV.
During the trial at the Congress's Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among other things, to allow for classified searches to be considered as a "compressed" financial instrument in view of the high risk for investors that were exposed to the high risk of hypothetical debt (subprise) in the United States.
The transposition of the Directive was further used for the legal discharge of functions which could be held by the economic and business operators 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which covers the functions of economic experts.
At the same time, the Senate has organized the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require authorisation from CNMV and will be able to provide trade services with products and customers for various investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised ISC increased by five decades to 4.1 % in November.
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat for the calculation of the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices have developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat and the Central European Bank (ECB) policies to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but for using different methods of statistical modelling for the return of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistics Institute) noted that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore should not necessarily be compatible with the final data entered in the notice of 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain relatively high levels"
The second head of government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% is "the number of temporary", however, predicting that the price index will be in the coming months and will continue to be relatively "high level".
In any case, Solbes in the Congress halls stressed that "even if it is not a positive number", Spain's inflational difference against the trade union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that the November "was less surprising" than last month when the government didn't count on such a high rise.
"We expected the value of around 4 %," the Minister of Economy introduced the data submitted today.
Virginia is planning to build with Northern Rock 42 billion euros within three years
From the time the Bank of England received the Bank of Northern Rock in the crisis in half of the summer, its accounts fell by more than 50 % to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At the time, the bank had made a record of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually failed to trust customers for two and a half months, despite the fact that the government offered a percentage guarantee for the money and extended it to the end of the crisis.
Virgin, whose name replaces the entity's commercial financial sign Virgin Money, needs to gain around a quarter of the revenues entered into the UK banks in the following three years, so that she can earn those remaining 18 billion pounds and achieve the target of 30 billion.
The Group of Magnata Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom by its popular advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually for advertising and marketing to achieve its own initiative.
The Bank of Northern Rock signed a bid this week by the Virginia Consortium, which creates three other companies, such as the one that gives priority to saving her from bankruptcy.
Old Totany closed for certain corrupt practices on construction
The civilian guard today held the current age of the city of Totana (from Lithuania) for its alleged involvement in corrupt practices at the construction that was announced this week.
Next one of the secretary of the factory and the chief of the local police was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo reimbursed Juana Morales, a contemporary humane mission and until that time of the age of the village, which, according to the research sources of Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of the entire business.
The police continue to monitor the building of the building and the construction commission, and no further arrests will be made in the coming hours.
In addition, a lawyer named Juan Morales, a chief suspect of corrupt practices at the construction site, was charged with the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of the "humane" mission Juan Moralese, who was verified, stopped at the departure of the Morales House with important documents related to corruption.
According to the research sources, more than 200 hectares of land have been overqualified by the Morales' detailed selection for his signature of the construction agreement.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer of a state in front of these PSOE candidates and, if they win, the President of Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the president of the government and the general secretary of socialist José Luis Rodríguez Zapatera to become president of the Congress in the next general elections in front of the PSOE (Spanish Social Socialist Party) in Toledo and, if the socialists win the general elections, became president of the Congress.
So at the press conference, the PSOE secretary of the organization José Blanco and Bono himself announced this, after meeting with Zapater, who passed on this afternoon at the federal side of the page.
The executive head of an offer to the former minister explained that in political life "it is important to count with those best" and Bono "is among those best".
He further noted that "yes seems to be" that this policy from La Manchy would be a candidate for the Socialist Party to the Congress if the Socialists were to win the next elections.
Bono, as President of the Congress, rewarded Manuela Marín, who announced on 15 November that he would not apply in the next general elections and leave his active political career so that he could win the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister acknowledged that the president of the government continued to rely on him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He further pointed out that just as a citizen knows who will be the Deputy Minister of the Economy, if PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce the "transparent form" who will preside over the Congress.
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that Snow will change into "houses of respect and never burden or crisis" and he will realize that "it will be more like the citizens."
"When he complained that the only place in Madrid where he could not speak peacefully was Congress, the president of the government in Senat, on one occasion, has interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he sent a letter of praise to the current president of Manuela Marín and his "good work" and did not want to represent himself in his place, so that he would not be ashamed of the way he indicated what his opponents might consider to be "great."
Climate Promotion
In view of the fact that the struggle against climate change is disparaged by the cruel persecution of both those who observe the sceptics of its proposals and those who take the lead in other political and social wars, they must show strong solidarity.
And there is also the leader of a coup, who is the president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this war is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and is even willing to sign "a new treaty with the planet".
This proposal should explain why the activities or inaction of its government have contributed significantly to the fact that Spain is leading the European Union in the non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure in which the sectors where it happens and why its government, the government of the contract, have not prevented it.
In addition, this calls for the Spanish to explain to them what measures they are going to take to reverse climate change.
Those companies will suffer damage, which will have to change the customs of citizens, which are energy savings, individual and collective, which we will have to accept and which will have economic consequences.
In other words, who offers and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't expect such explanations, nor do we.
Just because it's necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are not popular.
Dear, unsatisfying and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the gas prices proposed by PSOE (Spain's Social Socialist Party), Zapatero felt so risky from looking at the wish that he had made it a mistake.
In other words, it is designed to save the planet so that it does not become, by pure propaganda, the words of any real meaning.
Possible phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And we make a covenant with the earth; and this is the Lord's doing, which neither speaks nor speaks; and He does not require anything, but He gives life to the dead, and raises up the dead.
If he's limited to being a virtual talking side and he doesn't want us to ride on the bike and agree with the believer.
Senior and local police chief Totany detained for suspicion of corrupt practices on construction
As the investigation sources reported, the Civil Guard arrested the old town of Totana, "man" José Martínez Andreo, head of the local police, secretary of the factory and one of the contractors in custody, for suspecting the escape of criminal acts at the construction site.
The old man was arrested in his apartment and transferred to a workshop in which he is now located with a number of police officers who have also brought to the Commission for the construction and urban business for the handling of industrial land and habitats.
These three arrests came to six of which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during the operation associated with over-qualification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground suitable for construction, so that after payment of illegal provisions during the past voluntary period, Nuaria could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but were charged in a short trial at the first instance of Totana.
Six of the first prisoners were handed over to the court today.
According to the information sources, an examination was carried out by the former mayor of Totany and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the Lido side (PP), Juan Morales.
His ex-wife, the owner of the real office, registered today in Totania and his contemporary friend, who lives in Murcia, was also charged with the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and a businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, who belongs to that group and is subject to payment.
The investigation is carried out by a group of criminal acts in the construction of the Central Civil Guard operating unit, whose members, in addition to the arrest, also carried out eleven visits, mostly in companies related to prisoners, with a seat in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontever, Las Rosas (Madrid province) and Totania.
At the time, only one person was arrested in Totania, and in the area it was a very well-known owner of the company's products from a remote mass that could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the establishment of the largest residential complex in the city of Totany, which would represent a building of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company received 2.2 million square meters of land overqualified and its project had to double the settlement of a city with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group creates companies such as Autesa and Inomonauur, which earn market support with properties, Conycase, which manages parking in Corunë, Venezuela and in the city of Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, who earns direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on promotion, sale and installation of construction units.
And that's what happens.
1st, 1st, 2st, 3rd, 3rd, 3rd, 3rd, 4th, 4th, 6th, 6th, 6th, 6th, 6th, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st, and 1st
If you're not against, we're leaving the Book of Month side, and we need another assessment and competition between us.

Our Finnish writer has sent us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish news in Helsinki Sanomat (by starting with the PISA report on education levels in the world), which calls for what the news published on 18 November, on that very day when the circumstances and criticisms of the Blackburn book appeared there:
"The content of philosophy led to public discussions in connection with tragedy at school in the city of Jokel.
The victim's voice, high school student, quoted in his accounts the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a school worker responsible for the subject of philosophy, asked on the pages of the journalist Helsinki Sanomat to impose a critical opinion on Plato and claimed that Nietzsche should not be included in the basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."
We've got three of them.
One colleague shall inform you of the introduction of a criminal offence from the Internet into a criminal law:
A. A pause of one song would be a criminal act with six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you drop in the sale of a paper at a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered to be only a contravention (§ 623.1).
B. If you decide to sell up to EUR 1 000, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than before the arrest (section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for arrest (§ 244.1).
D. It is less important to take part in barriers than changes in compacts.
Participation shall take place from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Penal Code) and shall be between six months and two years for the exchange of compacts.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered under § 184.2 of the Criminal Code less serious than the production of a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyrighted films is a penalty rather than a provision of pornographic material to young people (§ 186).
So if my colleague doesn't like it, someone's got a hand on it, and it's okay.

My healing doctor beats me one of his articles on a number of odd studies called "Moneys trigger brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or feelings that cause monthly payments to employees depend on how much colleagues do it.
The study was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonances on tomography and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernda Webera, the author of the study and leading group Life&Brain’s neurological vision in Germany: "The biggest activity occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague mistakenly."
The researchers observed that if both were successful, they received the same wage, the activation was peaceful, but when one got double, the activity was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much knowledge.
Balkans complaints
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been closely following from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in Haagu from the Balkan War.
Her mission will end by the end of the year and Carla will be leaving with mixed feelings because the main wines of Masakr in Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžic, are still free.
Their names are on the list, from which they took the name of the Swiss director Marcela Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, in Spain not mentioned), who, at the time of the Detective Triller's visit from Belgrade to New York, was a Swiss complainant in the pursuit of the late criminals and pressure on the States concerned to block the network.
What insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident. It represents a significant expenditure that depends on the various factors, such as age, status, sex, duration of driving operation, type of vehicle to be ensured or used as ad.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to explain what we're talking about.
Vehicle insurance is an agreement between the insurance and the insurance.
This commitment shall take the form of an insurance contract, which shall provide that the insurance is obtained by an appropriate amount of security at a certain level in order to cover the age of payment in the event of an accident.
The insurance price shall be determined in the light of different factors such as age, status, sex, length of holding the driving licence, type of vehicle to be ensured or used as ad.
Insurance companies estimate their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the likelihood of accidents, the higher the security rate.
For this reason, as individuals aged 25 years or so, women must pay less certainty, as statistics show that they have lower risk index in view of their care.
In the same way, on the basis of control, insurance companies have concluded that married persons have fewer dangers than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of driving and the likelihood of any accident.
The increase in driving frequency increases the likelihood.
There are many changes that insurance policy considers when it comes to the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver needs to study the situation carefully so that he can accept the insurance that is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important change to choose whether or not the type of insurance, which is not only the type of insurance but also the reasonable price.
The young people in their 50 years are meeting with various disabilities such as low management and short-term management experience when they want to sit at a safe price available.
Although ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are even easier options.
The most prudent drivers can choose insurance against all risks with low insurance in order to obtain the safe cover of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would presuppose a client's participation in the award of a certain event.
"A share of the reward of a certain event that will be provided by a client in advance when determining the price of the insurance which will be higher, the father would be less involved," explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, the Internet insurance intermediary.
Other options are insurance extended to other participants so that the client will be able to avoid damage caused by other persons, but not damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be secured against theft, fire and loss of vehicles.
Recommendations.
If you are younger than twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as soon as possible, because it affects your bonus and enables you to reduce your certainty in the future.
Bonus is a reduction in the basic rates of insurance company.
On the contrary, small is the increase in the basic rates mentioned.
"Bonus and the little will depend on sure and on her profit.
If she had a good year, she'd be able to allow herself to raise the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the border for twenty-five years, the drivers have a higher chance of meeting the insurance, because the customer's risk index reduces them because of the above experience.
For this reason, it is recommended that all risks insurance be met.
"Young people usually can't use the experience they have gained before they come to the emergency, and even when they're running," says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the regime when the "fear of the novelty" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married, but he still has no children, it is better to sit down to ensure that all risks are met, if that's what his economic situation allows.
Families with children are treated as insurance as a customer with the lowest risk index and therefore their symptoms will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be against all risks with a low insurance (which could be made 300 euros) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting in the third year of the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can allow themselves to get the highest discount here," says Luis Noguera.
The beneficiaries are recommended to ensure against all risks with low insurance (which amounts to EUR 150) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of accident but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a good reason for the proper study of insurance options, which would give us the most consideration in our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan, which means eightfinals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strengths this afternoon at San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they miss to achieve their respective goals in the conclusion of the "Campions" league, because for Italy it would be the first and in Scotland it would decide to take place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth reserve in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to ensure that Šachtóor does not have six points before him to play with Benfiko, who has four.
These two sets of group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, because AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Games in Japan, where the first three in the semifinals are in the effort to get to the end of the sixth.
So this group will be closed sooner than the rest and uncertain result at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both men are trying to win because Italians will not want to act on their home floor and Celtic knows that after the win, he would be the first and he would have a better place in the eighth grade.
The husband of Gordon Strachana could even become a play if the chess doesn't win, but can't slow down because at the same time, nine points are in the same number of Ukrainians who played in Glasgow (2:1) but won in the first round (2:0).
And so the actress AC Milan tries to hurt Scotts tonight, who believe that the area will get to the semifinals in reorganised Championships League just like they were injured in the same explosion in the previous competition in the height of Kaka in extension (1:0) by position 0:0 in the basic game of time.
Hope they win the "rossoneri" will be the chess for which the prize of victory is worth only if Celtic has won, and it's both for the eight-final process and for the UEFA entertainment.
Benfia, although it is the last and has no opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, it could reach a third place by one victory, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tournament took place in Vancouver
The Spice Girls group began in Vancouver, Canada, before 20,000 wilders of its first tour since its birth in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Hallwell) soon before their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver announced that their group's reunification was "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present, including videos that are similar to the stories of this group that have created a sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Returns and world tournaments are played at the same time when they receive new albums issued by the EMI in Spain, which brings the selection of their main successful recordings, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the bridge of a decorated flag that was given to their husband "Posh Spice", British footballist David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience that was sailing to GM Place, although the nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't even see our costumes, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show."
"Sporty Spice," whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused two years later the release of the five-member group, also introduced its nervousness when meeting with the journalists two hours before the start of the presentation.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public change changed, the view of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'd like to make a decision," Chisholm said about the reunification of the group that she left nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things came to an end and we're all very happy."
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls recently appeared together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virginia Airlines.
The plane was waiting for the army of horses at the airport.
Five of them have seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (4th) and Los Angeles (5th and 7th).
It's 23 December in Madrid.
Training from new fleets of bluefin tuna between Russia and Ukraine
Between Russia and Ukraine, there is a direct dispute on the prices of land oil and thus increases the risk of being affected by the Russian supply of this fuel into Western Europe.
The majority of the Russian oil exported to the European Union (EU) is known for its efforts across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow lifts prices from Ukraine, Russia will account for higher transit charges.
The conflict between these two previous years has reduced supply to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kyev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owns its own oil monopoly, Gazprom, is trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian oil in 2008.
Gazprom says Ukraine will have to account for more, as it agreed to pay up to 50% more than the oil it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from the Gaza Strip.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said Agent Reuters, Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoliy Kinach.
"The changes in oil prices should certainly be linked to our arguments relating to the above-mentioned transitional payments (to Western Europe) over Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kyev led to a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a wooden export route to Western Europe, which has increased prices.
The Russian flue represents one fourth of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest resources, but a large part of them remains insufficiently used.
As a result, Gazprom adds its own supplies with oil from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Mediterranean republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The Controller said that the Scottish Chambers of NHS must improve the control of criminal records in non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the highest control office of Robert Black came after the fact that a foreign doctor in Scotland was involved in a red attack on the Glasgow airport.
Mr. Black is also afraid that the Scottish NHS does not have a precise picture of the number of foreign staff employed.
But his report highlighted that the other key controls were conducted in an orderly manner by five health authorities.
The president of the highest control authority was immediately involved after the red attacks on the Slovak airport on personnel received from the country outside the European Economic Area.
Eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was held at the airport after someone hired Jeep to the main terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court with the help of a videomortem accused of being involved in a bomb attack in Great Britain.
NHS is expected to check foreign staff in terms of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in Great Britain prior to his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for the control of criminal records, this agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Authority says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to submit to the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which will help employees with controls in several countries.
"Since we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these controls, they are not carried out regularly," the report reported.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS agreed in many ways with its own cross-border policy, but he also added: "Our report alerts us to areas in which the system could be improved in order to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign personnel."
President of BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said that it is "very unlikely" that the transitional controls would identify potential NHS employees who could survive terrorist acts in the future.
"The report indicates that current transitional controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what other value these comments bring," he said.
Scottish health authorities reported that there are currently 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the highest control authority warned that these numbers would probably also be higher because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with residence permit.
The study also found that the control procedures carried out by NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian have been carried out to a large extent.
They included passport checks, labour permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently processing the policy and guidelines of cross-border controls for NHS workers.
The Ministry of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work without delay after a terrorist attack on the Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in accordance with the health commissions, will consider the recommendation of this report and ensure that the best procedures are made available in the updated transitional directives of all staff, including foreign staff, which plans to issue next month.
Joy Division ruled film prices
Control, a life-book film about the original song Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prices at the British Independent Film Awards, including prices for the best film.
Prices were also obtained from the star Sam Riley, who worked in the Curtise store, director Anton Corbin, and next to Toby Kebell.
Lady Judy Dench was named the best hero for the triller's scandal papers.
And the band star Daniel Craig got the Variety Award for getting a British film on the world scene.
Prices were awarded at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's trip to celebrate with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This red film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - has only 3 million free.
But he got Dutch photographer Corbino, previously known as U2 Joshua Tree, two prices for the best regime and for the best beginner.
The year's song was intended by another assessed - because Julien Temple film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer received the price for the best document.
The best priest's plaque was given by Vig Mortensen as the leader of the Russian Mafian boss in the London triller of David Cronenberg Eastern entrances.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard guys, has earned Richard Harris a prize for the extraordinary contribution of the British film.
This teenager, whose films include, for example, Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of the Christian League.
Winston said he was proud of this price, which was named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great hero of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffy, are made up of a party where filmmakers, priests and organizers attend the festival.
Between the station and the boss Bif is Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nigh, Sea Syolová and Michael Winterbott.
Saudi Arabia closed 208 people due to terrorist harassment
Last night, Saudi Arabia announced that 208 soldiers were arrested because of the members of the gangs preparing for an uninterrupted attack on the same device and also on the spiritual and security components.
The state television of the largest Russian exporter reported that one of the rebels wanted to land rockets.
Sympathetic al-Qaidi led the campaign against monarchy, United States allies, from 2003, and from invasion to Iraq.
The television reporter reported that eight of the militia leaders planned an attack on a rogue device in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is quick to react to the 35,000 members' forces on the defense of the Al-Qaid's undisputed attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrested persons belonged to the so-called "expert on rocket detonation", which had broken down into the country.
She further indicated that the soldiers were planning to invade the kingdom of eight shots.
22 prisoners had to prepare for the murder of spiritual and security workers.
The government recommended that they make more efforts to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join the Al-Qaedian militia fighting the associated forces and the Chinese government, which the conservative Saudi sunwits consider to be a kaciris.
The Al-Qaedish militias are thought to have bought many spiritual bodies in South Arabia to support the royal family that governs the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of the leader al-Káidi Saúda We use bin Ládin to focus on the Western Saudi government - have focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy equipment.
"This war was a huge effort of security forces in the past... five months," state television said the Ministry's interior speech.
The 16th "medial bunk" in Medina was also arrested, which was intended to promote "takfirical thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the prisoners, 32 were also accused of providing financial support to the military.
The climate in Venice is possible by looking to the future of the Earth
The scientists announced yesterday that Venus could sometimes be a pleasant place for life.
Data from the surrounding European station show that the planet is even more similar to the beautiful two Earths than it once thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are just as big and run after the same dear ones, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago in Venice, conditions were similar to those on Earth and could also be common.
But the combined gravitational effect caused by oxytemolytic, atmospheric erosions of solar radiation and the lower rate of rotation sent Venus after a completely different path of development.
Today is a planet without water, the temperature on the surface is pretty hot on the ceiling of the waves and lets it fight and wind about the strength of the hurricane.
Research from the European Space Agency Venus Express, who studied the planet for one year, offers a balanced view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of Oxford University physics and one of the leading mission Venus Express said: "The more clearly why the climate in Venice is so different from the Earth, the more the planet itself is different.
"Our new data enables us to set up a scenario in which Venus began the same way as Earth, perhaps with the civilian environment, billions of years ago."
The police kept an "exceeded uranium"
About the radioactive material, allegedly contaminated uranium, was detained by the Slovenian and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police spoke out that three people were detained and the material was tested.
He didn't claim to be a favorite uranium, but he said it could be sold for $1 million (480,000 free).
Still Done
Mit Romney said it is not appropriate for presidential candidates to answer snow questions.
Meanwhile, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed with the YouTube debate in which the ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and forwarded them to the disbanded candidates.
None of the questions raised in mid-November 28 were as comical as a snowflake who asked Democrats about global warming in the debate on YouTube on the other side.
But the questions and answers have now reflected a lot on the status of the Republican Party, which is headed for elections in the coming year.
It is not clear exactly how the CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose the clips that were then indicated to the inspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the most recent time devoted to the one subject, was focused on the accession.
This theme is one of the strongest things in the Republican.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to surround the audience when they heard something comforting: the voter recorded the high levels of agreement when the candidates spoke about a hard access to borders.
The firmest and most recent exchange of views came between Rudy Giulian, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who was released before key voices in Iowj and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giulian is trying to get a hundred stories of a man who has been a New York's prime minister as an illegal visitor.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former government of Massachusetts of hireing illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two were particularly careful when the prosecutors asked whether any of the candidates would support "admissibility" (to give illegal immigrants the normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
Other candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, have been able to come up with a little bit of money on this subject.
None of these two have the chance to nominate, but they both remain in the game, perhaps because they started to be on the streets because of immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on arrival candidates have the same opinion: greater presence at borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, coupled with the concerns of contemporary games from China and other elderly people around the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the gap between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giulian was asked why he in the past supported the possession of firearms.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulation heating technique should be considered torture.
One pastor asked if the candidates believed every word from the Bible.
This led to the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, it is likely that he does not believe the story of Jonah and the faith.
Another priest asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions at the first place in a recent study in Iowj thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is unacceptable but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, Jesus said that Jesus was too smart to apply for what he was doing with his lips.
The room is not usually open.
Mr. Huckabe's presence in Iové is covered by recent success in getting money and the happy voice of Ron Paul in the middle of the debate.
These two have declined since the day, because both sides are still unable to agree on more prominent and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very quickly and convincingly with a victory message about the American size on the rts, placing both sides on both sides.
This time the page is split and the result is far away from meaning.
Laborers ’ Diseases
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is common in the British political scandals, this is not particularly pictantic.
There seems to be no order being sold, no bills in the Paris hotel have been paid in good time, no manipulative fingerprints have been paid.
But the hidden Gordon Brown would have made it clear that some wealthy businessman, after four years, had masked contributions to the ruling Labour Party in excess of $650,000 (1.3 million) in the name of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister turned his attention to the appeal and accused the British intelligence of not having been affected by this decision, there was hope that he would ensure a peaceful and effective government.
Instead of expressing the more impressive president of the Liberal Democrats, Mr Brown sometimes changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unguarded saved problem bank Northern Rock showed a weakness in the management and coffee trial under the deck.
The wrong thoughts about changing the tax code were linked to the company's collective opposition to the government.
The loss of personal data by 25 million people has left unrepresentable administrative burdens.
The three generals of the Treaty launched opposition in the shadow of the Lords; they protested against the massacres in military spending, for they claimed that being the leader of the armed forces was a part-time occupation.
Now there are hundreds of gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of the lab (and their former internal discipline monitor), has rejected them.
It doesn't mean that Mr. Brown would never go back to his end.
In addition, governments can achieve a point of overcrowding followed by difficult governance.
People don't believe politicians and they don't like them, but most of them take their distrust away when we take it to a new party.
Once it seems clear that some prime minister is probably not better, and should not be in the office for a long time, this is a move away from: the government becomes a hero, the ministers start doing briefing, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming uninterrupted and defensive.
On the one hand, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, because he cannot turn the position of another political leaders into a new cost.
As far as he'd like to get away from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial authority records are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in the blairovsk minority, for example, a long-term study of the funding of political parties caused by “money” can be found to be comforting.
Still, Mr. Brown's anger isn't as bad as they seem.
Those concepts are not as sharp as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was raised to be buried.
And the treatment, no matter how painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a balanced, firm and easy government.
The latest solutions around the political gifts are a good example.
Mr. Garboids, who compares his gifts with charity, says that he did not wish for his kindness to any advertising.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's procedure, but didn't know that he was illegal, will certainly be listened to properly; likewise, Jon Mendlesohn, the chief labyrinth collector who learned about eight gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not yet involved; there is nothing that would indicate that he knew about these wars, even though the main part of the payment went on until after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has already done half of the work.
He was very quick to condemn this violation of the laws by his own party, but he resolved his decision by saying that he had done so by means of a certified instrument, the commissions to investigate this matter - they were also led by the bishop in the debt and the judge.
In this case, teaching is not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of police concern.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent Chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards and Public Life, which has no more than six months to do with the real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require the workers who are in difficulty to cooperate with the conservatives and may even have given up their special financial relationship with the committees - a hot pill for the hand-held party Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a listening ear; he has two years to get back the volleyball; and the only way to express the victory is to have an inadvertent integrity and high competence.
Cartoons
Does the crisis affect the underlying mortgage of the American credit card market?
When it's in the water, naturally, it's about to start moving the redfish.
Now that the American market with properties is cold, the contractors are focused on the darkest credit card market.
Goldman Sachs' analysts say that losses on credit cards would be made if other consumer credit options from the underlying mortgages were sought, could amount to $99 billion.
The pressure signals are clear.
There is an increase in the number of cases of failure to pay (up to 30-day delay) and outstanding accounts (accounts considered by the supplier to be incapacitable).
HSBC reported last month that in the US consumer credit market, $1.4 billion was lost - also due to non-solvent loans on credit cards.
But the panic is still fast.
The disbursed accounts and the inability to pay are still small.
According to Moody's assessment agency, 3,89% of the payment incompatibility rate in the third quarter was almost the total percentage point under average.
Absorbing measures may be partially explained for technical reasons.
The change in the US personal banking laws of 2005 led to a sudden decrease in the number of reported banknotes that make a large part of the loss of credit cards; the number of calls (and the number of letters) would therefore fall regardless of whether the current conditions for investors were compromised.
The company also shows a good balance of wages, which shows how many consumers per month pay their debts.
And the trust in the valuable paper of secured credit cards is strong, and through the parallelism in other boxes of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney of the Watch Group's research company predicts that their emissions in 2007 will be 25 % higher than the input.
The direct route to spread infection between the crisis of underlying mortgages and the market of credit cards is crucial: when loans are paid to the real estate, consumers are more likely to be owed through credit cards.
Credit card providers are increasingly looking at the cash flow rather than the value of handing over items, so the falling prices of the home do not necessarily mean a change in the reliability of creditors.
They can even be useful to the lenders.
The motivation of consumers to pay mortgages is high when the value of their property is lower than the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards is raised on the list of priorities for payment.
The payee will also be able to respond faster and more flexiblely to the hottest conditions than the supplier’s mortgage by changing the interest rate or thresholds.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the price of handmade items.
"It doesn't happen that we would just overestimate all the loans in one beautiful morning," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of subtype hypotheses is low, the risk of progressive deterioration is far more real.
If the lower prices of home and debt reduction force America into recession, the credit card sector will be facing the darker future.
Look at those red-flights.
British bankers admitted the blame in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were to be associated with their role in the dispute associated with former financial leader, Enron Andrew Fastowe, changed the charges in the middle and admitted wine.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of the seven charges of fraud when they had to share with Fastow in 2000 in the financial investigation -- they had to fight for the account of their employees -- they had to.
They had to stand before the court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Court Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each admitted to the same case.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a company of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was described on previous pages throughout the two years that continued to hold the executive management.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation initiated by Enron in 2001.
The charges against him in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that the purpose of the government investigation was to investigate the land of Enron.
The complaint against the bankers -- who served as the "NatWest Three" review -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to establish a dispute with Fastowe and his former prime minister Michael Kopper.
The Greenwich NatWest company invested in Enron's partner area controlled by Fastowe, which was the architect of the numerous Enron's subcontractors that pursued Enron after the spying of the banknote.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this area zero, but our three Britons knew that it actually had a significant value.
The Kopper control company bought the bank share in this grant of $1 million.
Incriminating banks paid Cooper for a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to Fastow's complaint, Enron falsely reported that the energy company pays for its share in this area of Greenwich NatWest.
All those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastows and others.
Bankers obtained 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others recovered $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted the wine in two cases for his role in the eradication of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving six-year sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for three years and one month in a facility in Tehran.
All three Britons moved to the prison for the release of $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the trial to come.
Enron, once the seven largest companies in the country, sat in the banknote in December 2001, after which it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or to show a growing speculation as profits.
The collapse has destroyed thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Founder Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief executive officer Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their role in the company's disaster.
Skilling is performing more than four-year-old punishment.
The charges against Layem were dropped after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow’s Non-Strengthening
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel for the nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, it's still small on return.
"May be up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them is interested in such a place, because it's for the sake of the family or the company president."
Mr. Firer sat in the floor of the Gulfstream last Friday at the Millionaire exhibition, which is a four-day consumer organ in a small exhibition center in the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers, who hoped that freshly rich Russians would find on all of the mahogany-laid yachts after diamonds that would have gotten over to a car that wouldn't have been 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looked carefully after the orange Porsche in the next room.
"It's a nice car, but it's five and ten against us," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest market in private aircraft."
On the streets of the Russian capital, the money will be collected just as if it had Dallas' days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans were very rich and divided into Europe, where they looked like materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year-old listener at the centre of Russian and Euro-Asian Studies in Harvard.
Just like the Saudis of the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s, Russia is becoming the most prominent of the world’s wastes.
The most exclusive luxury characters are looking for this clone of their work.
In another place in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatallu Versace, Toma Forda and Bernarda Arnaulta, led by the LVMH Group to exchange views on how to sell expensive goods on markets, such as the Russian.
(The Conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which owns The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people in Forbes magazine with a total of $332 billion.
The Local Institute in the Center for Economic and Financial Research has also issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "drug" millionaires in Russia whose assets amount to $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 the Russians lived 15.8 % under the limits of the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of the London colony of David Morris.
She was on the front porch, together with the Russian distributor of this sign, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are completely adjusted, and men are everyone for all names."
When they spent the evenings in the evenings on Sunday evenings, Evgenia Yumatov's eleven-year-old Svetlan Turovkov and his clients marked themselves and their clients for millions.
"I was looking at this car and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who was wearing a brand-new dress as a veteran of red blankets, after which Joan Rivers appears to be a housewife.
Veletrh seemed to be mainly focused on clean, well-managed Russian buyers who are willing to spend a few hours in road transport so that they can walk through the warehouse that surrounds Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishing, Mvöenpick winters, holiday tables, apartments in Dubai, Gund and the town hall.
Members of the simple public could buy revenue of EUR 30 ($44,57).
"The Russians are interested in what the sign is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically bought the statue of the Dutch producer of the Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's picture from hand-made blue shirts in a magnificent size.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in luck."
And the fact that later sellers say that the Russians with the old money (according to Russian estimates are 10 to 15 years old) have moved from the blogs to a few well-known signs of limited editions that would never appear on the shopping cart.
Even a few thousand people, whether they are millions of people, millions of people, or just tourists, the day when the storm of the storm came.
And some of them bought it.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the local general manager of King Koil's plant, introduced that he sold two macaroni seeds of ivory, casmium, and cotton, which were decorated with gold nitres, after $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, who manufactures a high-end car with high-end alarms, said his company sold a clear orange Porsche for $170,000 for Russian million.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who at his request manages a luxury car, announced that he sold three networks into a car in the style of the dedicated rollings-Royce Phantoms.
He showed the reporters around the car designed for the Russian casino owner, who had to blow up the elevated Swarov crystal so it looked like a roller.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"This Russian millionaire who wants a dog car or a portrait of his wife from the circle circle, must not drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karpetian.
"He puts them in his garage from thirty to four cars."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" in the meantime does not mean anything very exclusive, given the large increase in prices of older properties.
"If you bought yourself three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably already millions, at least on paper when you're not ready," he said.
"They're more than you think."
Those who are not millions could at least advance wealth at the stage of the Russian-led Alliance Continental, which is in favour of active management.
The company drew up four red phone booths of British style stolen from fake banknotes in the value of millions of dollars.
Asad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, pointed out that his team had issued 500 000 fake banknotes for the Great Millionaires.
In the meantime, they stopped to spread money around the collection, either to leave friends to take a mobile phone, to rest in the middle of the reward wealth, or just to collect a few million copies of it.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by an operation
It was the day before the wedding when Roland Livingston looked out of the big eyes of the restaurant about something healthy and followed by a hall that came to a white New England house with two houses more than after West Scott Avenue.
The car was soon joined by police observers.
And then another one.
"Then I saw how the court doctor's delivery came," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"At the moment, I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman Olga Arroya, 41 years old, was an executive assistant to the head of the Norwegian police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to an unlicensed plastic surgeon who refused to provide the identity of the police who worked at the house number 212 at West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they hope that toxicological tests, whose results should not be yet known, will help to solve the painful death that the German police have sent out with a lot of grief.
Ms. Arroy has been the assistant officer of the police department, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, active and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a telephone interview in the middle.
"It was my protection.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an former non-warn police officer who worked for the Commission on the Control of Alcoholic Drinks, and that he was leaving two sons at 14 and 11 years of age and his own daughter.
Eilen Walsh, a spokesman for the Union's national representative, Theodore J. Romankov, said that the detective is trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities indicated that the noise had reached home in three hours on Sunday 21.
November and found Ms. Arroy on the floor.
She was reported dead on site.
More than a week later, the authorities continued to say a little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is reportedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't tell me if Miss Castro's offices were listening.
The investigators shall try to determine whether the part of the house is used as an organisation.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, no one answered, with a broken rose in the mirror and a farthest behind.
According to the door that led to the lock, he wore a blue barl in an open garage with the letter "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is a substance used as a substitute for food and cosmetics.
On one side, there were two mountain cars on the other side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York's New York Police Department 25 years later, Ms. Arroyo provided him with invaluable assistance in the investigation of his new city's hate - and harsh political culture.
"She said, "You should be careful about this or this," he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was a trap."
Hopes Fed reduces interest rates, leads to the strengthening of the world's bridges
The share prices on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday dropped after the market's hope that the Federal Bank would try to ease the loan conditions by further lowering the rates were strengthened by the satisfactory results of the U.S. Central Bank's vice presidents.
In London, New York, and in front of Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line with Ben Bernank, President of the Federation, said that in response to the continuing pressure on financial markets, the drivers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In an apparent effort to calm the underlying market between the signs of credible fraud, Mr. Kohn said that recent developments "particularly brought some improvements in the functioning of the markets to the end of September and October".
He further pointed out that if the increased instability persists, it would increase the possibility that the financial conditions of the household and the company would continue to deteriorate.
Investors consider these products to be a signal that Fed is ready to add to the US market another net capital dose, and perhaps further lowering level rates in order to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped to calm Wall Street among other bad reports about the American economy when the sale of housing in October showed a record of low numbers.
The results of the financial credit were supported by the investment bank Bear Stearns's announcement that it would reduce 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, in order to reduce costs due to the compensation of the heavy losses caused by the failure to provide subsidised housing loans in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be destroyed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial index Dow Jones grew by 331 points, or by 2.55 per cent, and closed at 13,289.40, while the more used index S&P 500 increased by 2.65 per cent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, and ended at 6,306.2, while the value of British blue chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 per cent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
Before some time, credit pressure on the markets was shown in full force after the European Central Bank’s three-month loan to the European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is more than in April 2001.
The pressure on the English bank to monitor Fed and the ECB and put the London cash market on the standard money, increased by the rise in the rates of the three-month British interbank loans "Libor" after an undisclosed increase from 12 November to the maximum since the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopar?
We have two dilemmas here, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's going to be number six in England this weekend in Candy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopar?
And, in the broader context of anything less relevant than the first test against Sri Lanka, who has made this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the committee's election, which will be held at the later stage, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the help of the decision, and because Hugh Morris, the chief executive of the English team, is beginning to fill out applications for the post of the national electorate, so that they do not need to be fully taken into account.
The one who won't stand on the sixth floor will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find out what one will get at the top of his profession, while someone else will never get over a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket that the choice is formal and requires a trial which must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopar to move up?
It's a party to Shaw, right?
At the same time, we could ask ourselves, in another area, to say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and supervision in the area, should be raised to the Commission - instead of just one.
Who should say what level is right for the cricket if he doesn't have a chance to climb or swim on the other side?
In particular, they have a large impact on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must catch the captain's view at the right time if he has to take the wicket, and the pilot needs a regular chance at starting positions, if he ever has to make a home as a single cricket.
Losing the sight of the desert is more complicated.
For example, in the London season there was a lot better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems to be certain, even though Stephen Harmison had declared himself a healthy worker.
Anderson took 32 weeks in the first class at 33 every.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same dark average, but they both had their own moments at the highest level and hoped in another.
If he's playing at the Asgiria Shah stadium, or Bopara can be the only thing to see.
Volba can grow or reach both careers, or it must not have a great impact either.
Four years ago, Garyth Batty played in each test and in the first class gave good results, five weekends and 40 permits, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, which is more than, although in Australia he recorded two hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in the presence of today's coach, will follow their conservative instincts and give Sha's greater experience before the youth rebellion of Bopar.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks of his sharp and valuable debutive test changes in the 88 points in Bombaji and 32 percent in the first class of the six Bopars, who are, in the 20s, seven years of age and has excellent statistics against spin spins.
However, Shah made two changes in April against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his home church in Middlesexu, only ten times, and that, together with the immediate rejection of the electorate, when Vaughan wanted to reassess him on another game, it seems that his withdrawal was picked up from an elan that was so evident in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Esex University has the joy of living in the bones.
On the cricket floor, he does not pull it up, and his conduct outside the garden symbolizes a recently converted car with a foot on four cars on the exhibition day of the British team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He was brought up with slight injuries and suddenly shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vadaphone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his partner, who was going to watch him ask him out loud, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-fast smiles on the higher hills that seem to respond to him, effectively releases and fires himself and manually.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's just a real art of choice.
I personally cling to Bopar to get his chance now that I don't want to say that Shah won't be great if, as the celebratory tea leaves indicate, he'll be the one who's gonna play this next weekend.
Autobusy will bring back the back to work - and to fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi hostages from Syria started to come to Baghdad yesterday and excavate students who came to pay or spent time on the river, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed men who escaped from their homes.
The Mansürs bus station was already before 800 people from Damascus arrived in the official bus stop of buses, full of passengers from Syria and Jordan who returned from private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, Sunni doctor.
"I'm back today because of what I've seen on television and what I've read in the news, about what was done in Baghdad and how it's safe now.
"They say that Mahdí's army has stopped killing people," he said, in the opinion of the Chilean military militia of Muktady al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to cease the war.
Kásim al-Atwana, an eight-year-old Chinese teacher from the vast Sunni region of Amaria, returned with his two children, because he could no longer restore the Syrian visa and because the darker regime did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His neighbors called him with the help of the American army to pull Al-Qaeda out of her position on the west side of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who escaped from his home in Sleku in northern Baghdad after he attacked his fellow citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"In the past, several friends called me and told me that they were breaking up in Slika's army against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my mountains.
That's why I came back today," said 20-year-old Sabaah Ala Obeid.
Many talked about the attractiveness of the comfort in the capital after the strengthening of the American military presence and the growth of the local "computers of the citizens involved", which are armed with arms on the side of the American army to defend their fourth.
But it was more about the restoration of the barrier around the river and the loss of money in Damascus, where in recent years more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been killed.
Salaam al-Samaraj, a 11-year-old father of three children, voiced the suspicion that Núri al-Maliki, the Czech Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas and accepted them back.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people were killed before Iraqi sectoral murders.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed on the government to stop giving the Iraqis visa to return to Iraq," said the Sunni ambassador.
"I can't believe the government that supports the criminals who slept after my departure from the house."
Partly the reason for the reduction of violence is the fact that the sunni were drawn out of the Chilean areas and on the contrary, which reduces tension in many places.
There are fears that a sudden wave of overcrowds will again cause sectoral tension and lead to another conflict.
Little Saarsko, good education
Germany's least common country plays a leading role in vocational education, and is even superior to the international focus of its high schools.
Only in one educational area, Syria is concerned with the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"The man who doesn't leave Sárska, I explained yesterday after the fifteenth anniversary that we are no French" - this seberonic word appears in Sársk on the payments for the 50th birthday of this least nation country.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the educational system of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
Schools are so traditionally co-operated with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 in France.
So far, students can finish the study by two or even three degrees.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students who make 15.6 %.
However, the excessive number of children in Syria is to be admitted to high school - many of them even without a university degree.
"A professional education system is used in Syria," says Axel Plynnecke, a educator expert IW.
The fact that more than every five-year-old is entitled to study in a professional school is more than 7% over the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Syria to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunity to study two camps is given the number of the second best citizens throughout Germany.
In the past years, the number of graduates of the third-party engineering has been practically oriented and demanding.
Therefore, the Serbian Ministry of Education has now ordered high schools to create a propaganda campaign on engineering.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have performed several refurbishment at the general schools," says the school's speech ministry.
As a result, the government carried out comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning first, the last year of maternity schools is free - model that is also being passed on by other foreign countries.
If the results of the complaints are clearly improved, they will show that future comparative studies are being conducted.
In the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, the risk share decreased from 29 to 20%.
However, Sarska has not improved as much as any other foreign country.
Buffalos can count better.
And to weaken the Saarska study of the Scriptures, it does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - in a negative case, it could be true in this area.
The language of the neighbors is also binding on the Ginasian people - even though the citizens of Sárska are not French.
Timed out
What they don't see is going to be in Venezuela, other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to spend hours in this South American country for half an hour back.
In Spain, there is a funny figure between the Chavez.
The Venezuelan official stated that according to the new law, hours will be reduced by less than four and a half hours.
The South American state will take this step in the time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the United States, has given reasons for his decision, apart from the fact that the United States has been involved in the distribution of the world’s timetracks over the entire hour.
In the middle of the local time, Chávez also announced that due to the reason for the handcuffs, the relationship with the neighboring Colombia was interrupted.
This left-wing nationalist announced that while the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia would not be able to maintain any relations with him or his Colombian government.
"I can no longer vote for my own sake," said Chavez, who is promulgating the reform of the Constitution, to which this poor country must vote in the referendum.
The reform of this reform would strengthen its power in the country.
The Häkk made Uribe's decision to deny the Chávez' trust to join the Marxist rebellion in Colombia.
Uribe, by his decision Venezuela "flyed face," criticised on Sunday of Uribe Chavez.
And in Spain, everyone's talking about Cávez.
The new mobile call here created a solution: "Why not this call" (Why are you no longer silent?) - so the news that has already reached over half a million people on the Internet.
She was told by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit of the top of the vote, was so shocked by the fact that he was silenced.
Germans are at risk of lower costs in 2007
According to the forecast, this year it is a threat to German employees to reduce real brains even through strong conjunctures.
Experts have given their pessimistic prognosis a whole range of reasons.
According to Nadace Hanse Böckler, people can actually count in 2007 by getting lower breasts than in the last year.
"Vinu is not a small increase in wages, tax increases from added value and price increases in food and energy," said Debilt Gustav Horn of the IMC Research Institute (Institut für Macroekonomi und Konjunkturforschung).
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
The Minister of Finance of Peer Steinbrück told the news Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of contributions to unemployment insurance for the new year is fair and reasonable in this situation.
However, the work agency should no longer fall into such hatreds to require loans or contributions from the youth in society, citing the news of this social democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and raw products avoided inflation on its highest level over the last thirty years.
In the annual price comparison, the total price was three per cent.
Venice is a beautiful two-year-old country
The Venus Land is more similar to what has been predicted in its lifetime. The European space probe Venus Express in Venice has recorded the waves that appear in winter on Earth: lightnings in the atmosphere and windy belief in the fields.
Almost three decades ago scientists thought it was in Venice.
The European probe Venus Express has now provided evidence - it has acquired electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venice, lightnings fly from the dark to the dark at about 56 kilometers high, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russell of the California University of Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory of the origin of the original mass, it was possible to cause life on Earth by the whites. The bourgeois had a significant effect on the ocean’s reactions that led to the occurrence of amino acidselin, the basic stones of life.
There was no such thing in Venice: "If there had ever been a life there, it must have been a long time," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today there would be some living salt found on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times worse than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"It's probably a two-way country, but it's a two-way road," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so small and size-like Earth, started to develop completely different, is the basic question of the mission of Esa.
In view of the fact that no probe has been sent exclusively for the study of Venus since the beginning of the 1990s, the start of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was in research with this planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of research, which approached several articles in Nature magazine, did not highlight only the unity of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighbouring planet is similar to the Earth before it was predicted," Esa said.
In addition to the famous windmills in the north, scientists have found dark faith in the south pole, which is much faster.
This phenomenon recalls air raids on the northern part of the country, writes a research team under the direction of Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of the Institute of Astrophysica Spasiale and Fisica Cosmica.
The second most internal planet of our solar system creates almost the same amount as Earth, and with an average of 12 100 km is almost the same size.
This planet is marked as the Yitränka or the Night of the Sun for a minimum of 225 days.
However, along its own axis, it is much smaller. One day in Venice, it lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus’s surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars Earth are not mentioned, scientists conclude that both planets have experienced very similar conditions.
The water was collected on both sides, but on the ground remained in the oceans, while the Vanushe disappeared into the universe.
While the liquid oxide on Earth is bound to the Earth in carbon dioxide, most of the atmosphere is formed in Venice.
Kühler defends Merkel's meetings with Dalailam
The School President Köhler calls for the end of the party disputes due to the adoption of the contract in the office.
The SPD immediately criticised her attacks on the cancer after a mutual meeting in September.
School president Horst Köhler is taking care of Germany's history and calling for a great coalition to end our argument along the way.
"We should not, of course, present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler said to the business newsman Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision taken by the German Chancellor Angely Merkel (CDU) to take the Dalailam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal pay," Köhler said.
The school president pointed out that everyone knows that Germany needs to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but this did not prevent him from becoming a Merche when it was calculated that it would create a new policy for China.
"The collective office did not leave the traditional policy of China alone.
China also knows it," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) gave his immediate absence with the adoption of the data, and for this he was attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier went on a "predictive" foreign policy of coalition.
After the adoption, we are in the office of the Office of the Secretary of State, and the German-Chinese relations have deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Minister of Finance Peera Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the SPIEGEL newspaper, it also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of foreign ministers.
The Chinese president of the government, Wen Jiabao, called the Chancellor Angel Merkel to admit that the adoption was a mistake.
China disagrees when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao highlighted China's position.
The words and deeds of our colleagues showed that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas, also located in the territory of China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that broke out in France
Street battle with the police, shootings, the car burned. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social insecurity in Germany does not stop in violence on the street, called by the Minister of Social Affairs inside.
Bariqueds of the fires, excavators shot the blocs on the police. After serious disturbing young people in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior of Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of similar developments in Germany.
"We need to be careful that we also do not create such social tension that will lead to violence.
We must take it seriously," said the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person can be compared with the rapid change in social reality.
Social government, countries and citizens are already working hard to solve problems, Schäuble said.
That's not just the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration after the Islamic Conference, we record the first success."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German subjects are not comparable to those of the French.
In the past few nights, youth with the police in the northern provinces of Paris was engaged in a tough street fight.
And in Toulouse she burned a car and a public building.
The German government requested greater integration efforts by the Turkish mayor in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the tension in France, Kolat warned against "a similar effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Still, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 years of age who belong to the family of migrants, unemployment is "very high".
In particular, there is a need to ensure more study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We have to give young people hope."
The President of the Turkish People, however, added that in Germany, there is more social control of the family than in France.
In addition, many young immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we have to pay attention."
We've got to make it easy for young people to start working and learn.
In the middle of the night, the Parisian town of Williers-le-Bel was extremely quiet.
There were hundreds of police in the area, and over the area, there was a flashlight.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and several fire-fighting and car fires.
Since yesterday, there are about 1,000 organized forces.
The police will record as long as it is necessary, notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Michelle Alliot-Marie after his visit.
In the rooms at Villaers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured in the night.
The next night, Toulouse's room was caught.
She was constantly in the middle of a traffic accident in which two young people came to life.
According to the original finding of state representation, the police are not guilty of the death of young people.
In the "Obliques" line.
The fact that the distanced output actually proves that coalica is programmed at the end and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
In which country does this office actually live?
After her sad, grappling and poor appearance at the general debate on the Social Dream, we have to find out: not here - not in this country that she should end up in.
As a result of being too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel responded to a very arrogant spirit.
It's a province, she said, which she showed she doesn't want to understand what critics are talking about.
In the Society's dream, she clearly showed everyone how much she deserves this reading.
Mark’s experience was not of real interest, nor was it of real interest to him, nor was it of concern to the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela's "Oblak's" was presented: a political one that turns out to be against others who are going to foreign politics, and it's just a soft one.
For example, climate protection: without stopping, they are grateful for the conclusions from the Summit in Heiligendam, but they are no longer saying how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And, of course, such a car - so unsatisfied that the CDU president would leave two years ago.
Now it's limited to the plan of phrases that could increase the bond between people.
This approach damages its pragmatic image, which does not need to be left out because problems are solved.
But in England's "Oblac" solution, there are internal political problems in the region.
Children's poverty and the elderly with low income?
A few more stories on this subject have been left to her.
In fact, it's like Merkel's often saying it's about child contributions.
Merkel has to start three times from the beginning in order to be able to express at least partially the right wind.
Once things start to be very specific, it's stuck like in a very strange field.
Division of the Court of Justice
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates at Youtube, in the case of the favour of Rudy Giulian and Mitta Romney, was discussed in the press - and now both must fear the outside candidate.
The appeal of both candidates is already under way on the first subject.
Mt. Romney argues with his opponent Rudy Guilian that he made "purchasing for an illegal visitor" in New York.
Giulian is quick to react to sharp reports: "I think his own house was just one such attack," replys and convinces former governor Massachusetts that he was personally employed as an immigrant without evidence.
In view of the lack of clear preference for the republican fundamentals, eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute Internet users and via YouTube send videos serve only as a hints of the key theme.
"We have made Hitler's isolation policy so powerful," John McCain puts forward to his rival Ron Paulo, who is the only one who enjoys the immediate withdrawal of the army from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain is not shielded by his findings or by Romney, for refusing to judge the torture method of hearing called "Waterboarding", where the heat is simulated.
The public's reactions in the Florida St. Petersburg show that among the important topics of the campaign, there is no war in Iraq or methods of torture.
The promise comes into effect whenever conservation values are respected and future tax increases are avoided.
So it shows where the weakness of both favorites lies.
"I have been wrong this time," explains Romney's blog, asking for a page-based and television-based release because he was still in power in 1994.
Giuliani is in trouble when he has to express himself to the Bible’s logical explanation.
Musharaf First Government in Civil
The day after his resignation from the position of the top military commander, the Pakistani government of Musharaf made a presidential oath.
That's the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
President Parvíz Mustaraf made a presidential statement on Thursday, and will be in the presidency for the next five years.
Pakistan's television delivered a live ceremony that took place in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharaf promised to protect the institution and strengthen the good people.
In the middle of his office of senior military commander, he handed his trust to Ashfaq Kiyan, who was under international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after the bloodless military revolution gained power, the former general of the state first as the head of the civilian state.
By leaving the position of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharaf met one of the main requirements of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the elimination of the exceptional state that Musharaf declared on 3 November.
According to the top state representative of Malik Muhammad Qayuma, Musharaf is making an extraordinary position soon after his commitment, and is meeting the requirements of the West.
The highest court of the country, which, following the declaration of the exceptional status at the beginning of November, founded it on his designated lawyers, closed all disputes over the restoration of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed at the attack on the military army in the territory of the north of Vaziristan and four others were injured.
The talking army indicated that the bomb blew up on the train near the border with Afghanistan.
The father's crook is coming back.
The famous German team of seventy years is playing again. Three of the members of the Harmonian group re-enacted their electronic synthesisers at the Berlin concert.
Revival will also include Live 1974, sisters from the most successful period of the cape.
In recent times, they've been much more prominent in foreign fields.
The alleged sensation then begins with the appearance of three sedentary gentlemen who at first seem to enjoy their dinners.
Everyone's got a box, a cable, and mostly buttons.
Thirty-nine-year-old Dieter Moebius is sitting in the middle of snow.
After his left, he's a 17-year-old Michael Rother who has a laptop and a guitar.
The thirty-first-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who focuses on the synthesiser, is from the sight of the monsters right.
Everyone sings sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, of course, a lack of action will result in a traditional fund.
It doesn't seem to be too much for the singers.
Among the lovers, he called for a revision of the Harmonian Capules of a significant solution.
One thing stands out here. Repeated questions have shown that this name network is part of the collective knowledge of the pope, but it's definitely not so far as anyone has been ill-treated for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't Germany celebrate its still living legends for seventy years?
And especially when you're a music-style, rather called krutrock, in England and in America, you're worth more than in your own country.
When the music industry gave the remaining members of the Canco group the prize of Echo for the work of life in 2003, the team was full of challenging views of the German pop fans.
When Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu groups for their appearance, he no longer knew the miracle of the monsters.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts with them sat on the bridge as their old friend.
The problem of homelessness and devotion in foreigners is one thing.
Looking back on the Harmonian hat, we are deeply disturbed by the fact that this trio existed only two years ago, and at the same time, there was no such effect as others later read.
Moebius and Rodelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name of a promising cluster.
At first they played in the castle of the Berlin Wall of Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons in the gramphone company led by the church.
Rother soon joined the Kraftwerk group, however, the story gained as a guitarist in the Capeli Neu!, which at that time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother was followed by the musicians capely clustered into the Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, the 16th century, they lived as members of the municipalities that were expelled from the city.
They didn't live here as ideological as in Communist I, where Rodelius was still supposed to steal as a hook.
It was a better life in such a Spitzegwegnian art building.
The name for the art is dated from the name of the Confederal Congregation of Harmonia Ottenstein, whose record is dated in the spring.
A lot of the Harmonies have been saved.
The first album was called "Hood of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music was so quiet and modest, she endured financial difficulties.
The collection of growth was not just a matter of self - recognition.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was first held in the concert in Grissem before a record of a small, almost fifty-six-six-six.
Rothera has recently expressed her wish that the members of the Harmonies be excited and, as a matter of fact, cheered up.
For Rodlia and Moebia, it was simply an unsolicited demand.
In 1975 the Capella announced her divorce.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and assured his future by the album "The Heart of the Heart."
Chapel Cluster has lived again in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than when Harmonia was.
As a live album from Grissemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland took care of Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Chapel Neu! was then considered Roedeli's solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonius will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The event within the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly monitored.
Next to Brit, Julian Cope, the old pancake and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
He's also involved with the Founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
That's where we've planned a whole wide-ranging impact on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled with harmony.
Briana Enen's victory performed by these most beautiful sounds is called in the hall "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures on which the manufacturer from Harmonium is at the agricultural seat.
It also contributes to the creation of legend to the sale of other black photographs on which the seeds of the shared cables are planted.
Before they are three vitiated again, they are improvisations.
I'm no longer putting the microphones on the walls and bubbles, so that they'll ever come out of the tools that have never heard of self-contained tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three-to-one puncture techniques.
It doesn't change anything about the World's Culture House.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, the sound of the squeaks and in one beautiful place the emphatic sings "Aaaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English idea.
It's never been about rock.
The roots are more than found in the blues in the music schools (Can), in the technology (Kraftwerk) or in the run-up to the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls this place '68!' is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia is not even going to let it go.
And it's the most obvious thing to think about on the scene.
Where does the song start and when it ends?
This question is whether a person is prepared for the nerves or before he is able to survive the moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not racist enough.
With the introduction of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about war in the Balkans appeared right now.
But not one of them is convincing.
The proposal of the film is either too much to bet and shoot, or they're too clever.
The Hunting Party doesn't forget the kind of hero Richard Gere is.
The good news is as first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the western lands of the Bosen War, here is Richard Gere Octne.
In recent years, we have lost this most beautiful man for eight decades, not only because he played in many favorite, trivial roles in the wedding women's films, but in association with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, man will enjoy another movie with this priest.
And yet Richard Gere is one of the strongest arguments for tracking The Hunting Party - Where does the lover become useful (Why should film names be so long and complicated today?)
Gere is a military reporter, Simon Hunt, based on whom Gere could become, if the judge and the film industry were not so kind: a man who has his best years behind him for a long time, but as a few similar memories he still maintains a certain remarkable move.
But despite this trumpet, The Hunting Party is together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the kine this week, just by continuing the endless series of successful films on the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who are saving the Serbian girl from the Kosovo bomber, one of whom loves her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television movie is becoming too fast in shooting and action.
From the film, there's something much like the series of the Cobru 11, net without distance, but it's war.
In the film The Hunting Party, we can briefly examine why the Balkans War has not been able to capture a really good film.
The experience of three U.S. war reporters who appear to be a "blasphem", a Serbian top war criminal, to become a new "Apocalypse" in another time and under the leadership of another director and scenarioist (here is both Richard Shepard).
However, both stories seem surprising: small groups go to the forest to do something that is not military enough, but their path becomes a road to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the film The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the only jealous and sensitive kinician represented at the outset.
On the contrary, the proposal also presupposes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party's final payout, after which reporters in the last five minutes of the film are told what NATO, CIA and all the hunters of the world in the last five years did not tell: to catch the crime and leave it fair instead of the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of film creation that it's still going to turn to the International Court of Justice in Haagu.
Right now, this movie has the deepness of the human message.
It argues that Karadić and Mladic are still free, and suspects the Americans and Francoze (then they are extremely united) that on the basis of secret political agreements, they do not blame the pursuit of a sufficient extent.
But the good and the bad are sometimes like that, the woman is attacking us by Brecht's boss.
It refers to the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the work desk of the writer: "I feel like I'm looking at a quick smile on my face, a note: how evil it's supposed to be."
In films such as The Hunting Party, exactly such moving heads, but they indicate how they are capable of being good.
This problem is not limited to the war in the Balkans.
Recently it was written in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq have been successful.
This can be added only: No good film about South Africa has ever been filmed yet.
Nearly always pays: When the star moves through the crisis area or goes through the mini field, such as Rangoon with Patrick Archette, the Border of Evil with Angelino Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapri.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to run ten years before Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must obviously be viewed - films that are considered to be classic Vietnamese today - "Love Jelenos", "Apocalypsa" or "Apocalypse Vestas" - were not then celebrated as mystical works.
But maybe today, when every mass murder takes place at home right now on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The scanners then do not have the ability to convey the good news without a doubt.
"Be or not" or "Great dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe a man shouldn't want to be good when he wants to make good movies.
It may have to create a sarkastic artistic view as a novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was staged on a parallel between his historical novels "Lemprire's Dictionary" and "Balkan War", he declared, "The kind of thing is only that things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and war in Yugoslavia will always be."
Von Beust approaches the criticism of the Olympics
The retirement of the elderly from the organisation of the annual Olympics in Hamburg has resulted in a sudden policy and economic crisis.
A lot of people want to keep fighting to get her to the water.
Von Beaust, but he's going to be realism in the way of a chance.
The main business director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, pointed out in the middle this decision "from the point of view of the accident".
No other project has recently been implemented in the city as a great motivation as an Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sports political superiority at such a high level."
Schmidt-Trenz called upon the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for him, "which comes from a modified time plan."
Old Ole von Beust remained in the middle of his earlier announcements, according to which the Olympic ambition of Hamburg is not realistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports League is decisive about the Olympic candidate," said von Beaust to the newspaper WELT Online.
He showed that at the beginning of the December, the Sports Council decided on Mnichov's candidate for winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 schedule."
Yet he hasn't finished this dream yet, said von Beaust.
The Hamburg Sports Council (HSB) marked von Beautov for policymaking.
I'll bet Hamburk doesn't want to come in the next twenty-five years to organize Olympics.
"It is still too early to destroy the chance that plans are already marked as buried in this early phase," said the middle president of HSB, Günter Ploss.
On the contrary, it would be contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate that led to the ruling meeting of the General German High School Sports Council.
Von Beust here has not declared the candidate from Hamburg to the University in 2015 as a reward for organizing the Olympic Games.
The High School Sports Council of Hamburg first appointed the candidate city in the last week.
The SPD Group in the Hamburg Parliament of Senat found that it was a valuable time that could be used to build houses in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was early in the autumn, because he set up the Olympics and the building of the houses," SPD envoys Carol Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region was still planning the Olympics with the fact that the whole area will be later used for the housing purposes, the CDU unanimously focused on the "olimpic factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympic Games event marked a great increase in its time in Hamburg.
Hamburg, but he spent his life on Lipska.
It's not Warholov's tie.
The one who combines the words of Sweden and the wooden baths, doesn't mean Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or what?
The trees produced in Sweden at the present time are on the list of dark walls of Warholov.
Most of it on the list of 19 "Brillo Boxes" type Stockholm are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the rights of the Warholov "Brillo Boxes" in 1968, an internal research of the Museum of Modern Museum in Stockholm comes with the result of disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Museum of Moderna gave the gift to its former director, Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm, which are on the international art market.
The previous events are complex, deadly series of artistic and curatorial actions.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, cut down the wooden beds that were based on the red-moded design of the paper boxes of Brillo's soft powder.
The exhibition of his work in Modern Museum in 1968 presented - with Warhol's agreement - the hundreds of Brillo bets from the card. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were supplied directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about art, but about their proposals, it was just a showcase.
Warhol evidently granted permission in 1968 also to make several wooden Brillo bedens in Sweden, but they are not displayed in Modern Museum.
Closer witnesses now talk about the fifteen baths, which are currently entitled to art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" marking Type Stockholm.
Some of them were spent on auctions in excess of $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Museum of Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made in Sweden and set up about a hundred bendens that Warhol left.
In fact, 105 Hulten's beads were manufactured in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrohrad first in 1990.
Warhol's been dead for three years now.
Lars Byström, the top conservator Moderna Museet, examined in addition to six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after which their transparent panels were made of a base colour and covered, the victim was painted with oil white.
On the contrary, from the structure of a copy from 1990 it was discovered that the color was painted without the previous basic form of painting directly on the surface – in addition to the acrylic and not the oil color.
"These beds were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from Warholov's official Brillo box," the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve said: "If the organisation of Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to another conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to classify six members of its exhibitions as "a copy".
Already in July, the Organisation of Authentication Board announced that these "serious charges" raised in the matter would be put to death by the mouthpiece.
But the organization's still in vain for a long time.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers, who rebuilt one hotel in Manila, called for the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The director of the rebels, Antonio Trillanes, who spoke to the president of manipulation and corruption during the elections, told the reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
The government's troops had previously opposed the discovery of a silhouette in the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two tenths of the soldiers returned to the building.
On Thursday, almost half of them stood before the court because of the attempted conversion in 2003, including Trillanes.
A meeting was used to raise about 30 sympathetic people.
The soldiers who were supposed to watch him apparently crossed his side and joined in the resistance.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and requested the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government's loyal units closed the area around the hotel.
The president approved the emergency session of the security office.
The National Security Council of Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of soldiers.
"People already have enough," said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, head of former elite unit Scout Rangers, said that there will be more military units to come in a short time.
Critics of the governments called for a great demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been counting corruption for months.
The Manila financial area has already become the main cause of attack by about 200 soldiers against Arroy in 2003.
Because she refused to join the army, she was forced to spend the last 24 hours.
Since 1986 at least seven times in the Philippines have tried to overthrow a democratically elected government.
The United Internet Company becomes the majority of Versatel shareholders
The United Internet has ensured more than a dozen percent share in Versatel's telecoms company.
The average bidder announced that the average share price was EUR 14,46.
The company currently owns 20,05 % of the basic share capital.
Previously, it had been speculated about taking over.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increase in its share in Versatel.
The United Internet announced that this step is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After the Bank of Berenberg increased its share in the company of this Diesseldorfs operator of the network by another 5 % to 15,1 %, the entry agreement was published in the medium.
In the financial market, it is claimed that this financial institution only maintains shares for the third party.
Last night, the United Internet was in Drillish company, which was already nearly 10% shared by mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the increase in capital, Drillish provided additional 17.4 million new shares at EUR 106.4 million.
Of these, 5,15 million shares were purchased by EUR 31,4 million.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in DSL products and mobile networks together.
"We are strengthening our partnership," the speaker of the United Internet explained.
In order to take over Freenet’s competitive company, the joint ventures were set up by the MSP.
On Thursday, the United Internet announced that both companies in Freenet would be in a position of more than 10 % in time and would not exercise their right to transfer 18,49 % to this company.
It is because companies are still leaving all open opportunities, especially the possibility to further increase their share in Freenet AG.
The discussions between the United Internet and Freenet regarding the strategic partnership were closed in mid-November.
For months now, the game on Freenet has been a part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract customers on the mobile network and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische dosed in Freenet held 6.01% part.
Now it was agreed that Drillish would get about 4% more.
The right to purchase 18,49 % of Vatas’ investment company was already agreed in August.
