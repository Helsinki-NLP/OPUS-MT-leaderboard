The Prague Börse attacks against business closures in the minus.
After the sudden fall in the morning, the Prague Börse could correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal business.
The Prague Börse was linked at the beginning of the day's business to the introduction of the Monday, when they gave up another six percentage points.
This time there was the reason for entering the Wall Street.
In Chechnya, the market's reaction to the result of the vote of the American representative house, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector in question, is also shown in the Czech Republic.
Whether the action is enabled.
A dramatic event occurred on the day of the service, while the indexes could match some of the losses during the day.
The index of Hong Kong Seng Börse lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later some of the losses could be made, thus reducing the return to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Song China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares at the pool in Hong Kong, amounted to 3.8 per cent, were closed in Shanghai.
The shares at the pool in Sydney have lost more than five percent, but then the losses have decreased to 4.3 percent.
According to the present index, the beer in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent.
"The timing for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and the financial markets will be affected worldwide," said the Chief of Finance in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong is determined, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, so independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong move to the same level as those in the United States.
The US legislators should, as soon as possible, return to the negotiating table and adopt the draft for support of the financial system as soon as possible, as possible.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the interference.
A bloodbath of American shares
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial support plan on Monday, for which up to $700 billion (up to 12 billion Kč) should be set up.
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush's view of the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a bloody bath on Monday, and the most important stock index recorded the largest intrusion in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index gave about seven percent, a similar intrusion he recorded last in 1987.
The index was already broken before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not be carried out in the House of Commons, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes agreement: U.S. government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
This should be agreed at the beginning of the next week.
The U.S. legislators reached a gap in the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system in a total of $700 billion (about $12 billion).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
The members of the Congress must, in particular, consider some further details of the agreement before they can publish the Constitution and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday this was said by the Chairman of the Committee for Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, different details could probably be agreed on the plan earlier this Wednesday.
Economies should follow a communication on the adoption of the plan, which is the first significant psychological factor for financial markets.
However, it comes to a "response" because of the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on how to look at a package for the stabilization of the market," the Democrat Nancy Pelosi said to the agency Bloomberg.
As a result, your words could still come to a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to provide the government fund with its final form.
This provides for the purchase of non-commercial mortgage assets by financial companies that damage financial firms in serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You still have to continue the healing plan, but I think we're the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly low in the stock markets, which are very low.
The words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, have succeeded in reaching a final agreement on Sunday before the convention.
That is why it is important to discourage investors from business in the Asian financial markets that lie in the first time zone where a decision of the Congress could affect business on Monday.
As long as it is not quite clear, when both of the members of the American Congress are voting on the law, it is also clear whether negotiations in the last minute could not be dealt with in a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will still be subject to some changes.
The total amount allocated to the system should be divided into two parts.
The original 350 billion dollars will be provided as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the discharge of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, in other than $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush values progress in negotiations positive
However, the President has a veto right in this decision, but the Congress can agree with his veto.
Despite these changes, however, there have been the reasons for the programme, which is based on the fact that funding for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, has been obtained because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush also showed satisfaction with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush would be satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and "appropriate both efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden random screens
The President of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the leading contractor, admitted that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of the taxpayer against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also restrict the gold-plated case screens for directors of companies involved in the programme and establish a committee to oversee the Fund.
This should lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates with a help for home owners who have problems with the return of their mortgage.
The government should deal with new rates of mortgages that it purchases, where the objective is to reduce the monthly costs for the debtor and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why, because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses," Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week, according to Marek's view, it is not exclusive.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as quickly as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to adoption is now the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Double on Messers Cut: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any phone MP3 file can be played, there is still no MP3 player to play.
So, of course, it seems better to buy just a phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons for why you should assign yourself a own player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and demands of the future owners.
You will find it difficult to buy a great expensive plate player for home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it either.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in general, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also easy to express with music on travel, so with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For the one, it may not be acceptable to give out a player a dozen crowns, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably force headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each room.
The selection is wide.
The life span of the batteries is also decisive.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what they can't even create a way of doing it.
No modern device is to use as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the symphony, it can repeat music and videos, both of which have a better one, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to browse.
And if you still include the smartphones and communications, you have almost a small computer in the bag.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV photograph.
However, the universality of the telephones also brings some benefits.
The more you use your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy coolers.
Only a few phones can play music longer than ten to ten hours, but it's usually much less.
In this regard, Music Player (specially the easiest) are the most powerful players.
That is why you should count on cheap phones so that they can no longer play music for more than a few hours.
Then, if you turn off and call again, you can buy for safety another charging device for the office - that is also applicable to expensive devices.
When MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep up at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one load.
Another problem is if you want to play music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the device has a USB closure, and not every phone can connect directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card reading devices will be completed without reduction with the win-winning memory cards that are used on phones.
You don't need any special software until you're on iPod.
You only need to feed the device through USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players even place a music library, depending on the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only form the structure of the address list, like the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephone with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
In selecting a specific device, you should explore, in particular, after the lifetime of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also the service comfort.
If you have music for you, above all, and listen to them every day just briefly in the street, then there's enough phone for you to play MP3 files.
What really can almost every phone can do?
You don't have to check in particular which music formats can process a phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get will just be in this format.
The format belongs to the most popular, and in addition most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format, the Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to call the relevant pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can already be a powerful argument for why a musical hand should be attached.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is bad and is often limited only to fast radio.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is clear that this kind of sale of music (such as GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will in the future be controlled by the music industry.
The phone takes most of them.
If you're lucky to listen to something, pick up the phone in the jackent bag while the player is home.
However, it is clear whether you are also a headphone or at least a free speech system.
If not, you can get back to the integrated speakers, which has almost every phone, but only the smallest MP3 player.
The greatest benefit of the music hands is to many in the price.
The cheapest prices are normally less than three thousand crowns.
For three and a half thousand crowns, you have already got a very decent Walkman.
The largest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are there.
The best and technically equipped telephones with a 3.5-mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The player's advantage is again in the easy service.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar to those used with the previous normal tape recorder or, for example, the disc player is obvious.
There is no collition in the form of an irrefutable mobile Internet and a subsequent ascending account for data transmission.
Which device should be connected now
Also the most cheap phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy an appropriate card, there are two thousand crowns.
But look.
In the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive 8-GB memory cards can be read.
If you already have a phone and you want to buy a priced MP3 player, then you can get to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
If you are able (max. 2 GB) then you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you belong to the demanding ears, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have their own MP3 service keys, and the service comfort comes to the individual MP3 player.
The top is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interfaces as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category from up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (normally 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) provide you with the MP3 player of the manufacturer mentioned above.
The first virtual tenderer is already in this year after Chechnya.
Maybe
The mobile service market in Chechnya is right, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is a lack of something here - a virtual provider that demands the classic prices to lower.
Maybe this won't be waited a long time.
That the Czech mobile service providers are working at the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on mobile.cz.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÜ Telecommunications Authority, which pointed out that the price for a SMS here is higher than the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges, it is likely that a paradox situation - for some of the Czech mobile providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that the prices in Czechs are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a struggle.
Maybe it sounds paradox, but in Czech there are three mobile networks and a penetration of more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators would like to know that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÜ) Paul Dvorák, who in the past had often argued that there was no place for another provider in Chechnya.
It is likely that a classic provider with a own network no longer has many special opportunities (otherwise, he would probably not find even more frequencies).
But there is still an opportunity - a virtual provider.
As a result of the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market, there was a significant price adjustment with which the classic mobile providers also had to respond.
Before the entry into force of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain, there were similar votes in Czech.
But it has shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
Otherwise, you don't have to look for examples for a long time.
In February this we reported on the start of the virtual provider mobileking in Poland.
In just a half year, this provider was able to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus increase to the country’s fifth largest bidder.
Last mobile is the Penta Financial Group, which is located in Chechnya under another U:fon.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need a lot less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost of building, operating and maintaining a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually go out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers at least half the price of SMS in Britain as its competitors.
However, as the example of mobileking in Poland shows, it can also be a good look to set a non-clicking target group.
This provider refers specifically to men.
"The real core choose mobile - the provider who loves and trusts them," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could be drawn in Poland as well as in Chechnya.
In addition, the press speaker from Vodafone Miroslav Čepicý says: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment based on which most virtual suppliers are.
Furthermore, he has been relatively adjusted from the point of view of the service provision."
In Chechnya there's no chance, I mean the mobile phone providers.
But it's almost certain that, if a virtual mobile provider gets a Czechia, it won't be a mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in Czech are not particularly promising.
It will become more and more a market presence of mobileking in other countries of our region," says Jana Studničková, Press Speaker of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile service providers in Chechnya are not particularly attracted to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor exists.
Your interest at the start of a virtual mobile provider has been shown for a long time by the GTS Novera Group, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest not only in providing our customers with fixed network, but also mobile telecoms services.
And you're early, that's better.
This opportunity has been discussed again with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we were already able to make negotiations," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times come now.
Non-official information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
Until long, however, this is surrounded by an unsurpassed wall of the Swiss.
"At this moment we do not conclude that there is a place in Chechnya for a full virtual provider.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
Until long no subject has been addressed with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršön in his statement for mobile.cz Vlastimil Sršön from the press department of Telefónica O2.
In the Czech market specificities also show additional suppliers.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in a rare manner with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to be built on."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobiles, a virtual provider will not appear until the end of the year.
At this point we must already have a concrete offer to think so briefly."
Vodafone focuses on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický means: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, particularly in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We considered this to be the best view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the suppliers
The performance of mobile service providers is easy to understand, a further provider was more competitive, which would result in lower prices and also a return of profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor facilitate market access?
That the offerers can draw on a strangler when it comes to something, is also the long hint and the owner about the creation of U:fon.
The most powerful pressure in the direction of ČTÜ went to the time when U:fon came to the market, from T-Mobile company.
This is also the public information available on the ČTU websites.
But now it is just U:fon as an argument why a virtual provider should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently strengthened by the market presence of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new operator would make high requirements for the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not just about the attitude of ČTÜ, which in Czech leaders - in contrast to the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the ability to engage in economic competition.
This only holds the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this whole problem has its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after it has reached a contract agreement between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
Until then, no such agreement has been concluded because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers," so in response to our request Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the UOHS.
This would not be surprising by the representatives of the tenderer.
This is more than a matter of concern to an authority that represents the consumer's interests and, among other things, that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be noted that their market presence has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market is not due to the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, it is quite shocking that the three mobile phone providers who respond to these reactions have nearly been able to respond.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is on hand.
Just as the absolute same gas price at the tanks is likely only to fall and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence in this regard referring to an anti-competitive action, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile service market for virtual providers are probably also missing the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÜ, following telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers have a dominant position inside.
However, some legal experts offer another view - for the market access of a virtual provider, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has the monopol for his network.
This means that he takes a dominant position in a particular segment as necessary.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile operators are acting similarly.
There are complaints from a number of stakeholders (including the said company GTS Novera) that they stand in very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The deduction of the responsibility to the ČTÜ is then a legitimate trick in telecommunications services, which distances the ÜOHS from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been achieved in the recently adopted novels of the telecommunications law to extend the ČTÜ's competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS need to know this only too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's already gone if no one's hiding.
It remains unattended for the first time the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are even more than one in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services that are only partially public.
It is normally about companies that act in the field of multilevel marketing.
Personal mobile telephone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only to be selected.
The whiteness of the matter is that the company acts against the operator as a classic company client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, you will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers prohibit a similar type of further sale.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a breach of the contractual conditions with which we will then be dealt with, which can lead to an end of cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrová answered our question.
It is, however, quite unlikely that such a thing does not happen to those responsible for mobile phones.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers can be treated.
No operator, however, is opposed to such a procedure.
From the activities of these companies, they are not being affected by the actual official market at the same time, unlike the actual virtual suppliers.
Miroslav Čepický notes on possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a very low percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM cards do not run on their name on their phone, so they cannot fully have them as the normal customers of mobile phone providers."
But that's the only thing the ČTU had to do at least rarely.
In addition, another question arises for the UOHS.
Before such an event, the mobile phone providers decide to close their eyes to a virtual provider.
It is also true that the EAGGF has a strong competence to detect such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the supplier's statement that they were not aware of it and would not be satisfied with their business conditions.
When Chess is no longer the most expensive one
As already stressed in the text, the market presence of virtual suppliers brought a significant price decline in the various services.
In all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their creation practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a rather small, or very low market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which are not necessarily the interests of mobile phones providers, are seeking to prove their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and continued to do so.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are trying to treat the whole case like a hot cardboard.
As far as our experiences are concerned, we cannot express the impression that incompetence in these cases is more valuable than clarity.
But we're not going to cast the flint into the crown.
If the background information is heard and a virtual provider is soon discovered, the Czech mobile market may soon be re-inforced.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to recommending other stakeholders (to discriminate).
And then the Czechs will finally stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best out
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymme.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek announced on the occasion of the day of the Czech state in one hour the new recording of the Nationalymne Where is my home country.
The Hymne was recently played by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jírí Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologe, in chorfasing and in an instrumental version.
The song record was taken by Katerírina Knížínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymnen versions are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can also listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech National League is one of the most beautiful Himms.
He had already told the Czech roundfunk that he had chosen for the solo-variant singers with young, representative voices that are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried both and then with the chor to keep a clear diction so that you understand the text well so that an argument arises," said the director.
In the next year, the Czech Nationalymne has 175. Jubiláum.
The song Kde domov explained my first time in 1834 at the stage of the station theater in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from Frantisšek Škroup.
It was popular, and people adopted it spontaneous.
The first strip of the League became an organic part of the National Hymme in 1918 after the birth of Chechoslovakia.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained after the creation of the Czech Republic itself.
How the "new" hyms sound
The Prague transport companies are transporting on Wednesday for the first time on a chip.
The Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter into the history of the Prague transport company as a date to which the first passengers in a bus, road or bus are admitted to an electronic coupon instead of a paper show.
These can now buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (full from 1 January 2009) and play this on their chip cards at the same time, including in the Info Centres and Bicycles of the transport companies at the U.S. stations Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letjány, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the website of the transport company www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was applied by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the U-roads, where they had to wait regularly for long-term delays on their paper traffic.
They buy the Copon on the Internet, which is played on the opencard in one of the thirty-seconds of the city library.
"In these places, the travelers also have a lock with dedicated staff, who consults on the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," said project speaker Martin Oppatrní.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can also be played on the opencards that have been added to some U-Bain valves.
How do such automatics look?
They are red, remind of the train tickets, the passengers may already have noticed in Roztyly, Budějoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of these in the city, but it should be eight years," adds Opatarní.
The coupon controls instead of the driver an automatic
The operation of the machines that will be operated from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to enter the chip map, and the previously acquired coupon is on its own.
The electronic coupons apply from morning to morning not only in the capital but also in the environment.
So in the capital cities and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, the inhabitants of the region's central mountains arrived mainly in the capital city.
"In the trains that are part of the integrated transport to Prague, the accompanying reading devices with which they can check the validity of the Copons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Organisation Ropid. This organisation combines the road plans for the Prague transport companies.
The president's buses have card reading devices on the case at the driver's seat.
The chip card must be displayed not only on the driver but the open card must be placed at a marked location on the side of the box.
In this way the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a driver checks the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than the driver's request for this information," Drápal said.
A journey that does not run with urban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon is over can go back to the self-service cars where the coupons are played on the map.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Saudis asked the United States for a People's Decision
In 1945, the southern Germans had sought to conquer the Böhmerwald in the United States.
This is from a letter that is stored in the collections of the scientific library in South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the U.S. government.
With such a wish, some groups of South-West Germans should have joined the US Presidents in 1945.
This is included in a letter that has been received in a private archive and is preserved today in the collections of the South-West Science Library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American Presidents in writing that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich Agreement by Hitler - to the Czech Republic.
"We have correctly understood the situation and want to be sure that the American units are not in German territory as underpressors and enemies, but as freer," says a letter signed with the words "People whose destiny is in the heart of the South."
In view of the fact that the association with the Czechs with the Czechs - in recognition of the Czech national character - convinces them that they would expect brutality, incompatibility, incompatibility, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter asks the American Presidents to take over the Böhmerwald protection for today and forever.
"We can't believe that without returning to the sight of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you can speak to a foreign country for us, stressing the minorities and trying to eliminate them, and has not contributed anything to the victory of the allies," says the letter.
The reason why the authors are unable to sign is apparently the fear of the list of the "schemic underpressors".
If the U.S. President had doubts about the opinion of the Böhmerwaldwaldwich, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants of the United States wanted to become part of the United States or to live under the protection of the United States.
While the text of the letter in today's postwar history may sound somewhat naive, it is, in the opinion of some newspapers, a good picture of the expectations of the Southern Germans at the time.
Even if the native Germans had to at least not know that they would be dealt with about their expulsion from the Republic, only a few of them had such an opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would deal with some sort of autonomy for the South.
Still others believed that they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as Budweiser Germaner at the sea on the east coast.
When he arrived at the end of the war in British prisons and was taken to Holstein in a war camp, thousands of other Buddhist Germans came to him, and he was going to bring them Czechs.
"They believed that if they came home, they would be able to pass through the Czechs," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who had lived before the war in Chechoslovakia expressed his opinion that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Benez decree.
You don't think so.
An emotional campaign is directed to car drivers
The most deadly action on the streets in the Czech history.
Similarly, the emotional campaign was characterised by the media campaign that wanted to start the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš Rébeček agrees to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the lenkrad.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, on the cinema, on the Internet, but also on planes.
You should take the driver out of a fast way and alcohol tax.
And they also remember to wake up before driving.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and not only professionals.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidence of the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think so.
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a label.
And then in a cup of blood, the word "sacrifice".
This should mean that you can pay a moment indiscriminately with your own life.
The spots will be "shocking" by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English-speaking countries where you can see very normal images with dramatic recording of accidents.
It is promised to reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic accidents on the Czech streets.
The spots were compiled by the Agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar broth and peats for car drivers
"For the driver, the motto is suitable for sugar broth and peitsche.
Sugar break means, for example, that if they drive to red, they save time.
The peitsche is then the throttle of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in the press and, above all, negative advertising, it means psychology.
Its opinion is less effective than tables that alert the drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns of a danger, they will probably be in contact with the environment soon, and the drivers will not take them anymore," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke practically for the return of all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan mountains, when it could be concluded in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He emphasized this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (set) areas, if not all," said Olmert against the newspaper.
"We maintain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli territories) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He indicated that any return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Those who want security in Jerusalem and, above all, do not want tractors or bulldozer to play their own role as a best friend, will have to ignore a part of Jerusalem," observed Olmert, reflecting on two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and thousands were wounded.
According to the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historic places" located on the territory of the old city.
"Those who want to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he further confirmed.
Derogation of the Golan height
Olmert spoke for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which he considered to be an unforgettable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require certain efforts on the pages of Damascus.
"My proposal does not allow Syria alone and only on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan heights of peace," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians only know how well they have to forget to get back to the Golan heights.
They will have to forget their present relationship with Iran; they will have to forget their relationship to the (Schiitish) Hisbollah movement; they will have to forget their constant support for the terrorism of the (Schiitish) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Dschihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister specified.
Question after accident: Are Stewarts illegal in the bus?
The law doesn't know, in a remote bus it's not allowed to travel
In relation to the tragic accident of a bus from the student agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewart and travelers can drive and drive along the bus.
"If we want to keep the law strictly and formally, then the work of a Steward is against road traffic law," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, the last week of a two-hundred-year-old Stewartess about life, was probably caused by the driver of the LKW, who crossed the road.
The young woman at this moment was at all the accident near the driver, at the least safe place in the car, even though she had two more places available.
However, a bus may also have an accident at the moment, or it may be short, in which the Stewart coffee or newspapers are placed.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with seat belts.
If this is not foreseen in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The railway buses of Student Agency have no support; what the director of the company, Radim Jançura, confirmed against Aktualnnö.cz.
"This has been discussed with the Ministry, and this has not initially agreed with the movement of passengers.
It was later taken back, and we have reached a consensus that passengers should go to the toilets when they have their seating place," he shared his position.
The law doesn't know a Stewart.
"There is no clear legal explanation for the role of a Stewart - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the meaning of vehicles; however, it does not define their rights and obligations," adds the Minister of State Hanzelka's speaker.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Joseph Pokorný argues that the law covers these problems overnight.
"It comes to the fact that the bus in the product authorisation also has seats.
That's all, then," he stressed.
Buses are divided into urban bus where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, transport buses with parking spaces and a higher permitted speed and travel buses without parking with the highest permissible speed and seating conditions.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP-Fachmann for Transport Safety Jaroslav Horín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewarts on a bus board.
"In a flexible route, there are no many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on the board of a plane.
Even here it's not safe when turbulence comes, and the Stewartess can stop the head."
"But at least a bus drove, then, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or on a street road.
The safety of the Stewarts must be clear by internal regulations," he says, and he also believes that this problem will not be solved in full from the view of the law.
Jançura is ready to provide services
Student Agency offers as the only bus company services by Stewart.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession to be risky even after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that the profession of Stewart is risky, I'll beat him.
Coffees and newspapers can be obtained by guests.
This would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of Stewarts in his bus. But his company only serves a fraction of lines compared to the student agency.
"We don't have any guards, however, we've been against us from the beginning.
Earlier or later this ends with any fatal accident," he did not say a whole year ago for Týden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the fall of a line bus to Neapel, a young Stewartess from the Pilsen region who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian LKW was probably unblinked and stopped the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to get out of a sharp mannover, but collated with the right advantage with the LKW.
That the two places have been sold for the Stewarts, Jancura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to apologize to the LKW drivers.
The Agency is not waiting for a fine for the young woman's family, but it is also awaiting a financial fine on the part of the debtor.
A change of law?
Not in view
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewart on a bus board could bring about a legal arrangement in which a thirty-pound expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not subject to the agenda, rather than the point system, the maximum speed on the road and the use of telephones on the road," says Fachmann Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the work of the Stewarts to be something that could seriously endanger the safety of travelers," says Hanzelka, in which control of the safety of buses is in the competence of the police and the labour security authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB state does not miss the staff of the house.
By bringing together the units of the Düsseldorf Geldinstitut with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Financial Group", it is the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable acquisition power in such a business.
And in any case, such a link could be a decisive obstacle to further links in the banking sector.
This is the case if a Board wishes to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the attached WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Service Supervisory Authority, which the Government of the North Rhine-Westphalia has recently made it clear that it is time to find a solution to the future.
From a closely linked relationship between the Deka Bank, which is always known for its investment funds, and the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on Frankfurter page.
Since Deka-Bank Chief Franz Waas has been informed by the submission of the half-year-old accounts at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Land Street with a bank, i.e. the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is assigned to half of the banks and savings bonds, has commissioned the Board to conduct talks with the WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks were free, so it was called at the financial scene, just beginning.
From the Deka Bank, which numbers with its 3000 employees to the most important employers in Frankfurt, it is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the fragment sector.
In 2003 it appeared a moment as long as the Deka Bank could merge with the Rhineland Bank and Helaba.
However, nothing was made of this triangular bond.
As soon as the plans were made public, the German Government spoke against the participation of Helaba.
Even the two other houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz took place at Baden-Württemberg Landesbank in Stuttgart.
However, it has repeatedly given ideas about a link between the Deka bank and the Landesbanks.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, President of Helaba, spoke against plans for a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to be learned that a summary of the different houses of the public-law sector needs to be done.
After the country's election in Bayern is over, a connection between BayernLB and the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank could be restored as a first link to the Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
Should the pressure increase further mergers, you should go to and after the partner.
In the south, she would only be a Junior partner, although she has had a lot better financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A meeting with the West LB has again proposed a line at the beginning of the year, with 85 per cent participating in the Helaba Sparta and Giroverband Hessen-Thuringen.
In any case, stay the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one page.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl, the decisive question with which business model to ensure the future of the Land Banks, was not answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be an extension of the West LB, which, however, is not in itself desirable.
The same is true of the words in the letter of the Board of Directors, which, in any case, will mean a "total solution" for the house.
As the combination of individual units with the Deka bank under a hat will still show.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time already.
But this time Elena is his friend with it, and so be everything else, he says.
Behind them, at the 5-liter-beer phase of the Kaiser brand, there is a massive built-in barrier and proves the about 200 October-fested travelers, who can lift their keel tones.
Elena first gives Luca a cup, then a cup.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the porta Nuova train station starts at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "Destinazione Monaco, festival della Birra", expected to arrive at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are maintained mainly by the Italians, traveling in a bus only by Brazilians.
In a corner of the park, the South Americans already sang along their train, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long mantel with pelzimitate foot and a glasses with large silver beads, includes the buses.
For five years they've gone to the October festival, three Tours are alone in this year.
Night down, on the way back at 22.30 a.m.
Nights would mean only unnecessary food, Marco says.
75 Euro costs the train, the welcome tours with Kaiser-Bier, using the Bavarian cleaning offer, the health insurance and the German travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses are already rolling in the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, there's no beer.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus to sleep the passengers.
Well, they're still gonna need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and Woodskirchen, where several other buses with Italian brands on the road 8 shortly before Munich are still taking a break.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the park at half an hour in the morning near the Theresienvise, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First: Set up the yellow hat.
In this context, the internet address of Marcos Reisbüro is "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, and the internet address of Marcos Reisbüro: "konscersivijaggindo.it".
Second, "If the doors go up to the bierzel, it's going to run!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" running and occupying the places in the back of the cell.
"Not before, otherwise we block, and not all silver coins on the same banks, share in the space!"
The measure, Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the drink money.
"The security people show that we care well!
As soon as they leave their homes, they are gone.
Thirdly, "Weren't we going to find eleven again tonight?"
And it's already going to show.
On the way, a yellow hat binds as road markers to the trees, to the paintings and even to the electorate of a large Baerian people party.
You want to be armed for the return.
It's the second Swiss weekend known as "Italian weekend".
There are no precise data on numbers; the talk is of 50,000 people who walk across the Alps and fall into the bierzelte, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to be interested in this weekend extra from Italy.
The Munich Police will be strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, with Italian volunteers supporting the Bayerische Rote Cross, which leads to national statistics in which the Italians (about 60 units) and Austrians (about 80) have placed about 200 medical supplies in the first place.
The court is particularly popular in Italians.
Sleepless nights for believers in the Hippo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, stressed by Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good it was that the politician used the word "relativ" and even implied that the German banking sector would not disappear from crisis-related developments.
Because it's already on the weekend.
The Münchner Real Estate real estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from a German bank firm to withdraw from the turbulence in the markets.
Reuters said on Monday that credit aid amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should only be paid for the part which it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
Backgrounds are lost in the daughter of Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has spent money, the public finances have been extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of the misstraining on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve was reduced by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate was slightly increased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current income and net income from financial transactions were zero compared to the previous year, the income from claims for claims and certain securities, and the resolution of returns in credit transactions amounted to more than 70 per cent of EUR 5 million.
Only because of higher revenues from replacements from post-settled cost of restructuring of the former depfa group, as well as the replacement of interest under the Debt Regulation and from the management of business for Group Enterprises, the decrease in revenue was still moderated by around 16 per cent.
The former state financer had first consulted with commercial real estate credits after his privatization in 1990 which were then allocated to the Aareal Bank.
In view of the low value of the classic state funding, the Deffa had then increased its role in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community private investors and the State (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationalized.
The value of the daughter must now be made by the hypo Real Estate, which has a "significant material effect" on the profit and loss of the group, i.e. it is wrong to define it.
The fact is, the dividend was broken.
It was already cut by about two thirds in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financer since the depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on the financing of the interbank market, as it does not have customer facilities.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit burden on banks was reimbursed, as the banks claimed their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs some EUR 50 billion - of the Depfa credit portfolios short-term funding.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the financing needs of the group with the credit have been covered over over time and the company has been excluded from "from the impact of the highly functional international monetary markets".
From other sources, it is to hear that the money has been secured by the refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE President Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to take the money markets into account at a reasonable time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Service Supervisory Authority (BaFin) have concluded that the market capacity of the Hippo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is expected for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even surprising that funding does not have to be taken fully into account.
But the opposite is also not to be removed.
After the late Sunday afternoon, the company was still in front of the bank’s insolvency, it was also possible to save the farmers at least for a while.
The share rate amounts to 75 per cent of EUR 3.30.
However, the loan rates are well maintained.
When the previous debts are hardly shown, the courses of the next loans are more clearly defined.
In particular, the contributions of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and of course the running time beyond 2009.
As a speculative alternative to low-level mortgage loans, the value of the bank crisis and of the institution itself must be determined by the fact that the crisis had taken place in the home only after the stability of the international financial system had been taken into account.
As long as the note banks, governments and less-accompanied business banks are ready to support the system, the interest rate can be paid on a reasonable basis.
Or it comes to what no one can hope for today - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the overstated notifications, it is now only a legitimate hope from the safety-limited probability.
This should, above all, prepare some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term farmers can still use a loss contract for future payment payments on short-term loans.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of high school to introduce themselves to the Tachibana High School, the girls began to kiss: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first Saturday in Japan.
I was upset.
I've already had a bullet before school.
I live on the side of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes with the train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, I didn't have to run for happiness.
The beginning of education does not appear to be as strictly fixed in the Tachibana as in the case of us at home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o'clock until twenty-nine hours before a short discussion with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I'm not even the guy who wants to talk to people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I took an old rock from my host mother, which included blue, blue bone cramps and black leather shoes.
So on this occasion I put myself in front of the powder and tried to say the right thing: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I called Sylvana, come from Germany and have been born in one week.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all mixed, dressed and dressed and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the life-long word of Japanese girls and means 'good, sweet'.
Then I'll be in my place soon.
The girl beside me was quite wide, and she found it a privilege that the exchangers should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was relatively quiet, but when the gong fell, I was regularly shocked.
Everyone talked to each other and looked at me and asked me to put tears in my mouth - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of them packed out their bentos.
My host mother had also made me a lunchbox - that's sometimes something different than the sad German break break.
I had a trip with vegetables, small vegetables, salads from vegetables and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Mostly, I don't have a broken mirror, which I'm here in Japan.
Things look remarkable and taste completely new.
It turns out everything's really nice.
Naja, up to the salted flowers maybe, brrrrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a very prepared Bento, which then makes her very art - in the hope of getting to know the boys better during the break.
I've read about this in my Manga Comics.
I've been wondering if I can see it here too.
'Why does Japan deserve it?' asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
"I want to be fascinated now."
Finally, I've been reading the most popular Mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and culture, I also started to learn a little Japanese once again.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, seats and breasts.
And you put a great value on it here.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't been lost here yet, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
Does a race or a creature fly at risk mean that she also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check if they feel the same when they behave like we do?
In the Internet magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL Online presents in a selected series of answers to the question "What do you hold for, without proof?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other awareness, without being able to prove this or anyone else before, where we can never prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope that all human brains will have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we use other species and solve the issues of feeling or general awareness, we are inseparable countries because the hardware does not agree.
When a wheel is in danger, it is the same as many other animals: it stands up to, floats, or moves on.
People behave similarly, and some scientists end up with a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to convey our subjective experience to animals.
To one end, almost always associated with the human consciousness, the cell circuits are connected with the adjacent prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to miss out on other creatures.
At least those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, are therefore the reason for accepting that humans are even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic property must be in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it so that animal consciousness, as it may be, may be very different from most of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to detect how consciousness may appear in other animals.
If, as something inside and subjective, it is not yet measured, because of the special hardware, it is possible to analyse it through our own experience, we are facing major problems.
Most of my performances relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is yet another aspect of the consciousness which should be more easily accessible in science.
You could examine the consciousness processes of animals without turning your attention to their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly for the example of visualization.
However, in this approach, following the Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one is more focused on the core correlation of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the pre-frontal cortex for the state of visualisation.
What happens now to the feelings?
I bring it back to the fact that a emotional system like the fear is activated in a brain that is conscious of its own activity.
So what we refer to as "fright" is the mental condition in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain-localised reverse system (or its consequences, like physical reactions) is reflected in the working memory.
In this respect, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, the primates and in particular the people.
Related to the linguistic nature, there are fine cuts of feeling, because we can differentiate and categorize with the help of words and grammar skills to describe them in addition to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings of primitive activity in the body's sensitive regions of Cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Panksep, who focuses more on the brain.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human Evolution, it may be involved in overwhelming emotions.
Pure theoretically, I can't argue with him, but it's not clear.
Pankzep argues what appears to rats and humans as fear, probably also feels in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees to danger, even if it feels afraid?
In my eyes, only behaviour cannot prove any equal to experience.
However, the neurological comparison continues: rats and humans have similar stems, however, not even a brain.
But is the hip stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to people, how would you like to show it at advice?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), may have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are likely to differ fundamentally from those of us (because human consciousness is based on special spheres and language), I would like to explore the emotional behaviour than the emotional feelings of councils.
In any case, progress is being made at the nuclear level, if there is a lack of the same in the race and in the people.
As I do not study language and consciousness at councils, nor do I feel, I do not know whether they exist.
You can keep this for a while, but I'll be better off walking against a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Gnadenfrest für Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik said that the preparations would soon be made under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But this is no amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the time plan for building or building the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two guests will be in the background.
It is possible that even the number of EM stations will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work at the highest speed now," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us in mind."
A further radical step was decided in Poland.
PZPN's leadership is suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and was replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious risk that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not be delayed."

Emmerter Dennis Quaid throws back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and now she's worried about the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan excavated her pregnant Dennis Quaid as a Hebrew.
He smells - and he laughs back.
Later war in the ex-Ehepaar Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their graduation, the two Hollywood players are now playing a bad game with each other - in all public.
Meg Ryan had been in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle for the first time last week for the reasons for the scandals of the marriage: "This was a long time surprise for me, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has been experienced only after the graduation.
Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" is the story of a Hebrew.
Dennis Quaids' reaction to his outing as an unbelievably married man clearly appeared: "Unbelievably," said the 54-year-old "New York Daily News", that "May be the next time the story of our relationship has been repeated and re-examined."
It would also be "dedicative", that the 16-year-old son of Jack will again "reminiscent of the pain and the changes that mean a discharge for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the graduation, Quaid has been remarried and has recently been father of twinlingen.
And so it concluded with the page title: "My life goes on anyway.
I'm glad I have a wonderful family that's going best."
Cheap prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even higher than 50 per cent in the current study.
Flights and nights in hotels have become cheaper - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data since the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, has established a significant increase in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased over the years, the nights have already improved in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities were still at an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, the prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious was the trend in Paris and Rome, where travel 30 to 37 percent had to pay less than a year earlier.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to an "absorbed trip of American tourists".
Financial locations such as Frankfurt or London will also be stronger from the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices have increased by 26.3 percent even in Europe.
Also at the airport prices, the trend in the first quarter showed up:
As a result of the kerosin distribution, passengers in the economic class had to pay 7.1 per cent more than 2007 and long-term long-term flights were even to 29.2 per cent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for tickets from the economic class dropped by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in the business and first class were much lower.
In Germany, prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March the prices rose by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the prices have even doubled.
On the one hand, the price gap is the resulting economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the airline market broke.
On the other hand, there is an increased pressure on competition through the Open Skie Agreement, which liberalises air transport between the United States and Europe.
The signs of the challenging situation are the streaming of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were these 24 airlines.
HSV hits flatback 1:0
With a tower and simple method, the Hamburg SV table driver will be.
At the Borussia it is still not possible to find a functional elf.
Krisffer Little increases the exploitation of national players Marko Marin.
The gladbacher came into the game later and separated with a hero on the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went to him with confidence about the lips.
He probably knew he was right.
"We need the second tower," said Hermann Rieger at the start of the Hamburger Arena.
A lot wasn't out in the cataclysms, the half-time period was over, and most of them were on their places again.
Rieger was about three decades of HSV's physiotherapist, who enjoyed a higher view than a few flashy actors.
And that's how his prayers were found also in responsible positions.
Cornelius Jol, assistant trainer, refused and voted in favour of the ladies.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Chief Queen Martin Jol.
This command has been similarly heard: Lord with two gates!
The implementation was suspended.
"It wasn't nice to see everything today," said Marcell Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted to be more exciting.
1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers had to thank Mladen Petric's headball event (11); and the condition that very weak gladbachers could not beat the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a sweet victory," said Martin Jol together.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the visitors had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the Arena and the blitz tables on the video wall, which showed their unity as a class premium.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know that," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the tabular intermediate is more for the incalculability of the League than for the domination of his HSV.
The man with his later commitment - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torschütte Petric, and the Jansens, which were stolen from the FC Bayern, are still slow to shine, but they are not able to shine yet.
"We need more flair and more vibrations," demanded Joel.
After the vote,
The Wall Street is about the fear.
First messages from the rescue package were sent to the Dow Jones by 700 points.
That was the greatest loss in his history within a day.
Later, Dow found something else.
By 20:30, the world's largest beer barometer with good five percent in the minimum at 10.579 numbers.
The technologist Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in the minus at 1548 points.
The biggest losses were at this time in the Dow American Express, which amounted to almost 14 per cent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 per cent.
No title could be added.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs amounted to almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, Major Warren Buffett was involved in the company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called fake mortgage papers should be provided.
The sum should be paid, but not on a strike, but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should have a financial company’s share options that could be implemented in order to reduce the tax burden on the State.
Action courses in Europe and the United States in the Middle East
Banks in Europe and the United States do not address the doubts of the investors.
The share course of the German Grand Bank Hippo Real Estate runs out and reaches the Dax.
The US-index Dow Jones loses despite the planned saving of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular short-term losses of the Hippo Real Estate and the Commercial Bank have reduced the German share index (Dax) to a minimum.
Münchner's real estate finance has lost three quarters of its value despite the rescue action by the federal government and private banks, which the commercial bank has increased by more than 20 per cent.
The Dax was clearly released under the psychologically important 6000 points mark and noted with a minimum of 3.7 per cent at 5.839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets went into the bone.
In New York the Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the $700 billion heavy rescue package of the U.S. government could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back into circulation.
The Dow lost in the first trading hour 334 points or 3.3 percent at 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the settlement plan, which could follow the vote in the Senate on 1 October.
The other European sources could only be directed: the FTSE index in London initially accounted for 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743,61 figures.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng-Index broke by 2.1 per cent at 18.286.90 points.
In India, the Leindex Sensex 506,43 points or 3.9 percent lost and closed at 12.595.75 numbers.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor continued after a capital increase was announced.
The private bank Sal. Openheim has drawn 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism companies also announced that the shares of Thomas Cook were not sold.
Dark matter influence flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been in the hands of research for radar: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by-Mannover.
Experts feared that the general relativity theory Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
For almost 18 years, the space "Ulysses" has flowed through the globe.
Because of fast-sustained waste management, you now drink the hottest food.
Among scientists, there has been a mysterious phenomenon of confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie for years.
The Swing-by is a flightman of space probes, where they receive additional fainting in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, that is, the earth.
As a result, sin can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Council of Cassini Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What researchers have been surprised, however, for years: Flight bodies do not behave as 100 percent as expected under the age-old gravity law.
Much more is due to irregularities in speed.
The sins will be unexpected sooner or later.
Until then, the physicists could not explain this effect.
They killed him Swing-by-Anomalie.
Some experts feared that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einstein, which describes the power of matter through a circle of space, could not be quite right.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes that Einstein did not hurt, and tries to explain the Swing-by-Anomalie with the so-called dark matter that the astronomers in the universe have invented.
"Responsive to the anomaly could be dark matter which could also be in the vicinity of the earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter, the world researchers know only about ten years ago.
Clearly, it is a force of attraction that can be observed by other heavenly bodies.
It itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, the dark matter still makes a fifth of the entire mass of the universe good.
Tourists taken in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their commander, the tourists who fled to Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The leaders from the Sudan had demanded several million euros of money.
Six hostages should be killed in a shooting before release.
In southern Egypt five Germans have been removed.
Resolution negotiations should already be started.
The Germans continued to visit Kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists scattered in the Sahara are obviously free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV transmitter Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release following reports from Italian television transmitter Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other spirits have been released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians, and their eight Egyptian companions, were still and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition should already be on the way to Cairo.
The foundations of a shield still remain unclear before the release of the geese: However, the driver had been prepared by an Egyptian security officer to complete the removal before the Sudanese army had killed six of the pilots.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a solution," said the officer.
It would have been "only going to take the ghosts into acceptance", as suddenly "this surprise."
The Sudanese soldiers had shot six of them on Sunday in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The sellers had asked Germany for a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money should be transferred by the German wife of one of the sellers.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German mediateer, who was reluctant to release the geese because the children were afraid of their safety.
Following the report, the driver wants to release the female coins after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held as long as the driver had a safe flight.
The German message in Cairo drew an opinion on the report.
Misuse of Stifvat's "guilted to self-mortem"
The annual abuse by her stepfather has led to the fact that a woman has committed herself, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a prison sentence of six years after he had been sexually abused eight times.
The Court of Justice in Truro found that he was regularly arrested by his uncle Stephanie Randle as she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Ms. Randle was in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had fixed her eyes and connected her eyes before he had committed sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guest room.
Trerise and his wife were separated in the 1980s and he returned to Cornwall.
His uncle went to Plymouth.
However, the Court finds that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of her time honorably for the National Trust, was subjected to abuse, which she was added twice a week.
State lawyer Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who had been an excellent surfer and driver, had been "emotional toe" since 2006 and had "give up her life"
In April 2007, she found Father Terrance Randle in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she moved around by touching herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of condolence, who concluded: "I tried to bind them and bind their eyes."
"I haven't had sex with her.
I feel responsible for their death."
Justice Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely friendly fetishist and must have been excellent for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended before the court if she had not done so."
He added: "I take into account the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, her actions over the years on her daughter.
They would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The officials responsible for the loss of data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet staff who had lost very much trust in a train in June will be accused of "public security law".
The man was appointed by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were submitted to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no reference to criminal purposes.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They had thought that this would be an internal change in the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause that covers the safe storage of information.
The Royal Government recommends that the officers be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of their work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he submitted included classified assessments on Al-Quaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eyes
British housing companies could cost more than 80 million dollars in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion funds to protect Bradford & Bingleys' facilities 2.6 million customers.
The benefits for this loan are paid by all companies receiving the money of employees, including 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Building Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it would be "unresponsible" that companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid if Bradford & Bingleys credits have been added.
However, the interest paid in the medium term is calculated each year by the 700 financial companies that accept the payments.
The programme for compensation for financial services confirmed against the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is a pity that those institutions that have acted carefully ... are now called upon to take some of the costs of those institutions which were much less transparent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay for the investments it would hold, and that the companies had to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on credit will be paid to 450 million dollars in 2009.
This means that companies have to make 81 million dollars for the first year's benefits.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Buildings, told BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is a pity that those institutions that have kept their eyes focused on the real estate will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions which were far less transparent.
According to the BSA, no society has been broken since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest paid in 2009 covers the seven months of the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010 interest rates will fall down for a full year and this could be almost double.
Since construction companies are two-sided non-corporate organisations, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings.
Milk will be five pounds per liter dearer
The people in Jersey are facing this challenge to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that the market price of his milk will be reduced by five pounds per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after an advisory company's studies have been conducted.
The individual distributors should decide whether they want to continue the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the large market price of Jersey Milch was changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is being charged
A court in Bangladesh referred to a case investigation by former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her advocates said that the court refused to charge 50 million taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several Swiss charges for corruption against them.
Scheich Hasinas of the long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Union, asked that the Transitional Transitional Government should first grant her unlimited freedom.
The respondents say that although her husband was granted a residence permit to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of her release whether she can continue on free foot if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers indicated that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The Supreme Court has referred the case to Schech Hasina's appeal, because it says that she does not have to receive a bail, since she is already in custody abroad in order to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Hq said.
We're going to report a complaint against the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers pointed out that they needed bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Scheich Hasina will be back home after October 17th, said an Awami-Bundnis-Party president on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military-supported Transitional Government took over the power, but she was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Scheich Hasina and Khaleda Zia, all the charges against each other are false.
Commitments to the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the most recent anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children are not affected by the violence associated with the Taliban, so the United Nations is not involved.
The United Nations has carried out an Immunization programme in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN speaker, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise that thousands of workers would not be arrested or prevented.
BskyB lost complaint in case ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competitive sending of ITV.
BskyB has decided to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyBs had closed the competition and allowed it to have an unfavourable impact on the ITV senders.
BskyB acquired his share in 2006 by calling NTL, now in Virginia Media, successfully prevented the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB was due to doubts about the independence of the ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Agency of Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued to reduce the pressure of its share of ITV, whether it was an unreasonable and excessive measure, particularly because BskyB had announced that it would want to issue its voting rights.
New U.S. U.S. State Warfare
The U.S. Secretary-General has commissioned a special agent to deal with the closure of the nine U.S. nationals in 2006.
The hearing was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, where the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, lawyers and former state attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by the fears that the prosecutors had been dismissed for political reasons.
The Special Mediar Nora Dannehy should now clarify whether the officials who were involved in the investigation had joined the investigators in order to prevent justice.
In his report, General Inspector Glenn Fine said that the most serious crimes, including criminal proceedings, have not been fully investigated or clarified.
The appointment of a specialist with the authority to force witnesses to speak was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 nine U.S. state attorneys from their employers.
At this point, the Ministry of State argued that the public prosecutors would be released because of poor labour services.
However, it was later found that the dismissed state ministers were not judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the obstacles as politically motivated.
Some of these state officials were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress while others refused to investigate the claims of democratic elections.
US U.S. government officials are commissioned to investigate and prosecute cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, has been sentenced to a decision and has finally brought down his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
In particular, the General Inspector General's report spoke critically about the role of Gonzales by introducing the "main responsibility" for the discharges, "delegated" its leadership role and "excellently interested" in the process.
Other officials, including President Bush Karl Rove's former Chief Adviser, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Episcopal songs to be played with
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is supposed to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for its Ethiopian Hymne "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will take his special golden price in London the next week during the lecture, said he was ashamed to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title piece to Meat Loafs Hitler from 1977.
"Coldplay" introduces the nominations for the award this year after it has arrived in four categories in the lower selection.
The chief editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that go through such materials as time and genres and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrument part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979 in the sale and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and has sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been under the most serious health problems in recent years. One of these was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heart beats after he was on the stage.
In 2007, he had to give his concerts due to an acute headache.
Later it was known that he had a silence on his voiceband.
Obscene streets in town, often forgotten and soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of main traffic routes, singles, side roads and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
However, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals to tell where Extra Place is located, simply because most of them have never heard of it.
This windy street is located in the East Village and runs from the first Street to the North between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a steamy gas than an active traffic route used.
There are no street paintings either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on the first street.
It wants Extra Place to create a clean road to the towns and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
The other suspects belong to the long-term neighborhood, which says they are fascinated by the short gas, simply because they are one of the survivors of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Community Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have made a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the Committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the coming month, as is the case with Susan Stetzer, the district officials in Council 3.
"Only a very small space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to remain in the city," she said.
"It could offer how to repair and operate the road, what Avalon might do, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small streets were refurbished and satisfactorily designed for a coffee that the company wanted to avoid.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it did not want to own it unconditionally.
"The main features of the Avalon Bay are to renovate this fallen gas and make it a public meeting," she added, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the building protection department, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his beautiful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has preserved some of its historical impressions.
Some believe that the street has received its name in 1802, as a large farm that was part of Philip Minthorne, divided among his many children and claimed a narrow country by no one.
The center of the CBGB Music Club, the Punk Rocket to Russia, which was closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is known for its photo cover on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of cracks, lamps and parts of fascists, posters, leaves and seals.
Some residents, including the blogger who wrote about the genocide of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public piece, as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have accepted Extra Place as a rarety – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be allowed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's missing New York" (subscribed with "The Book of Complaints: A Better Nostalgic View of the Dead City"), published a part of the city's story about Extra Place, which appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small pocket gas that is even dark and is marked by broken metal roofs of storage halls, closed windows, and on riverbanks during flight of weekly newspapers."
With few exceptions, the road was just as short as a night.
One rat loved the back part of the street, not far from the door that led to the CBGB, where today there is a expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the ground not far from a fresh band of printed newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but they thought that the road could be pushed up something.
Fields, he added, in his view, some people underestimate the travel of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the dark, cold, and bitter places.
Discussion on bilingual education: education in English-language environment
In this issue of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for secondary education.
Lance T. Isumi, head of scientific staff in California Studies and Director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a founder of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a choice".
The Spanish electoral challenge is a complex task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example.
Obama's campaign of election states that "the probability of successful completion of the school in Afro-American and Hispanic students is lower than in white students" - which he agrees.
In order to close this performance gap, Obama’s education plan recommends, among others, a two-language transition phase in training for those who learn English only.
However, the question is whether Obama's use of bilingual education, which focuses on education in other languages as an English language, reflects his interest in reducing the distance in the schools.
We take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a basic school in the eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Spanish and come from families with low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, 100 percent of the fourth grade students had the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
It was also surprising that 93 percent of the children in the fourth year of school were evaluated as well in English.
This remarkable success was achieved by other methods, such as those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on verification and practice, constant control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach followed by the training in an English-language environment. That is exactly the point that Obama should observe, so schoolmate Linda Mikels.
This approach puts value on the almost exclusive use of English in vocational training.
Mrs. Mikkels, who rejected the idea of bilingual training, told me that the school would have had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would be able to attend the classroom and not be able to meet him again.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The services of the school would facilitate the response to this issue, but the political positions within its own party (the national education associations have already supported the idea of bilingual training) and its subsequent support for bilingual training make it uncertain about Obama's response.
While acknowledging the point that immigrants should learn English, he soon tried to triviate the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "only English" purpose of law enforcement.
Instead, he said, "They should make sure that your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should take into account carefully the training models that work, instead of focusing on them and triviating them.
The oil price is therefore the most recent in terms of the economy
The agricultural price is on Monday because of the fears that even the American recovery plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to relive the economy.
The oil stores at New York's trade fairs fell by 7 per cent at the morning session at $99.80 per Barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has been down by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been hit both by the financial disturbances on the Wall Street and by powerful windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak in July of $145.29 per Barrel, they fell to almost $90 per Barrel this month to rise again as a result of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have again expressed concern, although Congress representatives have announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan, which should be the biggest in history.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis had not yet ended.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, a government statement should be made on Monday that the Citi group purchases the banks of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial companies Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the ongoing negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to make the vote on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts of the German Bank have written to investors in a communication that has become extremely unknown to the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the welfare markets, we are mostly concerned about whether the US-American virus spreads around the world, especially in China."
The Bank's analysts corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the coming year and reduced their forecast for oil and gas prices by 20% in 2009.
Humanity record by series in the second quarter
In the defense of Shaun Ellis, he thought he had seen everything after he had spent more than everyone else in the Jets trip in the last half of the years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned an unproductive game into a triumphal procession.
"I haven't seen anything like this yet," said Ellis.
After a slamming game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which spoke of the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when the quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Cole for a 12-yard Touchdown, it marked the perfect reception one afternoon at their developing cooperation.
Favre found Cole in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once appeared as an outlaw, and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I didn't particularly insist," says Cole about the steps that went to Cole.
"He's a super-player.
Our vote has been voted, although the people were thinking."
While Favre and Cole caught caught, the defense of the quarterback Kurt Warner took place.
Externally protected Darrelle Revis found a broken hole and turned it into a 32-year-old tuchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and found him.
Linebacker David Bowens then took care of a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, broken by Bowens, was probably the most crazy one.
The Cardinals had taken the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets returned the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-year shot into 34 to 0 leadership.
That was most of the points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the journey, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On both of the answers, because the jets allowed to achieve in the third quarter 21 points without a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A number of points have been achieved in a short time."
Absorbing braiding glass is a world record
Haile's breast-feeding class from Ethiopia has shown again why he has been held for the best long run of all time since he broke his own record in Berlin, Marathon on Sunday, and became the first person to get the track of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebsselsie has improved its previous score from 2:04:26 to 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Bracelassie, 35, has set up his 26th world record in his numerous career, in which he has achieved at least one world record per mile from a kilometer to the Marathon.
In the last month, bronchitis has left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing that the air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he joined in the war in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - the braking rate has been achieved with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Bresselasie and Paul Tergat have moved from Kenya to long distances, the record time for Marathon has fallen in the last 10 years for more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa has won from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, he was told that he had two weeks before he was in his bed and could not train for a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back in a hurry.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All is perfect running.
I took the training back a week ago and had some more thoughts today, but at the end of everything was great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Rivalen from East Africa - that he orchestrated his careers excessively, that many of the world's best Marathonstars are generally afraid of losing too much on the runners as if it were a train race, and that he makes a world record of the fight.
But this criticism does not harm the size of the bridge as long-distance runners.
Along with four Kenyans on Sunday, the middle of the street was reached at 1:02:04.
Two helicopters from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to demand a broncho class after the timers left.
A little more than three miles before the finish has made his last attempt to get away from Kambai, which came second at 2:05:36 and thus has improved his best time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became the third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germany, has completed a significant year by showing with 2:19:19 the most rapid result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Britain.
Last morning, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She has adapted the games in Beijing due to problems described as a return damage. However, she has managed to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third Marathon for five minutes.
She planned her trip by leaving a quarter of the Ethiopian and Kenyan runners for the first time, but after 30 kilometers.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third in 2:25:01.
The pillar and strapas in the lives of the black people, in a city of very special kind
Hidden between the exchanges of the holiday parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, laurels and giant trains, is a quiet city in which the pillar and the complications of African American culture come to the fore.
Eatonville, the first typically black city in the country and the home city of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as simple as Horston did in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three croquets, 300 brown homes, 300 good swimming rooms, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pickup station.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to think of the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city which it describes – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide produced at the time of the depression of the federal writer project – in many respects is a place of the very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, busy and private as in the 1930s when Horston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what happens to him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a citizen of the city and a member of the oldest church in the city.
It must be heard."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of the triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of about 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate doubles as high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is a highlight of literature and on the other, an example of - sometimes condemned, sometimes prized - - the black culture of the rural south, whose roots are in the American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and they are on the hill.
And just as accurate as the thoughts about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all Horston here calls it.
She introduced the world to her home city in books that were written by hearts, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Your Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is close to route 77, leading a road through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the creation of black history and human drama.
Frequent and Oskar, both in real life and in literature, Hurston's reader led to the load of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then became more private affairs.
"Out of the street to the left," she wrote, "the brown school is located - well-known modern school, with its placed gardens and playgrounds, to care for Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man from Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Sales of any kind and what-what-always fits into hours' rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus brought Eatonville with self-restriction, but also with analfabetism, second marriage and sex.
I'm sure that wasn't a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was valued by all.
"Then she described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters denied the Horston by inviting the men to sing songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual performances.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
It still reminds us of Hurtson as a living excentriqueur who returned regularly after his family was taken to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Horston was used in the city, she did this most without warning, smoking and wearing a learnt Chevrolet, and wearing hair in a city, the same thing today is painted in her honorable style of dress.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, though many respected them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while looking in his chair, on a terrace on the back, looking at the Sabelia Sea, in which the Horston of all probability was baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and broke her books.
Along with the majority of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was the first famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was placed in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big memorial, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography published by Hurston in 2003.
The winds came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to set up a five-pound highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-six main streets of the community.
Orlando's predecessors had already pressed the road 4 through the western city street.
The proposal was extended when Eatonville was still in a difficult phase in his history.
Force integration, among others, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racism brought Hasss into the community.
"At this time a bunch of white boys came and they stole oranges and witnesses to the outside people," said Mr. Franklin.
"It even killed a woman.
They stole a watermelons from the car."
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, called for the Supreme Court's request for integration by calling it a decision against the Schulrat in the case of Brown as "an act of respect for my race".
People today say that while the lifting of racism was positive in some respects, it made it difficult for them to hold the group together in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of their youth.
"Black children were used to be upset - I remember it - they were upset by their teachers in the morning and they woke up their teachers in the evening," said N. Y. N. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the director of the business director of the joint group for the protection of the Eatonville Community.
This could be obtained as long as it could be received, she added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"Man didn't upset his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural cult," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of a place for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have moved forward, as they did, with a positive sense of self-consciousness and say: "We can never deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, author Alice Walker went on the road to Hurston's unnamed grave and began fighting for the restoration of her space.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's many famous Horston biography was found in the books' rules, and he again became part of the American literary canon.
The street project came to an exact moment when the most famous daughter in Eatonville once again stood in the light of the public.
And this time, Herston's old neighbor saw her as a retina.
In 1988 the community began planning a Hurston Festival to show what could destroy the area with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening ceremony two years later, and every January many return for the festival.
A few years later, the area moved from its roadmaps.
"The plans of a five-square street lived in the city, speeded up the whole city with high speed, grew a real civil pillar," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd made it easier to say, "Now Eatonville saved."
The victory against the street project has contributed to a change in the city's own image.
There were more and more refugees, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and indigenous people began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the country-wide historical record in 1998.
A new unique library (of course called Horston) opened in 2006 on the newly created and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still as special in Florida: only 6 miles from the city center Orlandos can sometimes feel like a summer gas, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is now up to 90% black.)
The search for Eatonville's history and its significance are often treated with caution.
For most interviews, a prior authorisation is necessary and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and represented black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a love for dark rock, still feared that their disillusioned community would be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Horston Festival, there was also a higher degree of homelessness.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Horston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, nor more proud, creative and flexible, aberration and amusing like any other race and nation group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is going to return to Eatonville to work in the city administration or in the police, who said he could use some help.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old volunteers from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who pass just here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon again one Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here we are in New York, and we are talking about a flying finanzlatin.
At first, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan fled from the newspaper and the violent TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the Swiss offices with the glass façade, bankiers and hedgefund administrators who have the monopoly in New York, they have the worst Horror's day since the 1929 Börsenssendstudent.
The suppliers still drive the metal wires along the city walls and transport tablets that are loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still spends between apartments about how human packs are loaded with about 50 T-shirts that hang on a joch-like stick lying on their shoulders.
Officials are still waiting for food items on the citizens' stones on their breakfast bags and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekend between 16 and 19 hours.
It didn't feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon because of all the world's way forward.
Although I decided to lay my duty on the quiet afternoon afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase Family File, about 20 people were already there.
Not to pay the money to pay or pay the money, but to the customer service switch where customers order delivery books, to ask tourists on the way to Macy's house and where to open new customers' accounts.
Most in front of me, as I later learned from Starr, my "personal bankers with license" were on the same ground as I was laughing.
In contrast to me, however, they had already raised their savings from smaller banks, to places where they had fallen from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the state of Iceland.
They had raised money from so-called truffles (a little like a construction case), socio-economic banks and those local spruces that only have in a State branch and say they treat their customers as family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks were stable and free of charge.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities up to $327 billion, in competition management over and on the last Friday New Yorker went home, was Wachovia, another bank with savings in the value of $440 billion, looking for a profitable buyer.
In the morning before another intrusion, the office and loading agents who stopped their bars in front of me took a bank that was considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most of the purchases of the Wall Street.
All normal New Yorkers have adapted in the last few weeks to flying finanzlatin.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket took so much confidence about Lehman Brothers, the bank that had passed away and their distinguished president, Dick Full, as she would learn about a false colleague.
And Lynn, who has been in the 50-year uniformed Concierge of my home block, has come from our usual maintenance topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslim graffiti happened during a legal dispute in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-hand judge of the Austrian Free Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right Partei Vlaams, took part on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the "Citys Against Islam" organization.
They carry pictures in the style of traffic signs on a mask, lined with a red line.
The police accuse the law-enforcement officers of a Muslim peace court in Austria, on the same weekend at the party's extreme right to record significant gains in the country's parliamentary elections.
In the evening of Friday morning, more than 90 graves were badly damaged at the Peace Hall in Traun by Linz in an action organized by a police officer.
The perpetrators questioned Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials held this for a attempt to break the motive of the extremists sent by the Hass to Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way connected with the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said she was "stupidly shocked" about the news of the massacre, which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan to the end.
At the same time, there is a round of research of knowledge in Austria after the country in the current parliamentary elections was moved to the right.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received almost 30% of the votes, joined in their election struggle for a strict anti-invasive law and some of their electoral statements were criticized by enemies as alien.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, joined a ban on headaches and Burkas and even made his refusal to food that is generally linked to Islam.
At his last appointment in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of Moscow and Minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuing Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
Questionnaires and analyses conducted immediately after the election, stating that the extreme rights of the country's strongest political block are indicated that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel barriers for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who has been sentenced to sexual abuse of children, was rightly denied to travel to France and Spain.
Glitter presented a six-month spree after informing the control authorities about it that he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent were given the last Thursday to stop a travel ban after they presented evidence to the judges of Gliter's punishment for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing of the Ashford Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning, the Court of Justice.
In a report from the Court of Justice, "On Thursday, 25 September, the Police of Kent at the Ashford Court requested permission to ban foreign travel from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the register for sexual offences, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also had to inform the police seven days before his planned departure.
The notification of the authorities could lead to a 5-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or possible shelters in the country.
A spokesman from Kents Police Unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is that it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the most urgent duty of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent, and we work closely together to monitor the conduct of registered sexual offenders in the country, to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glotter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew Glimmer to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel good and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport check and he flew into one and went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and border officials insisted that he returned to Britain.
On August 22st, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the court of Uxbridge in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request him to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was arrested in 1999 for 4 months in the United Kingdom because of possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was satisfied and satisfied that Glitter was stopped to travel to France and Spain.
'I received the master behind the stage to confirm his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no smiles, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the large flamencotens who fail to concentrate and focus on the interpretation to gain a relaxing appearance as a woman or as a man.
One-sided Artists
On the other hand, personality
I look in private life, at these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I find the typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen glance or the strength of the hands that are concerned because they are not being involved.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of thematics on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame codification at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of the photograph of Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing daily, turns around, and makes it clear to the artist that `Flamenco-people' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, then the observer notes that there are no typical images of artists on the stage.
All normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to express patience, sadness, joy, and thus move the audience.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on the stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would enable me to maintain the character of the largest flame comemer with the camera.'
Farmer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera in 1997.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, pictures were created that remind us of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, thereby allowing the image to understand modernity and the idea of how the producer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
This is not only the dance, song or instrumental game, but the personality of the artist, his character, who performs the public with his art.
The search for the essential, after a certain thing, which will be visible in the form of the ear, His will, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotomata next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others who were photographed by almost seven artists.
The project has become an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portrait led him to reach this idea again two years ago and to act as a 'portrait of the veterans of the sport' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer likes me very much to photograph, to know people and to place me in their living conditions, whether for a brief moment or for a long time.
I think the portrait in the area of photography is the hardest thing to do.
You meet or attack people, personalities you don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to make a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.'
The collection of the port of Flamencos from today with the title `Flamenco-people' is held in the gallery of El Fotomata, which is located on the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited by 16 October.
Vargas Llosa argues that the Rome he just writes is 'a tonicity'.
He doesn't know where the Roman operation takes place and why it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to get ahead of the project he is working on, a novel with protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and went to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate said that the project he is working with is 'a toll' and 'all points out that he should not write the novel'.
“If I had been there, I wouldn’t have done it, but I’d do it and hope to end the Roman," so he ended his participation at the festival where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La Ciudad y los perros' was one of the greatest characters at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival Award and who gave the majority of the audience their voices, is compared with the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and noted that he had a publication before him, which noted that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to be able to do everything again: as his profession was created for literature, from the 'extraordinary adventure', from 'freedom of reading' and from 'more than ever before'; as he wrote and `Disciplin is true' to achieve his intense work with documentation, many corrections and revisions he made; such as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas, his study of literature, and his experience of 'exual adventures', which are the most influential and effective of the reason.
The Spanish Roman writer suggested that there is 'no way', where to measure and where to know whether books change lives, 'but I do not believe that literature is pure entertainment, a flying experience', said Vargas Llosa, who claims to bring 'effects over' and 'the people are still more familiar', so I asked the writer 'search the ease' and 'responsibility' for his profession'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: powerful fighting parties fell out partially.
After the announcers found that the ground of the place was in bad shape, the fortress that had to be closed in Pozoblanco was abandoned in the morning.
The organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to transfer the sterilization party.
Thus the fortress of the inconsistencies was established, so two of the three parties could not be found.
On Saturday it calculated that because the second stage of the campaign could not be celebrated.
The Matador group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días, and Juan Bautista, who cared for the strength struggle.
That's just a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and trimphied, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and esthetics.
On the same night, Alejandro Talavanante met two ears and an ear of the stier, which he had gained more through Galoppieing than through his battle art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without noise.
After he had done so badly, a large part of the audience reacted to his second battle with buh-rufen.
In Álava two people wanted to take control of their car, which was loaded with 2,000 Kilo Haschisch.
Morning: five minutes ago.
Transport checks in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álva).
Two police officers called on the driver of the car to make an appointment, while they caught the flight.
It seemed like they didn't have to stop with the loading of more than two thousand Kilo Haschisch.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, who was 28 years old, known as A.A. J., as it told the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The person arrested was charged with drug trafficking and the arrest of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the Álva region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and crossed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to hold a car to carry out routine checks. The driver did not follow the instructions, gradually increased the speed and attempted to take control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped a few kilometers off the coast. At the moment, the driver got out of the car to fly across a rural area.
Finally, the police of the city of Ertzaintza held one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers carried 2,178 Kilo Haschisch, who was attacked by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschischbunks, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and to the removal of the belt to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the sign was ‘double’ so that it did not agree with the sign mentioned in the Kfz papers, and therefore an additional decision was made because of falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue to investigate the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, was able to fly, but also to determine the origin of the alleged drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A.J. was taken to a police station and is presented to the Court of Justice in the coming hours.
Player Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actor Heather Locklear, known as Amanda's role in the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a reporter from the California transport police told the magazine `People'.
The witness told details that Locklear `after 16:30 hours of gaspedal pressed and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the parking lot, and when she went back, she picked up some times on her sunglasses'.
Some time later, the witness, who at first didn't recognize the player, probably didn't realize that Locklear had stopped on a nearby street and got the car up.
The witness was that person who informed the service, because they had 'lived a lot of Locklers'.
When the police officers arrived, they found the players sitting in their car, which was standing on the street, blocking the traffic.
'They seemed to be out of direction', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol centre to test.
According to a police speaker, the actor showed cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first time. "The first comments of the officials were followed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug," said the speaker.
Locklear was suspected of driving under the influence of an unknown substance which could not be determined, was arrested and brought to a local investigation court at 19 hours.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from the clinic in Arizona, where she was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares is that the Andalusian link of the United Nations links will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamzares, the chief coordinator of the VL and the United Nations team, has today ensured that the regional association for education will be those who will meet the decision in the case of the former town of the Council for Youth and Sport in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was back last week after he was charged with making business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a large federist, and the Andalusian organization will be those who must assume responsibility for it,' Llamzares pointed out how the party has to deal with it, which has so far been a city hall in Seville.
Despite this, the VL president explained the need for 'transparency' in the possible examinations of the regulations that Silva might have started: 'The VL always meant that such cases would receive maximum transparency'.
In view of this issue, he stressed that the education has `a stricter ethical code for all public officials'.
`Sangre de Mayo': Heldenbuch von Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nationales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de Mayo' is the revised version of Spain's famous stand against the French. This is a remarkable film in the film, with around 15 million euros investment for the work of the industry.
In this way, the Chinese tried to 'show a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired at the works of the famous Roman writer, today Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Kim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of artists.
“Sangre de Mayo” with a film for more than two and a half hours, this holiday will be presented in Kinos and will later be shown on the Telemadrid sender as a four-year-old ministry.
José Luis Garci, the great fan of the literature of Galdós, ensures that thanks to this drawing work, his `children' stream' went into effect. This has led him to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to film a film on the second century festival in Madrid on 2 November. In particular, the history based on the basis of 'Episodios Nationales' took place.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous community of Madrid for drilling, offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-time chance' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of 'refused Spain, which sought the wrong leader for the fight, because the people were brought back by the struggle for independence and under the reign of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Chinese suspects that with funding such as 'Alatrist' or 'Los Fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as 'Sangre de Mayo'), some scenes from the draw book with Horacio Valcárcel, who worked with the Garci almost all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual way of working: he put himself on the stage with the players who had to start running before and for those who had not done castting, seemed to be 'demonic' and respected, "a part of the director's profession is involved in helping the theater and the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you are working."
Many of the suspects he shoots in `Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar-Candidat in four nominations (who won one), is the opinion and is sure that none of the three candidates present in Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de Mayo', nor 'Siete meas de billar francês', nor is it the chosen film `Los garisole ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any discounts for this film.
“At first you believe that you are working for the future, later you notice that it is only for the poets, and now you are satisfied when you have produced another film,” explains Garci after more than 30 years of employment.
Isabel Bayón calls the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Törtola Valencia back
A flame-container from Seville honours a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Törtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Törtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andaluserin (Georina Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in the fourth Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in Oriental dances.
She had a exciting life, she was one of the first combatants for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and set herself up for the removal of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the period between the wars, was fascinated by Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
"We're not trying to tell her life, but to keep her breath," said the flamencontainer.
Your dance floor has helped me in Flamenco a lot.
"The dance of the Schmetterling" came to me, for example, like Guajira, or "the dance of the slange" like tango.
Her dancing was meaningful and I was told that my dancing was also in this aesthetic area, she claims.
The emphasis is on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who is still singing for Isabel in one of her ideas, as he has done in 'La Puerta abierta'; and with Flemenco Master Matilda Coral, who wanted to work exclusively with one of her former students.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very rich personality.
I'm happy because they agreed to work with me, and I feel very ashamed of myself.'
The emphasis is also calculated with musical composition and the guitarist Jesús Torres and Paco Ariaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with actor Juanfra Juárez, he takes over the role of the artist who was the Divas, in whom he has always loved.
In this work it is also reported in a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in places such as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular age and whose works today are no longer respected and therefore less respected,” Bayón claims.
The exhibition is held today at 20:30 in the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916 married Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities in the order of the Andalusian Council for Culture in order to celebrate the 'Trinium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fifth anniversary of the release of the literary price and the death date of both.
This will end with the new edition of this work, with the international convention held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the tour exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz', opened in May and, after it was in different places in Andalusia, New York will now be presented at the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', as illustrated by Pedro Taberero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian poet known.
The US can pretend without Paul Newman.
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of those.'
This set comes from the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the prevailing U.S. Chinese presentation that was released on the scene, from all America to Newman with his favorite presentation and followed her.
Now look at what it cost him to give Oscar.
And when he came back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a great blow for everyone.
"What a person sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a big friend," said Robert Redford sadly, "my life and my country were the greatest troubles of his life."
No one was afraid of making yourself ridiculous or being overextended.
As the 'Father' of the Chinese and the Fatherland, he died in a tragic moment, overcomes fear of terrorists and the market collapse, in which the downset of US Americans' self-restraint on the hopeless search for reasons to maintain dignity.
If only a few people who can be amazed remain in this hard time without tears, you must not be unimpressed Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and experienced as different losses as well as gains: from the Foundation that has written the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage who died at the overdose, he was founded on his own brand of domestic and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it costs him a lot of pleasure to spend on a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of surprise is about Hollywood without any reference to nationality and state membership.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died but the whole era.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar priest said that the work with Newman was no more or less than the tops of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, calls Newman his greatest inspiration.
'And we have left the greatest of all of us,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who have tried to live as Paul Newman lived today: to meet high requirements in the rule of law, to have a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media gang.
But there's someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example.
He was once divorced and then married to Joanne Woodward for five years, who was faithful, although there were certainly many opportunities for it to be.
"Where should I eat a hamburger on the street if I have a file at home?" he often complained himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
"Of all the great roles that he played, he was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive Opas and the philanthropist," they say.
The streets in Madrid are missing for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the 2012 schedule, but it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it doesn't agree!
She was called the perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything and everything that she had.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to observe the evaluation and I could check it, it wouldn't have been so clear.
But, let's go from the beginning to everything.
The nose starts with the ticket, which allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, then they should give you everything (including chips to avoid the noise on the street).
I don't think so.
Here they will only get you the ticket (the first one that exists only to go there) and (after an infinite waiting language) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second coin because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it so that after the crisis, only a small, much cheaper heaven was chosen to buy less stuff?
So good, things like these are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Except that you have to hang up very early to pick up the chip, there is already a waiting period of at least 15 minutes and also you have to leave the racksack.
The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, which in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected is incomprehensible.
Finally, as it was expected, the streets were closed, and we had not allowed our returns to lie before, even if it had once been achieved, but it would have been more difficult to keep them back.
It also saw that in these 40 minutes waiting for rain, so it came to the attempt to organize a crowding distance and to cross the houses.
I believe that tomorrow some 500 people will have long-distance and some like me because of this chip I've got, don't even appear right at the classification, I can already think that the exit has been wrong.
Of course, if you were to ask me for a perfect road, I would never like that road.
So I think we'll still dream of a city that's well prepared for the Olympic games
Microsoft on the search for a (virtual) recipeist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an essence of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but it is possible to perform some primary tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft it is a road planner to move on the company's campus). The system takes note of what it hears during maintenance.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, these 'receptionists' can recognize how many people are in the room who they are and even remember how they were dressed, can listen to it and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It can also organize the participants after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that talks with her, and that he is not a company agent.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will be heard soon.
All without the blue screenshot
End-printing
I'm sure that's the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, we talked very briefly about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and have not had so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer determined that if the computer was equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial furniture, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will be only for the few.
Everything is only a fix when you think that Microsoft in Windows versions added one or more functions and 'Extras'.
The change in direction is due
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system in general, just like the software.
When Google chrom appeared on the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many showed that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an invisible part, will always be necessary to enable hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to communicating something with his or her mother.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to execute the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and we spend more time on surfing than in the environment of the 'window'.
For which half of the existing applications are available on the computer?
Less is less than
And Windows 7 has to be compact, very compact as Vista.
Lighter, don't exceed, less complicated.
The interest of Microsoft is more involved in integrating its online services, which can then ultimately become the alternatives to Google.
In fact, they need that, no doubt, I'll give you a little example of that.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the Refreshing Drink Automation Automation is a painting: 'Your Search. Our Future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google for online research.
On the other hand, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear in the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time on the market.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso has purchased it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had these brands in `Blue Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well built pharmacies.
When we begin to count the countless stars, we can return to the image of a very powerful man, with a thick bar that had raised heavy weight in a wanderer circle.
Based on this, it is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, stainless and talented.
The English languages call it 'tank'. However, Fabulaux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
Firstly, because of his great name, although it is called in the narrow circle 'Marcel'. The legend tells us that the title stamp is connected to sports and is derived from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' surprises all because of his excellent tree wool, because of his different unisex cuts, and is characterized by a small Belgian fence (although not identifiable) that has these T-shirts as detail in the middle.
And the Belgian company is not focusing solely on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, Woods of Woodwood, T-shirts with strings, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although it's very bad to use them as clothes.
You're very upset.
I want to be a young mother; I don't care about the candidate.
Her great attitude toward her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is rare, but full of joy of life.
At the present time, the weak-hearted Groz takes their new activity very seriously in the fashion.
For Monica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their calls.
She was in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, leaving her residence and also making the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that sponsored the Spanish fashion house.
Be merciful and compassionate, winewinners on the short tracks.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this Herbst/Winter Season, which my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango, and I have also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to Valentinos honor.
A very intense working time, which is equally exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I am fascinated by the Chinese of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I'm going through a city and watching women, how they're dressed, how they combine their clothes, which I do often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very diverse woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything in one and this area has many communities.
Ever since I was a child, I was excited about clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to get back to my aunt's clothes and see her dress.
That was great to go to a holiday park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to focus on the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in teaching and at the trials to look at our mirror and feel good about it.
As an actor, when you get the costume, you're moving into the real player role.
Finally, everything will be linked together, it is so much respect for the designer and their professionality.
You've become 30 recently, you're not in a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than you, I feel better than 30 years.
I find that the woman is getting rich, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was little, and it has given me much more joy.
So, do you think you're gonna be a mother, or don't you?
I've known for a long time that I'll be a mother because my body needs it and also I want to be a young mother; I don't want to let it go.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
I'm going to tell my child a great feeling of happiness and get it out of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the work you have participated in and have been driven in the last year.
That is exactly what I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, are very impatient and impatient and want to have everything at once, which can't be immediately.
I very much wish that 'La ultima hora' and 'En bussca de la tumba de Christ' should be introduced for the first time.
See how they like you.
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, say something like that.
It's not like I went on the path to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a while, has just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the well-being of her organization 'Fraine for a better world' and the dress we show. I know that two clothing items from our collection for Mango have been extended to collect the money for Namos NGO.
People don't know the name of a good heart.
I, as those who know them, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing, where it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this wonderful thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a hand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, what is needed.
The car drivers that can be revolving because of the alcohol supply will need to install the 'alcolock'.
The Authority finds that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol abuse, installs in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunk condition. If he is alcoholic, then the car will not break down.
The initiative has already been announced in June in the last month and is now part of the report of the General Public Administrative Board. According to its information, it is a pilot project that will last a year.
The purpose is to reciprocate the driver, which is why this is a course for the conversion of the traffic behaviour.
In addition to the general government, the Ministry of Transport and the establishment of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Vehicles will participate, according to experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of car drivers who were shown more than once because of alcohol-induced driving were again taxed.
The 'alcolock' would prevent it because it's a system connected to the car, it loses the alcohol content in the air outlet and prevents the autostart if the driver has made an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is established which is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1000, the costs will be borne by those who commit the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices have already stopped up to 65 % of the regulatory damage after their introduction in the first year.
In Spain it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take this action before it has been punished.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be carried out on a regular basis and, however, a reform of the principle that is necessary for the prosecution process is required.
The device is still on the Spanish markets, not available in any business, although it has already been built in some of the public transport vehicles and vehicles.
In the morning, the House of Lords will be voted in favour of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which proposes to install this system in schools. This has been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, the time provided for by the program, along with the presidial flag of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, the Spanish aircraft, accompanied by Asturian's firstborn and firstborn.
The sun went down, but their arrows were still forced to use their hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that rose from the plane.
Direct to the Gangway: Spanish Ambassadors and Other Authorities
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the mayor and the mayor of Asturia visited the city to formalize the official trip.
- Oh, very good, so you can't take people from here at the airport this time.
No, she's the Spanish, but she's been here for a few years.
- Oh, yeah, very good.
But the Mexican press know exactly who the ancestors and the ancestors of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport’s hangar and in the red carpet, including the military protection of 27 marine soldiers who gave the honor.
The bear appears mildly dressed, dressed in sea blue, and she, the bear, with long wind-mixed hair, with no ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that a sweater is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they relax and are prepared for the photographers in which the official follow-up is expected.
At the hotel door, in which they are presented, one of the four largest in the city, waits for a reporter from the Mexican TV that makes fun of them.
The best option in the mode
There was probably no suitable place in the world as Paris to present a prize of fashion and there was probably no significant fashion designer and bonus designers as Valentino.
Mango presents the second issue of the fashion competition 'el Boton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion players.
This is awarded at a monetary price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, has seen her drawings in the Mango branch window at Boulevard Housesmann Number 54 in Paris last night and has been almost overwhelmed by emotional shock.
In contrast, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are related to the desire to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his legal position in competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the environment of many famous people, it seems that the chairmanship organized by Mango is spectacular.
Nati, with the hard heart broken by the pain because his brother died shortly before he died. He had taken the entrance from the fashion house and had some beautiful things from ELAH, which were amazing. He remained in the arms of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and has Valentino at his dinner to accompany him to his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango's house, welcomed the guests and was such a knight, so he ended up with the baron of Rotschild without Jacketts, because Jacketts had hired the ladies.
Monica Cruz, has fallen into business and had a house and a roof, which she herself modelled, and to the dentist she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us a ball test room, so she got up, remembered for the old times, grabbed a stick and made a sort of 'grand ploe'.
Inés Sastre, did not close the passage through the space of the palace, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to find out about the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always raises a strong desire, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own belts and gloves) in the Hotel Internacional in Paris, had prayed in advance for a room free of charge.
The stars under the star-cracked sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There is no 1000 but a more opportunity to forget Chaotic daily life for us.
And even if there are few, all are gathered in a book where it is about how to relax. The book comes into the bookshops on September 30.
The week is a punishment if he hears at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, but the idea seems even worse to come back into the Hettic Rhythmus, which demands the present life.
The office is the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two ways to combat the daily creation and the problems of the working world.
However, the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to Yoga settings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book shows the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and thus comes the peace that brings the book into the books of Verlag Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who believe that it is impossible to achieve peace in such areas as workplaces with the help of personal contacts, this manual rejects such beliefs.
In addition, methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are proposed.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer increases to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to focus on the sofa, turn the brain off and focus on reading.
Talk in bed
Some kids talk tonight
I am not the ones who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you'll be late, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleepiness.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
These phenomena can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no only reason to cause this phenomenon.
At least relationships with other aspects of sleep are sought, such as alpine, panicful nights, Enureis noctura (Bettnássen night), speech in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be at very high fever, stress situations or overcompensation.
Anyway, that's a little research phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, flustered or it may be a completely opposite (scream, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and this way.
We have said that it is a positive disturbance, so it will not be treated whether it is linked to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep appnoe or stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to get the child to sleep.
So, find a quiet game for the child and avoid heavy television programs that are awful and wild.
In the case of the nervous children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
It helps the child sleep quietly.
If the speech occurs in sleep once, try to keep peace.
Thinks it's harmless for the child and the next day it'll be able to remember nothing that's happening.
Useful Tips
Don't wake it up.
That's useless, because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of bed.
Even if the child is talking, it's slow, so it's slowing down.
Think about it when it shows up after a few experiences, it is recommended to let yourself be consulted or to find out the reason why the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child is not under pressure to make an appointment and get more information.
So you won't be able to achieve anything, because when the child wakes up, it's unconscious and you can't think about it.
Besides, you'll hear what it says, but you won't know what it's dreaming and why it says it, so they'll be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it brings.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not once as a joke.
That's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that lasts just a few minutes.
Illusions ... finally
After a long walk, Illhousern on the game field is finally on a successful course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played a number of tournaments and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The time of this encounter, at which the attackers had the power to show you, was not very high.
After a first attack by the host captain of the purchaser, whose remote control was almost over the corner, Illhouses should manage the game with ease, and it was quite a different first footing with a remote, then iron with a high pass, and Romain with a seat with a footpit, which would require the opposite of Denmark.
The opposite man stopped in the middle of the field and left only the survivors of Rihai at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with the first two chances of fighting by Rihai and temporarily, and then with the first door for the Illhouses by Marais, who stood right to accept a ball that was rejected in a first attempt by Godbold.
However, the inhalation shield should not be able to enjoy its happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so that his men's cameras would have to continue to play financially.
However, Denmark did not know to take this out and no major problems were encountered by an ilhausian elephant, which only moved a little back to 'protect' its defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball, after a great divergence, was very close to the latte.
Sarkozy meets the growing fish
Before he leaves in the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will still be a fugitive in Britain.
In view of the resolved attitude of the fishermen who blocked the voyages to several Breton and Normnian ports on Monday, the French President decided to find themselves there on Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives.
Finally, they promised to receive him with a constructive spirit, and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
At the same time, the President's visit will take place as a general meeting of the Committee on the Crisis, founded by the Breton Fisheries, to take action in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached an average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martino, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies become competitive again, and to ensure the conditions of employment and the payment of souls.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they led to the Morbihan and Calvados protest march, which caused the station to run about ten kilometers long.
The cable port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-ële did not break out.
Half-Ciberon was restricted to a spree.
Already on Monday, the souls of their resolve expressed their sentiments by burning them from morning to morning on rifles and pallets before the fireplaces of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement was extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Eermel canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not come out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique broke up the blockade of the significant total raffle in Donges at night.
The Bologne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to be held in the ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the responses to the movement and on its participation in the debate planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Bretonese fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee's officials who do not support their movements.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not be followed at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Committee on Fisheries of Laurent.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel are currently about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer of `Butt Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 at the age of 83 on the consequences of Krebs in his house in Connecticut.

Embraer maintains its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian air carrier calculates this year with 215 aircraft delivered, despite the disturbing recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's largest air carrier, held its supply forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
The issue of the Financial Times follows up with the US International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, with a view to paying more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion allocated to it.
AIG is ready to control the sale of a large part of its business, over its insurance at international level and its elderly care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to verify possible sales.
No confirmation was received at the AIG.
The assets from which the AIG would possibly be separated include its flight rental Philial International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the reverse traatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and its investments in private equity, are further explained by the FT.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continued.
The AIG must soon take action to reimburse the loans over 85 billion which it has granted the federal reserve, also at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will lose the same amount.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Tower reported on Monday, after the representative chamber had returned the Paulson Plan to save the banks, a historical case of the course: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a previous loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nassday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As for the point, the most powerful case in its history (684.81 points) was mentioned before 17 September 2001, the date of the withdrawal of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The final discount rates followed by the index Nasdag, mainly related to technology, fell 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widely expanded Index Standard&Ports 500 to 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106,55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the Bank's plan for the rescue of banks by the Chamber of Regulators, which should restore stability on the markets, the Wall Street, which was already attached to the beginning of the quarter, came together.
By 228 votes, and 205, the members of the Chamber rejected the funds he had prayed to the Finance Secretary Henry Paulson.
Almost two of the three Republicans paid off their plans.
'This is a bad picture being presented in progress, which represents the Congress as unable to adopt a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market counted on this plan," she added, and feared that a project adopted in several days would come 'too late'.
"When the project is actually being condemned for fraud (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, etc. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis into the grip, which would limit the credit conditions further," Brian Bethune, Economicsman at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed that in the United States, she still prefers the feeling of extreme urgency, "that every day, it increases the reputation of a financial company" in the United States.
Following the Washington Mutual competition on Friday, the US authorities planned to sell Wachavia’s banking business by its competitor group.
In Europe, the crisis has gradually accelerated and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are 'not just an American but a global crisis', added the FTN financial analyst.
The market for basic needs has grown strong.
The revenue of the state tax within ten years has declined from 3,632% to 3,827% on Friday evening, and the revenue within 30 years from 4,161% on 4,357% on Friday evening.
Obama, winning by points in the first TV show
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, another followed to find out who won this, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats to their own victory in this television hall, which should be followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen appreciates that John McCain's performance, although visible, was not 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his return to the elections five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published a opinion question on Saturday, followed by Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that democracy makes the best figure.
In the still unclosed voters, so those on which it is now reached, Obama took 39% out of the questions as a winner, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them McCain saw as a winner.
Obama should be expected to confirm his premise on Thursday with the good performance of his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his Rivalin Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain did not want to put his unsustainable experience in the field of foreign policy ahead of him, and in this regard, it was clear that his opponent 'Navitity' would undermine the point of this first television issue.
"Senior Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be a president," he added.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican electoral power since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He went out short and precise without getting out of his face.
He drew on his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world of the United States has.
'McCain has not yet understood, Obama has already stopped', this week set up a democratic election post in which the Republicans were invited to have not realized the full extent of the crisis that is being imposed on the 'Americans from the street'.
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama mocked 20,000 people yesterday, who had assembled for an election event in North Carolina in torrential rain.
He did not even mention the words 'internal status' or 'employee'. 'The financial crisis makes Obama a clear advantage for the Americans to save the economy even at the edge of the background.
'The coming week could represent a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative frame Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compares the 'good economic instincts' with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For democratic candidates, the current crisis is a 'the final part of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After stressing that it might even be possible to reduce the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations in the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, would enhance its highest priority.
McCain, however, wanted to create a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates took note of the questions raised on the financial market's saving plan over $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was adopted last night by the Congress and was extremely unpopular with the people.
"Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?"
Young and oppositioned Sunday evening at the main square of the capital of the city of Belarus, in order to assess the results of the elections already in advance.
A few hundred white roses gathered on Sunday evening after the closing of the election site on the market in Minsk to protest against the negative nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been reported, many young people have come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator will come back'.
Some say that they haven't even chosen: 'What's good if they do it with my voice what they want' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to complete a democratic revolution.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of Visa for 40 leading white-headed persons and certain assets, could be lifted if these choices would be appreciated by the observers as purely.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census,' complained Juri Potemkin, press speaker of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous association of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, Alexander Milinkiewitsch stressed, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important to whom the votes are due, and that is the executive thing with us.
If members of the opposition join Parliament, then they are appointed and not elected.
But its entry into Parliament may mean a time of communication in television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of turning itself into a political game, because the dialogue with the European Union needs to be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly responsible for Russia, is in a crisis and we are not reforming ourselves, we are at risk of becoming a protectionist in Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the elections, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the number of electoral contributions appears too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk’s voters) has made the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice has been made?' asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition in Parliament, and those who meet the Government's proposals first.'
The silence of the night falls again over the place of October.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are pleased to see their success.
Education - From blood that has been recovered
Hema-Quebec celebrated her 10th anniversary, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because hema-Quebec has become one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she has won the confidence of the public, which has been severely damaged by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood transfusions administered by the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated by HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the discontent of the public, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994 aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that led to such tragedy, and drawing up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still trying to present his report, several provinces set up a committee on the legs, whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood reserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Committee of the Regions carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and both territories.
'1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, nearly 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood reserves and through the work in this area over the next few years, we have won the confidence of the public," she says, before being proud that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary maintains that 'trust is extremely criminal'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At this time, we experienced a number of cases in the form of human wastewater in Europe, with a new kind of creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman who has been leading since the beginning of 1998.
And we had no idea whether this disease could be transmitted over blood.
So we refer to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gelineau, which will then be applied to exclusion measures if one does not know this and if a disease is only slowly advanced, as it is clearly in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which emerges from a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease would be transmitted over blood.
This incident has shown us that the principle of caution we used has a sense.
1999 appeared on the market a much more accurate technique to identify HIV: the nuclein acid test (NST), which allows directly in the donor's blood to prove the presence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as it was in the previous case.
The NST enables you to spend the incubation time between the time during which the person was infected and when the first four can be shown by our techniques in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced at a time of less than one week.
So the risk that certain taxpayers could be infected, without knowing it, and that one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements enabled the risk of transmission of AIDS to a blood transfusion to a considerable extent.
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV infected blood.
In other words, it means that you have to distribute 12 million blood reserves before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood reserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurred when HIV was transferred over a blood reserve.
I believe that today you can feel that if you get or write a blood transfusion to restore your health, the head of Hema-Quebec will say.
}Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the safety of our products.
You don't know what disease rulers can get into the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus was detected on the island of Réunion, which, just like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor uninterrupted," Dr. Décary continues, before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
}The need increases because the people are old.
Since cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The transition of the population also applies to the blood pressure network, which includes only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec suitable for blood flow.'
Each healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the criteria for self-esteem can spend 56 days every year, so six times a year.
In the average, 14% of those who make their blood available will not be admitted because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who are displaced in a country where malaria is spread will be excluded for a year.
With this 3%, we create an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing devices are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network when they become older and cannot spend blood anymore.
It is difficult to convince people of this to spend blood, especially to keep them and bring them to become regular donors.
Life is so hot today that you rarely find time to spend an hour in blood money," complains Francine Décary.
With a annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservation but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart transplants, skin and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are tested, processed and frozen, before they are mixed with Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public swimming pool Quebecs.
In the nabelschnur, previously considered biomedical waste, there is sufficient blood in stem cells that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
"Several weeks ago, we celebrated the introduction of our thousands of nabel blood samples, and we planned to take more than a thousand years each year.
'We should start in the beginning of the next year to make it available for transplantation,' explains Dr. Décary, which describes this program as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced that they have no access to it', because hema-Quebec lacks the means to provide this complex and cost-effective program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact on semifinals
Montreal's Impact was yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-sieges (4 to 3 with all towers) against the seeds from Seattle at the second and decided game of the fourth final series in the Saputo stadium, where the total ratio was qualified for the semi-final round of the settlement of the first league of the SSL.
The middle player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive tower in the youngest minute of the game.
After a first half without a door for both one and the other, the middle-field players David Testo and Rocco Plantenino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan on the way to the southers.
We remember that at the first game of the front and back play on Friday, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2-to- 1-store in a pre-seatle.
In the semifinal, the impact will be measured with the whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compare a 3 to 1-deficit in Minnesota with a 4 to 3-six, but the whitecaps went into the semi-final round with a total drying ratio of 5 to 4 yet.
The impact will have to be compared to Friday and Sunday to the whitecaps, but the details of the game series are set today.
short said - winner by Kovalev
Number 1-Trio of the Canadian Man is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Thomas Pkelanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, delivered a tower, Plekanec delivered two proposals, and Kovalev turned a step into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolor in six preparations.
Kovalev achieved the victory by throwing the only door of all the shooters.
I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good.'
"He has made too much determination in the first half of his life, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he's got the end of the game.
He's got a storm attack.'
Charrest is located in the north
The Prime Minister does not intend to lead the elections even before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest joined Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (Link) tried to be elected in today's division.
'Translate our last big border in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, where he followed the whole line of guidance.
During his speech, a type of painting was planned behind him.
On three large screens, spectacular images of water-powered works, mountain works, from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large means such as during the selection period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from his election, even if he had allowed his timetable to be very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' which the Prime Minister has for Quebec, namely a 'new economic space', which provides for an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and alliances with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the speech of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern region in the 49th width - has not yet been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the north was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment sums or specific priorities for the coming projects.
At least a few views on what could be done more: mainly in water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mountain-building sector, benefits from the growth of coastal countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
The account of Mr. Charrests is followed by the north 'Nickle, Zinc, cupper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, Titan and even diamonds'.
This 'field twice as large as France' is in our vicinity, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our neighborhood, it's in us, he stressed how to show clearly that he's looking for a national base space.
Quebec has grown very much by its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitib, the technique Quebecs, the James Book.
"We hear it is our future," he added, after he had introduced a theoretical break to look behind the huge map.
The north, 70% of the Quebec area, concludes a part of Labrador with which Quebec has already been invited, the Prime Minister of the Press explained against it.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time when I will take this position again on behalf of the Government, he explained.
In addition, with the climate change we need to rethink our north vision, he explained and spoke about the Northwest passport, which will be accessible throughout the year due to ice cream.
Before this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to own this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the Ureas and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would deal very closely with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly former Pakistani member of Ungava) have already consulted about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and underground prices) took place, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not conclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to create a common vision'.
The development of the North will be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be 'to speak, to be regulated and environmentalally', he promises.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister who was before him at the office.
Like the liberals who were in the office before us, we have thought about changing challenges in new growth and development opportunities.
This was one of the topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the take-up of the party by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions taken provides for the transfer of the forces of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout-Studam.
"From Godbout, who created the Hydro-Quebec, about reading, which has achieved the steady revolution and the state of water electricity, to Bouursa, who made the James book, our party always knew what the future would be," said Jean Charest.
The press against him took on another conservative project this time, and on the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In relation to the project of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its launch for 2012.
'This remains under us, but I have to be there,' he confided in his partners, what was going on at those funerals.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and, of course, in 2009, has in fact not yet excluded the possibility of retaining this heritage a choice which is possible for him by law.
He stressed, however, that his timetable was complete, especially because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the Liberal Party received a platform from nationalist plans, particularly from 'the objectives of the Constitution', which were adopted without further adoption: the PLQ requires in particular the recognition of the 'Quebecs Speciality' in the Constitution.
She would also like Quebec to be appointed members of the Council of Canada's round-up and teleconference, and that they have a Veto with regard to the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were included in the design.
The chief of the Québecois Party, Pauline Marois, has re-examined the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
It said that the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, had failed to apply these principles.
If they had done so, 'we would have been much further today', Mrs. Marois told her candidate's side in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this will not only be a big idea," said the partner leader Sebastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holiday today.
Letter - An Integral Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (which irony) at the Harper Cabinet, it was the last summer that allowed him to say about Louise Arbour that it was a 'scande' for Canada.
This woman who has led an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration so much to cover with shame, says quite a lot about the people around the Prime Minister here, as Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do it here with a government that has not taken their landman who has been arrested in Guantanamo concentration camps as the only one of the countries concerned.
A government that doesn't even take into account Omar Khadr was more young than the things that were supposed to happen to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, bears its word and allows a child soldier to be subjected to non-human conditions.
The only one who turns to a justice parody to appreciate the guilt of the accused.
We call to mind, in particular UNICEF, Amnesty International and the union of Canadian lawyers to take Omar Khadr home in order to achieve a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes of the people: It is little interest for a young adult to be seriously broken after so many years of the qualifier.
We are still not aware of this, but we are just experiencing a domestic violation of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which always brings the harp before itself, and that sounds so inexhaustible from his mouth.
So the time has come in which there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can voluntarily trade, fill and block, entirely according to the interests of a head of government, who is only supported by minority so far (may he belong to the minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe to find their hero at a party who preach the law, law and order, but they do not see that this government has failed to say what has made our country's reputation and the dignity of the country.
The shadow, Mr. Toews, is in this mess, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwell Talk of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devor published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-general director of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an orbital logic that the world's largest gold-inspiring company has attempted to open a 'public transparent debate' for over six million against three authors and a small medium-sized warehouse.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely removed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruins, who is willing to represent one of their opposite views.
As the process goes, the authors and publishers of the Noir Canada Book must issue considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight against an army of lawyers who are paid from almost unskilled bags of gold.
The tactics of these unequal battles are often to destroy the defenders in order to create an acceptable arrangement that makes the opposite and also discourage anyone who is reluctant to take over the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her views before the public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on and going in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions are usually expressed in Canada by exchange of ideas and not by gossip.
It would have been sufficient if the goldmine had opened their books and documents and had opened a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent audits that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in the public opinion and weighs the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he could at the same time pray for a 'public' debate, but at the same time misappropriate the opinions of this audience?
Of course, this word includes only the widely paid lawyers in the world of the Vice-Presidents, not the Community of all Canadians; a very good way of seeing the concept.
In a democracy, the right of self-defence is the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of goldmines.
This public is ready to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many as a key complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them not to use this concept anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the finding of truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely rejects the right to quote religious sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not happen to many companies in this world, who else can do it then?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, they could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment, to which we belong, has been known for a long time to get debate and disagreement and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's irresponsibly complaint shows that she, in contrast with what she offers, has no interest in a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university's world, just as it is for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this type of unfair complaints.
Rescue action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats agreed last night on the most extensive economic reform plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan is over $700 billion, which is about to stop the financial crisis that has taken place in Wall Street for months.
The main contents are: a better control of the members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the return of the used public funds, new facilities to recover the number of houses occupied by payment claims, as well as the right to monitor the holdings paid to the leading employees of the supported companies.
US Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Appeal, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republican, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be marketable,' said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
'It was all that happened to protect the real economy and the American people before the Wall Street crisis,' the Democrats explained.
"This is the basic point: if we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disturbances in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous," explained the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, in fear of the effect that a new shadow had on the vote of the investors.
The deadline that was agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates who later participated in the negotiations proved to be more than a proponents of the agreement, but without delay, to express their discontent that they must be addressed in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama was in favour of adding certain provisions to the agreement, in particular those that would allow the owners to keep their houses and those that concern the owners of the State-saving companies.
If you ask the taxpayer to take exceptional measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain persons, it is not something you could wish to be happy with.
But these measures are necessary, he explained to the American television operators.
When he was asked if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
"The instructions I have read show that this is a thing that we all have to regret and that we can come forward with.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed to finance the taxpayer's money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, which has been resolved by the platform of an real estate blouse, which initially led to the collapse of the risk mortgage credits (subprime) before it expanded into other forms of broader loans (PCA) and finally opened up in an infringement of financial power and in the ruins of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican MEPs was that last week the first attempt was to break the agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain "guidance" assets of societies should be guaranteed only by the government and not be purchased by the government, it is believed that the cash will come out.
In order to round up the perspective for all at the convention, it has also been added to provide a statement that, if the government should make a loss of five years with this programme, it could then raise new taxes to retain its capital used.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to the next 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be accepted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
In contrast to his aid, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that, in the case of winning dividends, can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to maintain the immigration procedures for dwellings linked to the real estate credits covered by this plan, and to establish additional deadlines for the repayment and redemptions paid to the leading employees of the undertaking concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Lords to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is still not sure that her plan will be obtained green light.
In fact, yesterday further votes were raised against this project, both by the sides of the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'We are not clearly understood by Washington,' said the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Commission, his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one who is involved in asking the taxpayer for a case.
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, leader of a group at the convention called 'the Kaukus of the Sceptker', sets things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Five hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written us to inform us: We ask the Congress not to put ourselves under pressure and to carefully consider which way to go”, he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe have again shown that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial publication of the Fortis Banking Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The accession of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that they would refuse to buy their competitors who are in great difficulty since they lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis through the risk of real estate credits in the United States.
Strongly employs 85,000 people and belongs to the twenty-first European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
'This is no lost money, declared yesterday by Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos.
By contrast, we receive a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the Sparers and households appreciate, now they announce uncertain times.'
During this period, the British government was on the other side of the Ermmel Canal just to replace another bank that was forced by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would receive all the running credits at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to Northern Rock, which the British government has had to understand since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the blue eyes for a long time was his trumpet, no one would say, his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the charming narcissistic mirror?
Yeah and no.
His compassion, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent have also held him out of power, which brings him truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a long time!
On Friday at the age of 83 years, Paul Newman, who died on his stake in Connecticut, died on the consequences of lung cancer at the age of 83, remains one of the last icons of the American kinos of his years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he had been like and for a long time was a sort of rival on the Leinwand, more careful in his play, certainly even more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the inspiration of the Dramaturgic Conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and an uneducated mother.
From its European roots, one of the vast faces of the American dream should arise.
No excessive ego, excellent quality characteristics.
Because in him, a whole country that was loved in the self-made man, in the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific War, studied at the beginning of the 50's play art in Yale and then visited the actor's studio in New York before he succeeded in the theater, in television, and soon also in the cinema.
In addition to this man who fought for the rights of citizens, he was also the driver who became a 24-hour runner by Mans Two in 1979 and also a sex symbol, although he had lived in a preliminary relationship with actor Joanne Woodward since 1958.
It also removes the unknown faces of this mysterious, backward, engaged and anti-glamorous star, whose advice will never be completely resolved.
A capable man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans replaced the cinematographers this weekend in Taumel, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of the memories.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
Again, the charming Cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) goes back to memory, and the young man, whose sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor) went back to the cat on the hot flash, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
There will be a much shorter recollection (1990) that will wake up to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, in his high age, will be broken by an old age who has not fulfilled all her promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, violent, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of pressure) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought of for James Dean, was re-embraced after his death and the Newman became well-known in 1956.
This sympathic ganove in the surprising The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar in 1973 for the best film.
As an enchanted and charming Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face was behind the times he was.
He's still there.
In his course of life, Epoch joined himself.
The young man especially knows him from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of an Eishockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen in 1994.
With a final role 2003 as the Patte of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle was closed.
In contrast to several Chinese people who had returned early enough from the film environment, Newman should stay in the room for a long time and tell Hollywood, his fortune, his uncle and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he assessed his all-expressive services.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who had only so much to play for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an external page: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings, or doubters, with their perfect presentation he reflected his reflections and his recovery.
As the director, Newman filled the unknown pages of his true lenient sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the Canary Islands novel Margaret Laurence) and his wife, Joanne Woodward in the capital, drew a fine female portrait full of Melancholie.
He, who lost his son Scott through a overdose, devoted this 1984 film to Harry and Son, a work full of hostility and sadness.
In the flood of honours that last night over Newman erss, his close friend and former gunmen Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) exclaimed: 'His presence has improved my life and this country'.
Greatness and joy of life were essential qualities of the deceased player.
Apart from his legitimate career, he is now also a major defender of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinemas, an enemy of Hollywood's expulsion.
We have often seen him with his foot in glass full of Vinagarret, in sauces, bags or other foods, and this has been extremely tasteless, even though we have at first found it funny.
However, the profits from its transfers flow into its foundation for children in Not.
Instead of hanging out on his myth, Newman committed himself to the trial.
He left his five daughters a letter with these words: 'Always and until the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good stars.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor for us to follow the life of such an intelligent and great American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the deepest and most common sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of Appendix &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János began with their compliments.
In particular, the defendants are encouraged to participate in organised crime, as well as gross damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including file arrests.
According to government authorities, the funds derived from the statements were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered by fair accounts.
State funds and contributions from the Self-Management - total HUF 65 million - are expected to be part of the Fiatal Baloldal, part of private cash flows.
As notified by the intelligence authorities, fair accounts have been provided for in relation to the issuing fees, and the units should not have complied with their obligations either.
According to an estimate, a large part of the calculations should be taken into account.
The accounting blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, which was placed in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the calculations was decided on this route north of the Platten Sea, sent to the István Lados by Janos Addiglag.
Lados pensions and restaurants should be completed in the course of this "encourage tour".
He requested calculations on consumption to be made available to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the administration of Budapest on the basis of these proposals.
These calculations should be managed by István Lados and his colleagues, András Úrri, most of which should be responsible for the preparation of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Encourment Tour" was a beer resort.
As two of the additions and Co's calculations are to be taken in 2003, the gastronomic activity should have taken over the newly purchased group of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company, such a large group, would not have entered the premises at once.
Another calculation, based in summer 2002 on the Foundation Jobb Jövőret, later known as Egyyütt a Harmadik Évezred, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomy, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are expected to stay.
The imagination of the accounting fields was clearly not set at all when it went around the Pigal kft., a gastronomy operation, in its bookstores of customers Jobb Jökőret and Hoppá according to the complaint authority had not yet appeared.
As told by the Managing Director, Mr Farkas of the vvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that he had been treated as a loved one when he was submitted by the government during an investigation.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact was also false that the operation should have accommodated a hundred people, after having a total of eleven rooms that offer as many people as possible a place.
Also, if the account has been subject to the obligation, the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The purpose of this review was to verify that the Budapest travel office taken by them as a visa only offers travel abroad, and thus have provided Hungarian travel on the basis of the payment account, which is also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as in the course of the investigation, they have also introduced VAT on the calculations, although travel services which are covered by a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The amount of VAT was totaled at four from the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. at the Foundation Jobb Jövőret, since the operation is only 25 per cent VAT, and the staff are only able to issue machine invoices, which were written in writing.
Another error that had occurred to the "accounters" was that they had indicated in a case "war transport" as a result of performance, although this was not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the State administration shared with them.
Other forms of error - false accounting format, false stamp - were to be thanked that the calculations issued on Együtt a Harmadik Éveredtér Alapítvány, as well as on XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesülett and Biztos Pont could be discarded as bottles.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camper Kunfehértó, whose business leaders claimed never to have published the calculations.
Another "Failer" is the Fälschers at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyhhaza: This company was located in the period (2001) just as the group of Fiatal Városér Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore asked not to issue the calculations themselves.
Consistency is key
The other groups of the accounting officer are persons who were clearly aware that they had to lie to fictitious calculations.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjj Socialistták, the Foundation Esély Budapesttér Alapítvány has issued accounts for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredét, in an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to a complaint, the manager of the Collab Kft. was handed over by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to present the fixed accounts.
In 2003 the GmbH Foundation of Jobb Jöhéret Alapitvány, as well as the United Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfönyő Egyesüet, were to work together with the addition and co.
However, there was also a small amount of payment, since the calculations were then recorded immediately after their exhibition, but what had been forgotten by those involved in their submissions.
The third group of the accounting officer includes persons who are directly linked to the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postbot of the Ukrainian business manager of Delta Trió Kft., who is located in Budapest, where there is no available fuel and vehicle trade company.
This company is expected to have issued a number of accounts for the sale of ETV components in the total value of HUF from October to December 2005.
According to the intelligence authority, the cash investment Ltd from Kiskunhalas is to be used as the buyer of these accounts in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company’s business manager was a Romanian whose company documents should also be submitted by Ivan Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has stood during the investigation, calculated on behalf of the GmbH, to the Unity of Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to the Együtt a Harmadik  Évezredtér Alapítvány, and has cast their own value.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-investment Ltd. companies should be based on the express desire of Romanian Maureen to Ivan Kubatovs.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which was said to be charged with missing orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the company: at the request of his colleagues, the lawyer Zsolt Stente, who was responsible for the preparation of the company’s original documents, he issued calculations on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the accession, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáção.
In total, Kubatov 15 accounts are to be issued in the total value of HUF 14.2 million in the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade companies.
The government authorities believe that Cubatov could have collected 10% of the sum and VAT per year.
Kubatov should even have missed the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fixed accounts - in this case, the calculations were accompanied by the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generazione and Søvötäätäätääz for Modern Magyarország gave its applications to the Joint Organization of the Socialist Party, Tancs Máhály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 Forint, however, these amounts have been used for purpose.
To translate this, they presented the TMA's five fixed calculations of the works team Kft.
These calculations were also secured during the investigation of the office of Árpád Kemèi in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now calculated by some accused with a view to the procedure of accounting, as they have already been dismissed before the government.
It could be a feeling if the main prosecutor, Mr János, agreed to a comprehensive position.
His previous statements were much less detailed, and although he had already said more than once, including reporting about everything, his attitude is still valid.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have made a pact with him with regard to the recovery of much of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the proposal is ready to take responsibility.
However, it is possible that the attachment now plays the "accompanied" after his attempts to slow down the arrest and house arrest on dry ears.
While other criminals who have been severely damaged by economics and have not enjoyed, on a free foot, or at least under house arrest, the extension remains to be denied this opportunity.
The Psychology of the Overseas - or why we're ready to pay more
In the case of enlargement, the buyers are reluctant to pay more and therefore to overestimate the error.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological and economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in "Science" Magazine, people in a competition, like an extension to eBay, do not want to be paid and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "play" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a player action - in both cases the active brain regions of the samples were investigated through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, however, an increased activity of the band, a complex under the brain, was measured when losing the auction, with the uppers of the opponent playing a significant role.
In addition to many other functions, this hierarchical region is responsible for the "self-reliance" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that price increases were allowed to be explained by avoiding over-reaction of the fight.
In order to discourage their thesis, the economists in the research group have carried out further studies on the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should deal with a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product and then made its use.
In addition, another group was promised 15 dollars reward for the case that they were awarded as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 in advance of the auction, which was also lost in the case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis on the one on the winning, while the other on the loss was on the other.
As evidence of the hypothesis exposed by neurologists, however, the members of the group playing against the "loss" were willing to make higher use than those in the control group or the "Gwinn" group.
"These results do not come from an earlier economic theory.
These are the attitudes observed in auctions until they are only based on the joy of winning, or the risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved through the generating neurological procedures, so that we have now prepared a third statement," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York's Department of Economics.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor visiting?
Around the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is associated with leading causes of death.
The number of infections is estimated at hundreds of thousands of countries in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is said to be that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the compound term for various viruses, infectious liver diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - liver function and breast-feeding are common, however, the rulers and the diseases differ from one another.
For example, hepatitis B, C and D may be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, skeletal secretion or storage).
Travellers will be advised to administer vaccines against viruses A and B, however, against virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show approximately two or three weeks after contamination of contaminated food and are generally accompanied by nausea, fatigue, abdominal pain and bronchitis.
Then the search takes place on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the release can last for up to two or three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B, from severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cancer.
The main reason for this is that estimates are followed by only every ten infected people in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have severe consequences: it may lead to liver erythema and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease because the ruler destroys the liver cells at home - in many cases the first symptoms occur after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely warnings, such as regular controls, are inevitable.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug dependents, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already evident in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the House for the first signs of unknown origin.
Legally recognized, the disease is healthy, the virus can be removed, causing the risk of infection and predisposed to cancer.
The World Day of Hepatitis, September 30, 2004 is the first time that has been held worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen the awareness of these chronic liver disorders caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do you believe in less pain?
As recent research has shown, religious faith as a kind of "skinicide" that should already have eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was investigated that, far from believing in God, the pain of man, the British newspaper "Telegraph".
Every 12 believers and atheists received electroschocks in the course of an extraordinary investigation, while studying a map of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers were able to turn away most of the pain.
Through a brain-scan technology, it was possible to prove that Catholics could activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first to participate in a research project involving scientists, including philosophers and theologians from different departments of the University.
During the test, the samples were connected to the left hand, which gave the electroshocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: to one image of God's mother, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to another Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the believers would raise a kind of religious trace, while they chose Vinci's picture because it was hardly different from other paintings and was perceived as boring.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and at this time received 20 electric shocks at four stages, while they should either look at the religious or other images.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" at the sight of God's mother, as if they were "sanctified" and they had found "peace and peace".
During the view of the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had seen Leonardo's work before.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the attempt, said that similar effects could also be attributed to other powerful images in the atheists, but only the appropriate photo should be found.
"We had to find a picture that solved very positive emotions, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality and do so in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains, what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable event would have on the pain rule of believers.
Would the qualitative high-quality young woman Maria have even better results?
You're what you're talking about.
On their tenth birthday, Google can claim with bird and right: it is in the pockets of humans to find out exactly how they go through their heads in the sky: you know where people have taken their vacation, to which professionals they go, and what they move.
And that's still not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's business leaders.
In the direction of designers, which are made up of Orwell's Horror Visions, he can correct: these would just overestimate the essentials of the web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt recently said that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal data on the users and thus to come closer to the company’s original destination, so that they want to "order all information in this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years, Google has been changing world work since the beginning of the information collection.
Asked after the status quo in five years, she meant Schmidt: she wanted Google to be able to ask questions like "What am I going to do tomorrow?" or "What job does it really fit for me?", but the software was still not able to be able, because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet search would record the search terms, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search and later return to it so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations" are also based on what is recommended by the system's products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users ask themselves what happens in the case of a data abuse - "When you look at what I do" - some worry about the Google data monopolies.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company, the fear that works, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the struggle for freedom or the refusal to oppose the power that many Internet users have to give up.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also sent to third parties in the event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A paradigm for this was recently against Paedophilia in Brazil, where Google provided information collected by the Community website called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
For personal rights, however, users who were concerned were able to find out in May when Google, together with the Civil Law Organization EFF, successfully brought against the FBI before the court: then Google can also be forced to disclose information to the FBI on a secret request in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the issue of 50,000 websites and 1,000 search terms in relation to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users has been re-examined for two months in relation to their web and search lists.)
Google's image remains therefore controversial: Those who issue their personal data at least because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services, the company has been charged with the imposition of the companies that represent it conservatively.
In fact, the American "Geek Culture" that is present in many countries and is a favorite computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even though both fight against the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users, unlike Microsoft, an identification code, and its services are available free of charge, thus making a more open, constantly updated source code and software package far more attractive, young and cooler than the official practices of software giants.
On the other hand, the geeks look at the problem of personal rights and the Internet metrical relationship - a relationship that has been cut especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" in the middle.
The "Web 2.0" refers to nothing else than collaboration, saying that users are deliberately leaving their tracks and benefiting from the available communication channels, and even if the levels are individually different, the main issue remains the same, i.e. publicly.
A middle-aged youth can simultaneously manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, they can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally connect all of this into a tracking system such as friendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also produce blogs that automatically represent the latest photo gallerys that are placed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples show: In considering the photos of the party last night, the friend will soon find out who she has had a bad friend, or the employee will be fired because in her blog he only makes his manager air - one is sure: the term "privatsphere" has been interpreted quite recently.
Those who lead an online life are what they appreciate - so in about a year you could form the basis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even go around the Google-Monopol, can do it - like with Scroogle, a tool that accesss Google's search engine, but obviously doesn't leave any traces.
Not a few people deliberately register not on Community sites, so they are not available, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphical RSS feeds, can interact with alternative versions that are not connected to a dangerous server park and therefore not generate the most possible profile from the user.
The public opinion is waiting in line until Google shows her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the admission of advertising agencies, and the services that have been rapidly introduced are not only prepared by Microsoft, but also by other software developers.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing opposition: As soon as the group leader has rejected a protest by the employees after the company's children's fees have been doubled, it also meant that the management, which is to be costly to the employees' duties, must be just a matter of course, that Google went into the kitchen in 2006 even before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement, so that all the registrant cases, or those that would be wiped out against the good taste, would have to be filtered out.
The internal arrangement of the company indicates that no new service will be required in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could recapture a few powerfully: during some of my years, Google's book and Magazinescan or the archiving project takes into account the fact that the company was soon to be replaced with the Supreme Court, so others are more encouraged by the system 'health', allowing the creation of a complete health profile through findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - about "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes a future that will be very exciting in the best way possible, in which a human thanks to Google's data will be drawn closer.
Two young people helped the second killer of Ózd in the control of the track
In the context of the double murder of Ózd, the police now have two young people who are suspected of helping with the destruction of the tracks, shared with the police commissioner Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people were persistent, and they are now called upon for help.
According to information from the news agency MTI, it is about two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with an exemption of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under intense suspicion of killing several people from money.
In the course of the investigation, it has become clear that the 23-year-olds owed a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to compare his guilt, so he locked his fellow believers in a land in Ózd last Wednesday, where he and his nine-year-old daughter were killed.
According to the MTI, the man planned the action with a long hand - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murder with a weapon hidden in the tator.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the tattoos and the circumstances of their use.
Warsauer Börse puts a shopping cart for Prague Börse
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, have offered the Warsaw Burs for the hundreds of percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Burs.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warsaw Börse, confirmed the offer that Poland had made in spite of the fact that they had been excluded earlier from the checks as possible owners of their beer.
The reason is that the Warsaw Burse is finally the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, yet more than 60% of the paper is going to be consumed in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily "E15" reports, Poland's bids include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Börse.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Börse, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Börse and the German Börse offer.
Peter Koblic, chief of Prague Börse last week, said that from all the stakeholders, the Warsaw Börse would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not conclude that it could even lead to the closure of the Prague Börse in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Börse to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Börse is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
On Tuesday, some leading European leaves are already speaking on the Tuesday of September 11 in their comments on the ongoing international financial crisis.
The global financial disaster we have to thank the American President, namely "La Repubblica" - the President has never been able to bring his own party to the bill, which should lead to some deterioration in the situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-year-old investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be better to speak of a "second September 11th".
Some of the press in Madrid are also located in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The U.S. financial system is increasingly interconnected and will suffer worldwide.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote at the Congress, the risk that Washington has no political means for crisis management.
The world economy depends on the air, and that is just a moment, as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
You can no longer take the threat out of the act, i.e. the gender "day-announcer".
However, some countries could still make available to their money institutions that have been set up in the courts and save the banks with the money of the taxpayer before the bankrupt.
However, a domain effect will be resolved, and more banks will be involved, and then no further funding or other immediate measures will help.
For a long time, EU Member States had to jump over their shadow and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weak financial institutions, the Wiener remembers "The Standard". In addition, the newspaper continues to be more realistic that, after Americans, European taxpayers now have to get a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously affected by the crisis, which is now bound up as a tsunami over the old continents.
However, it would be wise to consider whether it would be appropriate to take into account the money of the taxpayer in order to avoid further damages immediately by several hundred billion euros.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate the immune sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, a remarkable project was presented, inspired by the Nissan engineers of hummeln in the creation of new accident prevention systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the biochemical system controlled by autobots of type BR23C, a mini-auto, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "privat area", which is very similar to our own "protection child", said Kazuhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The combined eyes of the bees, which can be seen in any direction and in a angle of over 300 degrees, play an important role.
To understand the function of the compound eye, researchers take the idea of laser-controlled distance measurement.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree face area within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately leads to the collising process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds of break, and the autobots immediately change the course, like the movement of the bees by turning the rows around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this mannover is purely instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the autobots could not react fast enough to overcome the obstacles," Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the autobot project.
The system needs to react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the inner and perturbed part of the protective shield - a sword, in the midst of the accidents, is still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees when they remove other bees.
And that has to take place in the middle of a second.
However, the deviation, in contrast to the bees, can not go up, down, or even diagonally, can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the reversibility of the branches.
While the bees here are not able to detect other bees, researchers were able to use only the movement of motor vehicles, relative to speed and brake.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer life span than the usual lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of data, and less to the ability to store them.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It doesn't have to save these, or produce an intuitive, logical response through previous manoeuvre, so it's only taking a full KB memory in charge.
There is no need for a gigabyte and megabyte memory.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collition prevention technology, which will be in production in the next 10 years following Nissan's assessment.
Another application could find the technology at the GPS satellite navigation by letting the driver know about obstacles and thus lead him to the target.
A name for the child that will be born
Now, the written version of the 700 billion hard saving package budget, which will be used in several stages, aims at the purchase of the bank's bad credit.
For the first time, half of the money should be spent.
At a meeting that took place after midnight at the end of the Middle Ages, after several days of debate, the members of the Congress agreed on an agreement over the $700 billion heavy relief package, reported Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, a democratic president in the U.S. House of Representatives, and thought that the agreement should only be made on paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson pointed out the outcome: the programme will be effective and will need to do more. According to Pelosi, it was not here about the rescue of the Wall Street, but rather to break the turn of the economy.
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington Time Sunday afternoon 8 hours (medium time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not release a high-fashioned flight to the pools.
On Monday, the House of Lords will first agree on the draft legislation to stabilize the economy in 2008, and then the Senate will be on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday afternoon with Pelosi, and the white house welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
The programme, however, is based on the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, whereby the 700 billion dollars should be issued once for the purchase of counterfeits, with credit charged securities.
In a first round, half of the 700 billion contracts are to be issued, with 250 billion available immediately after the convention is expected to be concluded on Monday on the cause. This sum is to be set up for the purchase of credit-cards, bad securities, and over the remaining 100 billion USD will be decided by the President.
The programme shall be reviewed by a Commission itself, which shall also be the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion will depend on another decision of the Congress.
In the meaning of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combination of tactics: it can purchase at the same time bad credit, mortgages, and mortgages with mortgages, or other "guidable" credits.
As officials of the ministry reported, the purchase can be carried out both in an auction and directly.
The law enables the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme guaranteeing the Ministry of Finance the care and to pay the companies the corresponding fees expected to be paid.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary resources so that up to $700 billion can be made available as aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a system risk that will be solved by the collapsing of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, as Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks that are in difficulty and now referred to as state aid can count on the government to cut off their cut-offs that are called the Golden Handshake in the Overseas Slang.
A reduction of the debt will only be given in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists each.
The cut means that if the ministry purchases an auction, then the Golden Handshake will be awarded, because the issued bank chief will be retired.
In the case of a direct purchase of the missing credit, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the managers are not transferred.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more people are involved in the program.
This is the first case in the history of the United States that cuts in managerial debt are regulated by law, the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State is entitled to participate in the participating banks so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate, as the economy and thus the saved bank will continue to improve.
The draft legislative proposal provides that the President must extend a proposal to the Congress in the next five years, how the taxpayers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were two sides of the scepticals who have raised their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not, however, protect the money of the taxpayer, such as the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Captur said: The measures were taken by the same persons who are also responsible for the Wall Street colleges.
Continue to increase industrial prices

A price reduction was recorded in raw oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and in wood processing (0.1%).
The prices remain unchanged in paper production, as well as in the production and printing industry.
A price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent has been measured in other areas of the processing industry.
In the major domestic waste markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rise by 0.3 per cent in August, primarily due to the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
In view of the domestic retail markets of the processing industry, the prices in raw oil processing have increased to the highest degree (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.

In the sectors produced by consumers, a price increase of 6.8 per cent has been observed, while the price decrease of 1.4 per cent has been observed in the appellants.
The export prices of the industry in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, however, by 3.9 per cent in the year.
The domestic currency grew by 1.7 per cent, by 7.1 per cent weaker to the dollar, and compared with the August 2007 rate, it grew by 7.5 per cent, even by 15.9 per cent.
No more visas in the United States since 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to take effect on the 12th generation, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In your view, "depends now only on whether the electronic immigration approach control system will be introduced in oversea at the right time."
However, she also stressed that in the new system no travel permit will be granted, but the tourists had to register in advance.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy now leads negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condolezza Rice, who will overcome the "Miller Service Cross with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and also conduct talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican Presidency candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, announced their support for the $700 billion heavy savings package for banks on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who demand the return of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and representatives of the government announced on Sunday that they had come to an agreement on the Bank's settlement package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the establishment of the single credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better suited than the respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Following recent questions, Obama was able to further develop his leadership thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's High, which protected him from the presentation of the Vice-Presidentship candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was also killed.
In an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would soon adopt the law over $700 billion in heavy packages.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passengers of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, and although responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, the whole industry, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened," he said before 35,000 observers.
He didn't forget to name McCain's business visions as "obsolet".
In an interview given by the ABC sender, McCain stated: "We're all going to have a hard time... but no alternative is certain."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also proposed the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of appointments for top managers - something on which he was responsible.
The CBS said Obama, McCain had no definitive role in the negotiations, although he, Obama, was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the representative's house, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably be voting on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-language space
The right layer is intact, only the voters have been aware of themselves within the camp - so "The mirror" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haiti and Co are ready to rule in order to prevent a red-black coalition.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online release of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic decline of CSU in his article "Bayers Revolution Continues Their Fathers".
In the view of the renowned politicians, the erosion of the CSU began long before the tragic Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over its mother.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bayern over decades - now the modern citizens are just turning away from them.
At the same time, the Epoch bridge is a problem of Christian democracy as well as for Angela Merkel.
Not surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not occur, but on Sunday something went to the end, but what has already been recorded almost ten years ago: the undisclosed hegemony of a State Party.
Because already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU has reached 47.7 per cent and this has been happening for the first time since the five-year period under the five-percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Federal elections, which is still in the so-called Stoiber era.
CSU's subsequent modernization in Germany has in a good way continued its own mother and father.
Sociologists had predicted it 40 years ago, but in time, it became very expensive. However, without any effects, secularization, the consequences of education, of east and north-east exchanges, could not remain on the confidence of the CSU voters in the more advanced regions of Bayerns.
Modernization is always the same with options, and that has political consequences.
The right warehouse is intact - only the voters within the warehouse have become more critical and self-willed.
It is unfortunate that in the last few weeks, the classical bourgeois groups have just extended the largest distance to CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with Abitur as high-school closure.
Here the support of the CSU is low by 40 percent.

The Conservative Wiener daily newspaper reports in its "Who With Whom? Participating in Coalition Questions" article on the Chaotic Intergovernmental Position in Austria after the New Year's Eve.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The SVP prohibits the inclusion of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ shows itself openly in all directions for discussions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish a coalition.
The novels are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public-law television, the party leaders have never looked at their cards.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the OVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could represent a coalition with Wilhelm Multer, the current head of OVP as a vice president, opened Faymann.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Schüssel-Molter course.
A repetition of this approach was not in question.
Mulder has responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he felt that if Faymann tried to involve himself in the internal affairs of the OVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or the coalition is now fully open, and these issues should be discussed within the OVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed himself openly in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take responsibility for government," Haider said.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European summit has begun to have the chance of equal opportunities, which will be set up by the European Presidency of the European Council of France.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party's Party, focused in particular on the education collection, as this is one of the most serious violations that the Roma children face, and this is the greatest obstacle to their functioning.
The High Conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Council Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Employment Commissioner, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, and the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the Press Office of the EP officials of the Fidesz reported, Járóka pointed out that in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma would be affected primarily by their low level of education from the labour market.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma-young people have no secondary education, and because of poor basic education, only a small part of them can reach a higher education".
Járóka further stressed that education is a fundamental human right that has a key role to play in the creation of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the view of the rapporteurs, it is important that this context will become known as a broader circle - so Rome and non-Romana.
As a Roma student starts school earlier, his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase, and through income and consumption taxes they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated education must be introduced," says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a joint, targeted and action-oriented action by the European Union is necessary to speed up the deregulatory process in the education sector, and this is impossible to achieve the correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the opportunity to contribute democratically to Europe's future as full-time citizens," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the achievement of the objectives of equal opportunities and free of discrimination at European, but also at national level, within the meaning of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities'.
CSU: Time-to-time care
At the end of October, the duos Huber-Beckstein of the fall will be selected
Despite the election break, no heads still roll, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debate was rejected.
Mr Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace has been granted.
On the end of October, after the 17 per cent loss of voice, Tandem's ship will be selected on the outer part of the day.
But the very stolen duo had already seen that it didn't want to lie on her knees.
In this way they want to address the neglected group and the party base, which one day after the "babyeric Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career height, the Christian Social Union reached another 60.7 percent. However, only 43.4% of the votes could be won a year after the Putsch against Stoiber.
The CSU was a 46-year-old "alleinregier" in Bayern, the 18% of the German GDP.
While the conservatives remain the decisive force in which the Hungarian economy is important to the south, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructuring, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister Horst Seahofer will also be joined by the research team, which will lead to a possible Munich Coalition with the liberal FDP, with regard to the legalized "Free Elections" polling talks on a possible Munich coalition.
A irony of the ship's salt is similar to that of the list "Free Elections" that Gabriel Pauli enters into the legislation, whose anti-stoibers have used the Huber-Beckstein Duo first to ensure that the target politicians will soon be out of service.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its efforts on the stabilization of concretes.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who had long taken the paths from the background, will become an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU president announced on 28 September the "best day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few positive comments to the CDU - according to his view, the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister's party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the download as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at the national level in 2005, should not be put on the legs again with a common force, Markel will not be able to become a Chancellor after the federal elections in September 2009.
Markel, who has not made any sense from her disappointment about the Fiasko, believes that CSU's land loss will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the weakened CSU will not be more manageable, and the crisis of the social democracies continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best results in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, there was no representative of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is in the welfare and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, which, however, the OECD condemns legal shortcomings in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
However, the legislation of the 10 million inhabitants has come out of existence for decades without opposition. However, the opposition party gathered under the name of the "Verior Democratic Forces" (ODS) has been seriously hoping that Lukaschenko, who, in the absence of a constitutional change in 2006, would have renewed its presidential mandate for the fourth time, this time to "allow" some of the opposition's members in Parliament.
That is why the ODS even removed from the previously planned Boycotte.
Ukraine is increasingly dependent on increasing prices for imports of gas from Russia, even for the reduction of price increases, and the country has also accepted the consumption of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading the country, to Russia. Thus, in the light of the prospects of the opposition, the hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU, following Lukaschenko and other high-level politicians, because of the anti-democratic political system in the EU.
For a temporary delay, the OECD's evaluation report of the elections, in which the emphasis was on positive movements, rather than on the weaknesses - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report has already criticised the campaign on Monday - then the opposition must not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition did not remain in force when the votes were counted.
Nevertheless, the opposition was able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners were placed on a free foot, and Minsk is even ready to face smaller confrontations with Moscow, by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the native Georgian provinces of South-East and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine formed a federal state on the paper, which has been viewed as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps ahead and a step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Millinkewitsch to our page.
In view of the opposition candidates for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, even though "the powerful are afraid to leave only one opposition in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have fought here with many problems - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us on the road when selling stones, but I can still see that more people support the change, even older ones," Millinkewich pointed out in a statement that the current pensioners' share with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only service is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's guilt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a question of the time until the "social security" of a peaceful building begins to break up," says Millinkewitsch.
In contrast to the opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, explained to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in the words and not the words."The lack of opposition is therefore evidence of the ranks of the White Russian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on it will be cut off before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are portable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From now on, the action will be taken against those who smoke first and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Gesetz was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers' Bureau.
">"Transportable doors would be a means of increasing labour efficiency through higher availability and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta stressed once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says this: "The choice of the portable doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no opposition from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, therefore, there is no breakfast at work any more; finish with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas, in this regard, has a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracles".
During a meeting of the Administrative Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Publica Administration)
from Rome, the Minister reports that "in three months, workers' absences have reduced to 50%, which means that 60,000 people are more at work every year".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"the wage dynamics - so did the Minister - have doubled in the last 8-10 years as large as the private sector and far beyond the rate of inflation."
Among them are thousands of officials gathered to work with the Brunetta Decree in the framework of the Codacons-supported profession.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of fewer absenteeities at work - this is how the Consumer Centre writes - the population of 'actual fraud' is growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to explain the illegal norms of the decree to the war."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting additional financial imbalances for the condition of work; the planned extension of the compulsory home-care centre of the sick worker, while monitoring visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's renewals will be considered.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents is crucial"
Every day in Italy there were 2500 accidents at work, three people died and 27 people were permanently disabled.
For the year 2007, the data of Inail (Istituto nationale controgli infotruni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents occurred at about 1200.
These figures describe the severity of a phenomenon, which almost doubles as many deaths as caused by death.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will be held on the 58th national day for the victims of labour accidents in order to reduce the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of this day confirm how crucial the issue of prevention is at work," the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nationale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State has expressed its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of victims' families and the awareness of public opinion".
"A popular "Basta" has risen above this; of course, in tragedys that are measured by their size order, some vibrations in the media and participation in the public. However, daily reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not forget that "there is also a resource problem: it must be invested in education and information crucially."
It is particularly important to take the many initiatives for a direct awareness-raising in schools from young people who live in the working world.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to withdraw from its social burden.
On the other hand, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed "that the phenomenon of the deaths in the working conditions constitutes an urgent social emergency which equips the consciousness of all of us and forces all institutions to work on certain rules that aim to end the problem".
"The data on work accidents appear to be an easy signal for improvement, but this does not mean that the number of deaths required to work is too high," said President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That is exactly what leads to tragedy at the end."
"We believe that you are taking too little to avoid the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight it by various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary for our opinion – such as Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to clarify the workers who are already in school.”
"An additional effort is needed - he adds - what is the communication and awareness of the public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility is asked by the employer's side of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke about "the continuing deterioration of the protection of workers' job losses" and launched the "repealing of the social system against which we have fought in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to restore the employer's guarantee of insurance so that the amount of the victim of an accident does not depend on voluntary or temporary expenditure, which will be decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player in charge: Risk of hearing damage
Play music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report published in Brussels today, welcomes the opinion of Csseri (the Scientific Committee on Current and Recent Health Risks).
"From the report – so it is noted – it is clear that 5-10% of those who listen to music sound music with portable music devices for at least five years at least one hour a day, risk the loss of their audience."
"I'm worried that so many young people, who usually put portable music devices and phones on a high volume, do not know how to harm their audience," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – so it is called from the Eu – a clear risk is shown, which requires fast-acting.
What really counts is to raise awareness of consumers and make these information shared.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine existing control systems so that they are fully effective and continue with the new technology."
Brussels was responsible for the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"The scientists - so concludes the EU communication - confirm that you are rightly concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other Eu Members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and young people from the heat that comes from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard, which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damages that could result from excessive noise pollution.
These damage can be very limited, in which solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of noise wear are taken.
In her report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu points out that when users of portable music devices hear only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) of music (more than 90 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of the audience within five years.
So 5-10% of users of such devices can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu area.
Roma, Germano has the Committee on the "Commission on the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March, to be past, in June, the balance will be taken.
This is the schedule set out in the Chapter for the work of the 'Commission on the Future of the Capital of Rome'. The Commission met this morning at the new sitting behind the Caracalla terms.
In six months, President Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is finished, the city and community council will assess the analyses and projects to be able to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor of Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," said Germano. "It will be a proposal for a development plan for Rome, which remains the political responsibility of the City and the Community.
There is no redistribution of duties, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will re-examine itself, as such a project must have a certain point of time.
In June - so announced by the Mayor - we will introduce the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence because they feel bound by it, the Germano says: "All the work that the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals will depend on.
If they, as in France as the Attal Commission, deliver quality results – and this will certainly be in Rome – then their contribution will be fundamental.
More often, policies deal with the daily problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, however, want to have a longer period of time to work with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The mayor of Rome puts a lot of value on this point to clarifying "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a work: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roma citizens a cent and it will bring us back to our minds, and it will be the best head of the capital".
According to Germano, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan, which is neither hermetically nor static, in order to enable our city to have a quality source - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step in the future."
A future, such as the mayor of Rome, who "is not only limited to the current municipal borders, but will be seen much more," not only with regard to the role of Rome as a Metropolis and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much of it, has written: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, delimited the U.S. economy and established relations with the affected Islam (and still doing so as a private man)".
The attacks against Obama will always be more intense, just now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very happy: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
However, these attacks do not have much to say; it is racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the elector: will he be a good president? And then there are also the questions; everyone says that Obama will be won with a great advance.
In this case too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: first we will know who the real American patriot will be given his voice.
Here, a mentality of the United States appears to have been kept hidden until recently.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to do for Obama or McCain."
There are people there who are black: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Something you never heard before – just now where the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush make during his term of office? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America's changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back to the house with a trit in the interior.
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak spot.
The person who takes his position is in charge of a serious task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its tracks with journalists: in the newspapers, it can be seen as the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control about the future.
Today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not really worry about the information about officials because of general credibility.
They don't feel as old as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems are due to the cuts in the newsroom, so the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the great public understands it, is not seriously breaking.
A clearer but complicated pessimism is being fulfilled today by the American journalist.
Six of the 10 journalists and executive seniors of the press are of the opinion that journalism at national level is on the wrong path.
In the local area, it is even 65 % of the executives.
Dr. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine where the web goes.
The most important dropout groups are based on the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The economic pressure, which journalists fear, has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have agreed to join the new technology in the hope that "it will bring something good for journalism".
The largest rice is today in American journalism between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for it.
56% of the chief editors at national level are sure to share their values with them, while it is only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work".
The business leaders who fear losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
There are 30% in the journalists.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", etc.) is always an issue in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under the contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million citizens and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio and TV transmitters and Internet employees, workers offer them a question of take it or leave it.
The chief editors receive very often very high wages, however, the editor can only receive EUR 10000 per month to pay interest and insurance money.
As far as the holiday is concerned, the matter will be complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so much after the third time, to finally reach a certain number of years of 15 birthdays.
But the American journalists will be, as they themselves are given, often "sick".
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IN ROME: DANILO COPOLA BLEIBT IN GROETTAPERRATA
The President of the second court in Rome, Carmelo Rinadou, decided to cancel the request for the property owner, who had asked him to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It shall be reported against Coppola because of the bankruptcy investigation of the agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a permanent duty in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked him to allow the real estate owner to be transferred from the province to a apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, he could have been given the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence against him.
Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, when the Chamber of Commerce voted against the 700 billion dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans were and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the strict edition of the New York Times, which tells how the crisis is spreading to the Republican party, which is increasingly expanding in its old and moderate East Coast-souls, which has always benefited the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are "those in Washington" and the financial community, and have won in the south and the centre of the electoral States.
This part of the party thanks its rise rather than the vote I mentioned above.
This same example is only a small part of the major changes that announce or even represent the current economic earthquakes: not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the West, and may also be affected by them.
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-term fears of events that end up being created and brought to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the discovery of the unfavourable renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banks and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad, and at the same time manages an unhindered amount of private holdings that live in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: as it is appropriate to deal with the families concerned, which is also a huge electoral mass.
So the crisis seems economicly global, but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalism seems to have been lost and lost its right to speak: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which has led to its duplication in various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, all are now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, etc. distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become ever more serious, only the United States has been able to survive in the economic situation without foreign aid.
In addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: so two conditions – under certain circumstances – are not likely to be reversed by an international organization or market in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that is being brought into the economy with a most closely linked sector: territoriality.
Paradoxer's way is now, if we were so convinced of it, that long as we were involved in a networked community, in a range of always differentiated technologies, we have to establish at once how our future will depend more on the essential material things: water, land and oil.
Although all of these can be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are still linked to an extremely complex piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the advantage of those who have such a territory is that of another who lives in a land free of waste, waterless or oil-free areas.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, provides for a brief introduction.
Who's the territory, who's the government, who says politics, that's what Leadership says.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of equipment on the existing guidelines, i.e. those of the economy that have emerged as insufficient and full of damage zones.
Finally, there is an even more profound and disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, a lack of patience, an image of ineffectiveness, a feeling of remoteness, which is all directed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems this way that the conviction among large parts of the population is that it is not only the actions of social elites, but already their ideal world, their Way of Life, their culture, in the farthest sense of the word, that they hold the majority as being foreign and superior.
So the demand for leadership is undersided by a strong but powerful movement of the design of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This is reflected in the unprecedented "revolved" of the voters and in the undisputed conversion of the collective support status of the last time: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bayern, through the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of American officials against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights in Italy is also a role here).
The impression of older elites, their partners, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, increasingly understanding problems, and hence less representative values of what is going on today in the lower social spheres of the West, and even stronger from the financial crisis, and to the excessive dimension.
In view of all of this, it would be difficult to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But it's not safe to keep your eyes open.
The supersede that lets you up to the walls
The forces of gravity are thanks to a fuel and can lift walls like superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now likely to reach the goal.
With a layer of only 2,5 sq cm, the researchers have been able to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a narrow wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material obtained by the research team is a further development of the fuels already used, which is used as a special carbon structure called carbon nanoresults.
"The principle of the Kleber can be presented as a series of stapel spaghetti arranged in rows," says Zong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired themselves by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic brains that give the animal a perfect halt.
The tests carried out with various materials such as Glass Teflon and Schleifpaper showed that the new garment is ten times stronger than the resistance of the feet of the reptilians and at the same time "freely remove the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
"This material could be used as an available fuel", adds Liming Dai.
How about driving Spiderman to the walls? Perhaps already, though, researchers think more about a less fascinating use, such as the connection of electrical devices, because nanorecks are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Further areas of application could fall in the area of space.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
The other art of FORSCHUNG – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of clothing.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a carbon from microfacers that cleans themselves like hair by moving on a surface itself from dust and thus maintains a perfect load.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription: Never take fruit juice
Prevention of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin content, can cause severe health damage if they are taken with certain life-threatening medicines, as they can affect the intake by the body in an extreme way.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, again points to the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with drug intake. Within the framework of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he re-emerged a warning: A glass apple, orange or grapefruit juice is available to reduce the intake capacity of certain vital medicines to be practically eliminated and thus to endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of certain medicines such as antibiotics, antihistmatics, heart surgeons, angiolytics and neurological agents to toxic levels.
MEDIUMMENTS IN GEFAHR – The same medicine agency had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture in a report two years ago, and stressed what to drink in connection with medicines such as diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT NUR GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that may contain medicines.
The list of active substances hidden from the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the University of Statale di Milano: "These results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are so eager to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you read the package leaflet regularly and that if there are any signs of a lack of clarity, do not ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the Ansa Agency’s expert stressed.
Economic Nobel price goes to Paul Krugman
The economy's Nobel Prize is at the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the possession of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular article for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic and external policies of the Bush administration.
A few months after the accession of 11 September 2001, during the day of the Enron Summit, Kruggman had claimed in a leading article of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A predictor that did not receive a little Polish as an answer and that the economy was still maintained years later, but today seems to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals has disappeared in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom from the public field," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "econom of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush Government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "anti-Microphone" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software has won as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under freeware and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office will now present itself with some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now spartan-designed initial menu, it is finally achieved on the basis of enhanced compatibility with Apples operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, thus providing the latest standard ISO version.
Eight of them were also able to read on the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, its new format (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) by OpenOffice.
Interestingly, there are also some new features that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e-mail sending. This also allows you to import PDF files into the graphical editing module and to save the original appearance image of the page.
This allows you to generate hybrid PDF files, which expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format on the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most powerful elements of applications: tables can now be processed several times by different users, avoiding conflicts when changes occur; in the case of the text processing system, a question will be given to each processor to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result should be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/Download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Apart from Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
Even if the freedom of spending can be a challenge for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also just in the business area where OpenOffice could win the great war: in the end, there have already been different public administrations and schools to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even lacking in a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opening business views.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the word corresponding text configuration program; Calc, the table program that aims to destroy Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the known access; and last draw, a graphics module.
The 2008 target is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by now 3 million and 600 thousand.
Coal also tested positive and thus the fourth doping fall
It opens up a new doping fall within the last tour of France: it's about the Austrian sporter Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-class winner and the winner of the tricot of the best writer.
The message published the newspaper L'Equipe on her website.
The 26-year-old cold from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positive on Cera, the Epo of the third generation. This was already met by the Italians, Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli, as well as by the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood tests of coal consists of those performed in the last few weeks by the labs Losanna and Chatenanay-Maabry.
If the tests are to confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrians will lose their third place and be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive message and informed the Austrian officials of the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrians, behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also claimed the triumph of the best writer for themselves.
COVER SUBJECT: THE NEW YORK TIMES: IS IT POSSIBLE?
Italy, "the single country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which will only be taken up with a return.
Does this make a nation of racists from the Belpaese? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the whole subject of racism in Italy, and from the case of the young, proud Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he was charged with packing a case.
The case is from what the times refer to as "paradox of the north": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" are found and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrantist sentiments and the highest support of the Lega Nord".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the times are called on for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the speedy designation of illegal immigrants is also introduced as a sign of the climate change in Italy.
A movement that also undermines the pope and the president of the state: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State in combating racism."
Students Offers up to 900 Euro per room high rent prices
The market for housing for students does not know any crises.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the rent company, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very difficult lessons. All the students lose their right to study in fact because their families are not able to support them in this way," said the officials of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities, the great demand from the students is for a deformation of the market that has also damaged the rest of the population.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of losses: free contracts, missing registrations, no rent price limit, unauthorized rents.
For the Sunia, the need for exceptional measures, which will lead to a revision of the price lowering of taxes.
In the context of the investigation, it is clear that in Milan a sleeping place is needed in the fourth Brianza EUR 450; a single room begins at 650 euros (in the fourth band Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the fourth Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the fourth Victoria.
In Florence, a bedroom costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the squares around the university, there are 250/280 euros for a bedroom of nuts, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the quarters around the Union are approximately 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the rents in the squares around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who can save money in external areas can save money: 300 euros for a bedroom and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar rooms.
In Naples, you need 300-450 euros for a bedroom, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bedroom costs EUR 250-350, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities the prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting for foreign European students is more common, as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is about 25-30% above average is requested by foreign students.
Looking back to the old Chinese Paradise – the cities close their historical cinemas
The historical kinos are closed because of the favored multiplex kinos.
"A city without kinoselle is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with an effect what is currently happening in the major cities of Italy, as well as in the provinces.
The process of eliminating the kinos, which began with the birth of the great multisial complex in the Periphery, means long term vision of the death of the singlesalkino in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and undisputable but also involves the practice of a cultural crime.
The most historical places are full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom a piece of the street has become full of emotions," so the director of the film "New Cinema Paradise", who introduced him 20 years ago to the Oscar and the great price of Cannes. It is about the history of a city cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-being of the lost kinolel.
The figures, which the Anec, the central business link, speaks a major language: in the last five years, the number of irregular traditional kinos has to be closed in 316; these tens paid mostly to the Chinese in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Nepal, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most powerful regions affected include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost kinos, followed by the Toscana with 44 and the Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex kinos, because it is just these three regions where the largest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardy leads the list, 81 are both in the Toscana and in the Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures are also developed, but firstly, the acquisition of the existing hall, because it closes a hall in the city, is not all of its customers, rather than an old multiplexkino in the Periphery.
There is still a lack of state for the fund of the association outside the law: the debt debt recorded by the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame from the ethical and moral position that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be spent in the year of nuts".
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to which it has decided to protect it by means of an agreement between the Community and the Anec; it is about the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures provided for include tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in relation to transport: it is allowed to travel in the restricted areas of the centre and also to park cheaper parking charges.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
However, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to handle something against the superpower of multiple cells, as the audience is finally more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinemas has always been an important theme for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the outstanding point that led me to build the "New cinema Paradise" even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; if I survive in the Rialto or Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to not have to see the stacked plates.
The links between politics and 'Ndragheta' lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The charges against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torione and his deputy representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning because of developments in Mafia are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the oldest mediator between the Clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer who bears the same name as the Clan's boss, has already been sentenced to the development of Mafia's criminal associations, at the time to a fine of EUR 10 million.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard is wrong," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromelli money for advisory work."
"The Mafia group was thus made possible – so the judges – to formally enter the councils and to adopt the policy of public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazione Louiero, does not agree that in his region "all other than an exception is to stand in relation to local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white west."
The arrests of today's morning follow those of last July, with which the police of the Clan Piromalli were arrested.
Since the end of the last April, Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but since 1991 – and at the same time because of the alleged links between organised crime and local administration – the local politicians of their community have been shaken.
Giorgio Dal Torione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected as head of the Central Law Association in May 2006.
He wrote a scandal as the Prefector ordered the resolution of the Community Council.
He was interested in finding out all the political and strategic reasons he had in mind in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, but the judges explained in connection with the command of tomorrow that the Piromalli-Clan had even expected to apply for a change in the A3 project.
From a hearing related to the studies on the Dal Torion case, it has shown the willingness to resist the wishes of an entrepreneur who, at least, is a representative of the large group around the pyromelli – thereby making public administration's actions identical with the interests of this clan."
When energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the bigs run on
It is a non-confidential source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now it seems to understand the world's major energy companies.
Wells, flows and times are the new renewable sources of energy on which all look now, and also search to occupy, like giants like Chevron.
The opportunity to gain energy from the sea's movements has been taken into account and examined for 70 years; these studies have not gradually intensified since the first global crisis.
When the oil price was introduced in 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now the environmental organizations and the rising oil price are forced to new impulse in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This is equal to the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and seasons are still coming.
The giants at the attack.
The first firm that is now on the marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published it seemed to take a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are still more companies from the traditional energy sector, which are based on marine energy gains.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – so the speaker of a company known as the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal – and forces us to work together."
This is in order to obtain an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project ahead of Alaska's coast.
This is a non-exhaustive sign, i.e. if you think that in Alaska oil will continue to be promoted by the United States and President Bush has recently set the plan for new drills.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verden Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are also unknown, but observers speak of a growing interest.
Even improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in use, which is not yet clear, since the latest doubts about environmental protection are not yet made clear.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are less small and seem to cause no serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy at a large level, technologies need a far greater impact on the environment.
There are different options: Ocean Power is about to use a system of connected bojen.
The shell of the waves, which move up and down the bojes, is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the refrigerator over coal and cylinders.
This leads to a turbine, which once again acts as a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast by means of underwater guides.
To date, there are four planned installations of this type, which are still awaiting State approval. Some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping house and a parking lot using underground turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the times lead to the turbines that feed the generator through the current movement.
According to Verdant, there is already a long gap between potential customers on the necessary authorisations to use these sources of energy.
First the waves, then the seasons.
A special interest, according to the Institute for Energy Research, is immediately worth the potential in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the weather is more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of energy.
It is true that in 2008 it was estimated that Germany, such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal countries, had already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million had been planned for 2009.
