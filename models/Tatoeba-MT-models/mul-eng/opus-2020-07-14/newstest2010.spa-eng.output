Barack Obama will be the fourth US President receiving the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, such as the fourth US President of history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be received, inter alia, by exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian Metropolis in the morning and have much to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where you will first meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected it between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Thereafter, the presidential couple has scheduled a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the evening, the visit will end with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious Gilead.
He will be the fourth president of the United States who receives him, although the third one who receives him in his charge.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His military efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During its complete programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama had a more well-served attitude towards the award from the outset.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that you don't deserve everything.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him but for all who struggle for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".

Brno doesn't like the contents too much to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate drinking packages and in the villages of southern Moravia can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And Brno?
Allies need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't stand apart for nothing.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city in the Republic, associations are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is completely late in separating bass, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially by the number of containers for these wastes.
Have you ever tried, for example, to take a PET bottle in the center to the appropriate container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is at the Moravské nammestí square, opposite the Porteféná Huse.
Don't get angry with me, Mr. Anderka and his companions, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that it is also not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By Vagancia
What's going on is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to take several bottles of glass and plastic to the bathroom.
But there was no red container near the Kauniciva Street.
Luckily, I found the right place on the tranche.
The trash, however, had already been emptied of the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What's happening is that ecology and aesthetics don't seem to interest the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy in the city the hockey extract, which shames us in all the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypotheses, after browsing the Internet a bit, with official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst of the entire Jihomoravský krakj region.
The budget for "Paroubek" has been spent on pensions and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the Government's opinion, additional funds may be added to farmers or officials, the budget may not have enough money for pensions, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of State debt nor international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of the coming year, says Hazienda Minister Eduard Janota.
When social Democrats and communists pushed forward the increase for some groups, they were confident that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive costs, interest or sickness subsidies. "That only suggests that the problems for the future are to be tackled, it is to place mines," Janato says.
What is happening is that when money is taken up, you have to pay higher interest rates and, someday, you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options to earn money.
If it does not reduce the social subsidies or operating costs of the State, it must increase taxes.
To all who added the left now: bombs, masters, farmers.
And, later on, also to your children.
People don't have to worry about the sickness benefits or subsidies, they'll receive them.
But the price to pay will be the increase of public debt; the coming year will not be lost in the treasure only 163,000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer come with a slight increase in VAT or reduced maternity subsidies, as the Government did in its package against deficit.
Due to the shifts of money in favour of some electoral groups, the coming year will also require five billion dollars to complete the construction of buses and railways.
It is, above all, of the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The maximum you can do is save them, which is also not free.
This means a delay or end of the thirty major buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the ČEZ dividends, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it about an empty bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 000 million to the budget.
Each year dividends are liquidated by environmental damage, they serve to complete the interest account or serve as reserve for the preparation of interest reform.
In addition, this trend, according to EU rules, increases the real deficit of the budget at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
Carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget in order to grant various compensation to the victims of communism and crime, or for the costs of fighting, even in the construction process.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lotteries.
If we lose some international fight, we may have to pay it, Janato says.
Thereafter, the Minister will have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, leave the Government's budget reserve.
There are also hundreds of millions already missing for the state-owned state-owned project, whose price is of 2 billion and which has already been started. It must be allowed to monitor online what the different authorities are spending.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to cease and sanctions will be imposed, Janota warns.
Your future smart phone can work with two operating systems
The United States will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, change between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they pass in seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is precisely the objective of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on developing virtual software for computers.
On your mobile you can take two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both of them operate at the same time as Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year, and several days ago it was shown for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the systems mentioned, Windows Mobile and Android, work at once.
The development of new mobile telephone technology is in its support.
VMware works with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concerns hotels
Not only the Telexers in Krkonoše worry about the tracks without snow.
The lack of snow makes people don't book ski resorts in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but still fear of booking with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, if these Navidities will have snow or bar," said the holder of the computer portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in Špindlerův Mlýn a Nochevieja according to their expectations should not doubt the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
The hotels in Špindlerov Mlýn offer most of the weekly stations for Nochevia.
I think they'll continue to offer them, but soon they'll deliver and offer shorter stops.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, I loved Jandura.
Ingotors, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter days.
Now what we're interested in most is the navie week, which is still not complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some lately navigable stations," Intours Director Petr Schiefert said.
Vrchlabí travel agency can also offer Nochevija in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first forty days of February are sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stations is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to pass the end of the year on the snow-free mountain.
If the tracks remain cloudy during the week, the Christmas dates will also deteriorate," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it's a little easier to handle the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Snježkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Nochevija and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada, reported.
Eighty percent of the Nochevieja stations are already busy in the hotel Omnia, near the central parking area of Janské Lázní.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázní in Navidad the half of the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, as we found about six percent of the employment capacity.
February has been a bit weaker, but as snow falls, interest for stations in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, hotel director Omnia.
However, it seems for a moment that the hotels in Krkonoše will experience snow gain waiting for them.
Thursday should fall temperatures and, if there are precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But then again, the temperatures will rise, reports Jérí Jakubský de Hradec Kralové, of the Hydrometerological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: The repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats the question of his predecessor's strategy, which he himself took for the most difficult.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly expected, it proved that it was a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times "as in Iraq", but it also failed to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward".
He was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as a "responsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field leaders, was the only possible and successful way that today nothing is said about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left its successor a much more favorable initial situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The camp commanders again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander in chief of the operations, General Stanley McCristal. He, despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indeterminate fuses to a harsh criticism in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president was vaccinated for three months, but there was nothing better for him, so at least he lied to the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to achieve Europe's promise of another 5,000, although he himself had previously counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic of all Obama's strategy seems to be its goal, to start withdrawing from Afghanistan's troops in 18 months and completing this procedure in three years. Obama's doctrine generated more questions about the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase gives the same result as the proceeding in Iraq.
Despite the fratricated wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, and its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: nobody can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces if they are accustomed to change the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will continue to be only a people of Potemkin, after which they will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated due to the confusion, even more complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of all operations, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by its volunteerism.
During the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is about to stop.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about the reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to the war to "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, fixing the date of the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of the United States defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that Europeans are increasingly willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don't know, and they don't want to explain to their voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
Another factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect Iranians, the United States will have to make a difficult decision: trying to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers exactly when, according to Obama, America begins the withdrawal of the Afghan troops.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic revision to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that three years are missing for presidential elections and therefore there is still much time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank's directors will no longer receive the bonus in effect
The U.S. Bank's high executives Goldman Sachs will not receive the bonus this year.
The entity announced it to react to the critical nature of its wage practices.
The group of 30 high directives shall receive, rather than money, shares which cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs became the leader in an effort to unite the bonus in Wall Street with the long-term power.
I assume that Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road to take, mentioned the former investor banker of the JPMorgan Douglas Elliott company.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced the criticism after it had allocated almost $17,000 million (about $300,000 million) to the bonus in the first three trimesters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, is probably over, despite today's announced measure, $20,000 million.
The high bonus in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced the miracles that it planned to record once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonds for bankers over 25 000 pounds (about 72,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all less physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, were received today in Stockholm by King Carlos XVI Gustavo de Sweden's Nobel Prizes this year in specialized and literature categories.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also a German writer of German origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their partner Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry received the Israeli Ada Jonathan and the United States Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the fisheries.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize for Economy, was received by U.S. Elinor Ostrom and his partner Oliver Williamson for an analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a awarded woman, was Physical.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awarded received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of multiple prizes in each category, the prize is divided among themselves.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the Peace, received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of being awarded, as it is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota takes the leave. Klaus invited you to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will be given Friday morning to Minister of Agriculture Edward Janota, who is continuing his stay in the government, since he is not in agreement with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved by the House of Representatives.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps Janota's stay at the office, will be the subject of her Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the date, President Radim Ochvat informed the rapporteur.
On his stay in the function, Janato wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163,000 million crowns.
The House of Representatives, however, welcomed the proposals from the left for funds transfers and increased money for employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government is not in agreement with the proposals made by the Democrats, as they obviously increase the budgetary deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, there was a serious internal political conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucracy began to be challenged, which was agreed in spring by ODS, ČSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, is actually liquidated by the package of arrears, imposed in autumn by the Government of Fischer to prevent public debt.
Klaus may but must not sign the law on the state budget; today he stated during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had spent a lot of time challenging "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public sector.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the President said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is frightening and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucracy with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is obviously no longer working.
First Minister Fischer responded and qualified similar words of "strong judgements".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is huge, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 200,000 million crowns.
Wednesday ČSSD said that the adoption of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Inventable, reports a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that protagonists play American actors.
The history of sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The powerful fighter against the apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to interpret it in Eastwood's film.
Another important role played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When you interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of the Billion Dollar Baby box, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who had just become a slave, of the U.S. Presidential fiction, and even of God in Evan Todopoweroso. But rarely represented someone who still lives and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Inventible is a Latin word and title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henry, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation continues to be racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join the rugby players, who belong in the world's measure to the outsiders.
The South African team was able to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the movies.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as likely as possible to the reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be among the Baptists before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake his hand at Mandela.
I found out when I grabbed his hand, I got his energy, it was transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national team of rugby, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had been preparing for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar in his home.
I remember calling the door, he opened up and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "In the film I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Inventible received positive reviews and also speaks of ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film drawings on the website ruttentotoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia concluded yesterday that near the borders with Norway, it had proved a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, of the "Bulava" type, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the weight of the Russian generals and of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or an air error occurred.
In the Russian journals they write "Bulava" as "a mission that doesn't want."
A mission he doesn't want, but shines.
During this 13th test, no problem arose at first.
At the end of the flight there were further technical problems in the apparatus.
The engine was probably installed in the third phase of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which flew south into the White Sea.
This type of missile enables the launch from a ship moving and submerged at once.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failure "Bulava".
The same Norwegians from the first time did not deny that it would be a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time by saying that they can't just talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile arrived and the averaging took place in the third.
In previous cases the engines were immediately taken in the first phase.
Although none of the launchs were fully made without errors, only six of the three failed, according to the Department of Defence's management.
The success of almost fifty percent of the generals of optimism and therefore continues to say that "Bulavá" will fly one day without problems and will even be able to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the Moscow CSKA for 51 years.
The legendary advocate Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey meeting at 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and conqueror of Copa Stanley will help your team CSKA Moscow and possibly play the Friday in the KHL debt against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presided over the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash gets injured, we need another defender urgently.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, mentioned the AP agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the trainer of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the soul of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
The legend before Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of 50 and a year, during the entire period, and achieved 15 dollars and 26 assistance.
The top of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing by the Soviet Union won two Olympic gold, seven world champions, triumphed in the Canadian Cup and in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Copa Stanley twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey Glory Hall.
Hyundai has met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Exactly because of the frequent extra work, the unionists announced the rise by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vanék, the port of the Hyundai Car Factory.
The direction, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions a more Saturday tour.
We cannot refer to our production plan, as it is essential. That is why we propose additional voluntary work on Saturday, 19 December, i.e. it will work on two tournaments, Vanék said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid on Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vanęka, the company decided to change how to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can cover the bonus for extra hours or can take a day free on 28 December, i.e. extending the navies festivals one day, Vanék mentioned.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday tournaments will receive money for travel and food.
Given that the extra work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of unionists and asylum-seekers who stopped manufacturing last week, the director of the afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the additional work for December, Vanék mentioned.
The car factory employees were forced to work two hours in addition to eight hours shifts and this situation was virtually lost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another trade between the factory and trade unions should be held Monday morning.
The chief of the trade unions, Petr Kucharí, said that if the requirements were to be met and the document was signed, they were willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car factory was compounded last week by Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontaneously arrested for the frequent extra work.
They also protested against the bad conditions of payment and the alleged threat.
The Board considered that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and to be able to provide cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the rise in the rise of the moon, also demanded that none of the employees, who had interrupted last Wednesday, be penalized in some way.
With regard to additional work, trade unions require the company to reduce it at least.
In addition, this year requires a pay of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car industry in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The production in series was launched last November.
Up to last September he built about 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance to the HIV virus's 'incellated'
The team of Czech and German scientists has proved new components capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against anti-drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the composition is not so effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some medicines already available.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, patients' lives can be significantly extended through a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of HIV into the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely removed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs will no longer operate.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University shows the possibility of controlling the resistance of the virus.
They showed that the substances called metallocarbons have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of HIV.
Metalocarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all medicines used today, and thus can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, "improved" components, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
The metallocarbons have a three-dimensional structure: two polyhydrates composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are combined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and there would be no growth and infection of the virus.
If we stop HIV proteases, we also stop spreading virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemicals at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compositions, in which two pairs of jaulas (see table) are united by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A bit weaker, but more effective
The evidence of the effect of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been proven, as well as its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of enzyme is not as strong as the clinical medicinal products used, but do not lose their effect on resistant variants, where medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, that metallocarbons are relevant components for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézečova, the head of the laboratory of structural biology in the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemicals and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Academy of Sciences.
He's paying for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he's defending himself.
ODS Chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "sperous" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were marked by the prime minister as strong judgements.
They say it's time for the analysis.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucracy with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer functioning.
According to Nejas, the first minister has to decide whether the House of Representatives wants to support the minority, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the left parliament.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Representatives adopted the budget for 2010, despite the amendments made by the left, by more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased the money for government employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the ODS proposals, as they significantly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS left the room before the vote and thus fulfilled the Government's wish that the amended budget would be better than a provisional budget.
Despair and ineffectiveness
Minister of Hasienda, Edward Janota, spoke of the disappointment and feeling of worthlessness; first Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would reassess the current situation.
There is no doubt that if Janota would seriously threaten with the exemption in the event of approval of the amendments, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká television Janota, he asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, that he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is their rejection of the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer is in agreement with another fight against budgetary deficit, according to Nejas in the government, there is nothing to do with those appointed by the ČSSD, which has caused changes in the budget.
The first minister should also say clearly, if he will, if the camera approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by ODS are not guilty
This is the case of Prime Minister Fischer and all the government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, said Topolánek in U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the resident positions there are people belonging to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He once stressed that if Fischer decides to re-sign the beginning of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public doing, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported on the majority of the left hand, which is currently in the House of Members".
However, it cannot be counted with the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I didn't think about that, at any time, I'll take care of it, said to journalists in the House of Representatives, Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was specifically appointed to the government by the members of the ODS.
First Minister Fischer attended a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS sent the Prime Minister's request
He once stressed that ODS would probably vote against the amended budget if the first Minister did not explicitly ask ODS Members to accept the budget.
We do not feel like heroes, we are not small children, responded to the question, if ODS is concerned about the absence of the party's head in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize that my vote was wrong.
On the rejection of the mandate, he knew that in the coming months he would be dealt with mainly by the Bolshevikization of the House of Representatives and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new ČD train schedule, less trains will travel almost the same rates.
Českö Drahy (Ferocarriles Checos) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some fast and local trains less used and will, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by 2 per cent compared to today's, after the new train schedule is in force.
Most of the prices, including the basic and customer price, will not change.
For example, the residents of the Ostravsko region will gain more links to the capital, and drag for this line will add pendolin singlecartery.
The direct train, on the other hand, won't travel back to Bratislava.
In Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will travel less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in traffic planned by road is in the region of Hradec Kralové, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and around.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in Prague - Tábor - České Budéjovice and some fast trains in Prague - Písek - České Budéjovice will be reduced to a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysa nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esco system, around the cities, which is possible through the electrification of the Lysa nad Labem line in Milovice.
The long-distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nadraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will travel every two hours.
Travelers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino from 13 December.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport to cover the so-called demonstration losses of Drahy will receive the year that comes to four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the year that comes to pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and cheap local trains they have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been one year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will be made only in the tickets of one day - ČD Net and in the cheap internet tickets eLiška.
For guests without customer card the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLischka will depend on the distance, so far there was the only price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippines's armed forces continue to hold more than 50 people, children were placed free
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
This was confirmed by the AFP agency, who previously reported only 65 suspects.
All 17 children detained and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The drought occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say about 19 armed men use the reindeer as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining reindeer.
According to the AFP agency, the weapons belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed group of the Philippines Communist Party (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police had previously persecuted the kidnappers because of violence, which led to the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Majindano was the cause of the recent murder, in which 57 people died, the law was imposed.
Among the victims of the death on 23 November, related to the governor's elections, there were 30 journalists.
Because of the suspicion of the involvement in the killing, they arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Apatuan, a patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Apatuans.
The Islamic separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed the dialogues on Tuesday with the Philippines government.
The history of RSA refers to all over the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new film from Hollywood, Clint Eastwood Invictus (your official title in Czech isInvictus: Neporažení) was released in the United States film, which captures part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, who chose years ago for the role of protagonist Mandela himself.
The second role, the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, was interpreted by Matt Damon.
With the exception of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name was Nelson Rolihlha Mandela. It was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa there are preparations for the global football champion. The media are often disturbed by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the people by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite many reservations against the distribution of the protagonist papers by Hollywood's star "frequently interesting".
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well to play it.
Many times I found myself with Nelson Mandela, for - as it is said - spending his energy, mentioned in an interview after the festival star in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It's a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it's about the whole world, he added.
On the route of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It refers to South Africa's human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for many years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist is also taking the lead of the South African national team of rugby and entering the game field.
By entering the gramilla in the trajectory, which in RSA is considered to be almost sacred, Mandela has won large ovaries, especially the white public and the recognition of the white people for almost four years ago.
The football champion may be able to help people unite and form a nation, said the rugby Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if the stress situation in the SAA improves.
The white Africans, however, are sceptical, as he said in a recent interview for LN, an officer of rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The campaign begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has captured a transformer from the company Čeps in a fireplace near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the port of the Ustí region bomber, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, the bombers wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later they changed their opinion and the fire was excavating it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher material.
Fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's voice, the existence would not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is of several million crowns, counting it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mantátová, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity, nothing like this happened, the averies of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the voice of ČEZ for the Czech Republic, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire of electrical substation did not affect the functioning of households, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps served in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive holder of the distribution system, of the electric drive of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Stores in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the power of the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electric drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Jancura will submit a complaint by a complaint in three months from ČSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jancura today will present a complaint by slander to three social democracies.
This is the case with Michal Haszek de la region Jihomoravský, Radko Martínek de Pardubický region and El edmán de Olomouuký region Martin Tesarík.
Jancura mentioned it in twenty minutes on RadioJournal.
The demand must be seen in the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, have signed long-term contracts with České Drahy.
All three weeks are attacking us and talking about the fact that we're "taking past the pastel", but we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say we're more expensive than České dragy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dragy, which were fixed last week.
So we don't have anything else to defend.
It's for the curse towards the Student Agency society, said to RadioJournal Jancura.
He referred to the time when all regions had the evidence, and he said that they had not taken the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why an incentive is being prepared for the European Commission.
Haszek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jančira's media show, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and call on the other enemies to do the same.
I suppose that this will also clearly show that Mr Jančira has dealt with the public with the issue of rail regional transport, and uses false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Janchura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
RadioJournal told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the new year.
It was necessary that the campaign be carried out against corruption as such.
Jancura launched the campaign after the regions agreed with České Drahy to maintain regional rail links and for the task of approximately 150 billion crowns they did not call for a tender.
According to Jančira, similar steps are in conflict with the law and with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jančura claims that he has been threatened by a member of the ČSSD, because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we don't leave it, we could lose bus licences.
It was presented as a member of the ČSSD, I know what you are talking about, I am not going to say your name, Jančira said today for RadioJournal.
The neumoccal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The neomococal vaccine from January will end the usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against neuroscientists stop.
The Medicines Institute is already fixing the maximum prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free holidays for children born in August
From January, children born from 2 August of last year will be free of charge.
The condition is that no dose of the vaccine has been received before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before, should also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine should be received between the third and fifth months of age of the child.
Last year the fourth part of the families voluntarily left their children to be vaccinated against neomocotes.
However, the parents paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
For the youngest children, four doses are required.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without delay, they will be stored in treatment, which is necessary for non-vaccinated children.
The state has so far spent the entire vaccination of children about 500 thousand a year.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Neumocococo is the cause of the average otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
Of the neo-ococcal infections in our country every year, according to research in 28 non-age children in the hospitals.
In addition to Chequia, the neo-ococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, once there are opinions, this vaccine may be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civil association Nahlas.
Its association has been promoting neo-ococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, where our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we had the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to start now, Kalovskiy mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against neomocotes.
At this point we don't think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršön.
The volunteer vaccine has its disadvantages, the doctors say.
La President de la Sociedad de pediatras Family of Practical Child Doctors Hana Cabrnoch's recognition, which the Vacuna volunteers have about desvetations.
If all children receive the vaccine, you may reason on reducing the number of doses. "In the situation where the vaccine costs so much, we understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as voluntary," said Cabrnochová.
Experts hope that from the year over 80 percent of young parents will leave their babies to take their baby.
The neumoccal vaccine is also a major change because, as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prevention, to save later in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, the pediatras are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, as when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "relief the money of health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that the pediatrics will invest in the 40 thousand vaccines per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of stealing drawings worth 20 million United States dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while carrying 90 pictures in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and other men used an excavator to jump into the museum, in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan el Barbaro and Tarzán.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told the police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a deposit".
The agency said Frazetta Father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends the increase in taxes in the budget
Ministers have defended the increase in taxes and cuts in the previous report to the budget, in the face of the criticism of opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "loss" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the shortcoming of the deficit, delaying the decisions until after the elections.
The ministers of Hacienda also received severe criticisms to harm low- and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a rise of 0.5% in social security spending and a peak of 1% in public sector wage agreements since 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
The unions have complained that low-paid workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems".
The increase in the cost of social security, which will increase around three billion pounds per year, has inspired the business community, which states that this is a tax on employment, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
CLASSIFICATION FOR SUPPLY
Social security with an additional 0.5% rise from April 2011
The economy will take more than 4.75% this year
New 50 % tax on bankers' profits
The rise of 1 point tax on small firms has been abolished
Tax damages for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2,5 %
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Justice, a person who wins £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who wins £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who wins £10,000 per year will win £ 110.
The ministers said that their objective of reducing the deficit for 2013 meant "hard decisions", but stressed that 60 per cent of the additional tax burden would fall on 5 per cent of the highest wage.
The Minister of Hacienda, Stephen Timms, denied that the tax increases and the cuts of delineated costs were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared with what was needed.
"These are large figures, which will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," the BBC told him.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the pronoses of the Labour Party regarding future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be paid and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance has been obliged to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4,75% this year, much worse than the decrease of 3,5% predicted in April, while the claim for loans would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Sustained opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the labour party, said that the projection of claims for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how the money would be returned, adding, "synically" to the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shade of the Ministry of Hacienda, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have lost it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, whoever wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, in contrast with conservative proposals, which will seek to reduce the deficit in a shorter period of time.
But the liberal Democrats said that the money collected by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support the next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were as "arena castles".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in the inflation of some subsidies due to the inability of the next month, mentioned earlier, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to electoral charges, as money could simply be recovered in the following year.
However, the working party insists that the most needed people are being provided and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish the post-2011 cost data, the economists said that it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the Ministry of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, possibly including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really exaggerating the pain for further," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant of Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets take this into account."
The FBI is referring to "U.S. arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five U.S. suspects of extremist connections.
Pakistan's embassies told the BBC that the men were detained in a meeting at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they were the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A., last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that he was also looking for information on men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egypt's heritage and the other of Yemen's origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are going to be very interested in the tasks which have been held and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman, Katherine Schweit, said that the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their business there, if they are actually the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the presence of the local police and that there had been no charges against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency; but he said that the United States had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in Virginia, North, by the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran have always been the same in the last 20 years, according to a report from the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the patterns of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man quoted in the report said they had hit him and burned him with cigarettes, another said they threatened him with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its history of human rights.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of arrests and dozens of deaths in Iran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked major street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Hundreds of people have been convicted, and the prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the senior leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamei, recognized some abuse charges, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, according to our correspondence.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report by Ibrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and they left him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semiconscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some demonstrators detained after the election had been tortured until death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of an ex-container, who claimed that he was detained in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the maladies of the post-election and the Government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the aerugations of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski track was held in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol interest site into a competition track.
The track at the Park event drew 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for prizes in effect.
At the top of the pendant in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump lamp, facing a 100-metre track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year-old medical student, said he had a beautiful view since the track's funeral, but it was quite impressive.
A beautiful view of the city's lights is seen below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
Awards were awarded to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be stopped.
Still them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico State.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested that mineral construction be prohibited and that there is a general warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most widely open societies in the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the latest work of the author "Why the French don't like the blind" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that has divided and cared for the country for a decade and a half, and its effects are still seen today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what really is happening.
It's been months in méchits, schools and institutes that now provide 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener that plays discussions between teachers and students on questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mixet or in a union (or both)?
Should young Muslims teach them about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it lawful for a Muslim to use a banking system based on interest in obtaining a mortgage?
These are apparently global issues, they support, things of everyday life, those that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of iimaes, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renouncing, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab academic and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern lay society.
This argument cannot be fully disseminated.
Conservatives question only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with his Salafi homologists, supporters of the Puritan Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French lacyism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It asks how far the French political strategies (and the intellectual elite so strongly defends layism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to have a more unjust treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to Latin republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it sees "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most dissolute panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramaticly than any other habit of the planet.
The ice that defines it is approaching a alarming speed, bringing with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustration, paints a natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Knowledge of the complicated history and policy of the whale hunt, describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable evidence to face the same white.
The meeting of Almirante Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old chain, struggling only with the extremes of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The creatures, captured while they were born following the bodies of their recent mothers, were captured and sent to zoologists and circuses.
A round presentation at the beginning of the 20th century, presented 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even at present, zoologists still are generally a millionth of the area of an adult village. The climate is almost never suitable: a huge polar resident in Singapore is green by the algae that grow within the areas without its wings.

They resort to stories from other writers and historians, and often return to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and schizophrenia in motor vehicles use high-powered rifles to reach their targets.
Ironically, it is in the waters toward the north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scalable story about the science of the Arctic and an overcrowded viewer about how to transform the future of that place.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not because of a lack of effort.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen toward the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century gave indications for the first time about the movement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War Submarines drew a map of the moving ice chains that circled under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and the extensive series of probes mounted in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals caught in cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looked inside the extraordinary, lower world of the afluent system inside the Arctic ice, formed by salt water pipes that are compressed while freezing.
But from the oasis on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to occur sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington's drums
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crown in the tomb of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery for the Decorating of Tambas, it was a day for men and women who were once on foot in their boats.
In a few months, from where they're aboard us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, so just try to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the veterans' drums in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morris Worcester, owner of the Coronas Worcester Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and other people decided to rent several hundred drums in the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is a 18-year-old tradition, Morris and his wife Karen travel every year by stopping in different cities along the road, to serve events dedicated to the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Cross America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the rooms of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagono, in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Batteries Park in New York City, and in the memorial site of the 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a lost military career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to pay back those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Roofed in warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the wide beaches and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older drums of World War I, Second World War, and Vietnam's war, because they did not receive as many visits as the new drums, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was happy while the children were playing and the couple took their hands, carrying the fresh pine to the burial stone.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red sheet attached to the top.
Nearly there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are hidden, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (United Nations Military Association) provided 1,000 crowns to decoration the section, but the summer atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read in a loud voice some names hidden in the stones, while others turned to see small white and black plates placed inside the moving bar, for those whose stones have not yet been filled.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who were stabbed in the tears of her eyes in front of her son's grave.
I managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Sgto Marine Artillery Tower. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Very much after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban Government has detained a contractor from the US government who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, the officials of the Department of State stated on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company works in client projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
The consular officers, together with the United States Interests Section in Lebanon, are seeking access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be held for almost anything considered "of danger".
All counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, constitute the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an initial blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and arrested by government officials.
Sanchez has requested several opportunities to leave the country to accept awards, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor may probably cause tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the administration of Obama, who has been looking for a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to introduce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban Government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity by the United States.
Mobiles and portable computers are legal in Cuba, although they are new products and codified in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors from the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of a United States in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the United States Interests Section in Lebanon, said that most of the U.S. citizens' imprisonment in Cuba is between crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly detached.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the American programme of Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, itself Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as the country's leader, to replace his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often detained, processed and imprisoned in one day.
It pointed out that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries start having more dialogue.
Pakistani officials design a deal to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, expressing their hope that the case could help to design an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who are using the Internet in search of young radicalized people.
Researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site.
Saifullah addressed men once in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal capital, which is a family place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed of the case showed on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince Qaeda's commanders that men were not part of a CIA team to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they have been isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargotha, far from the mountainous regions of the northeast, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of an operation covered.
For this reason they were rejected, said the officer, who spoke from the anonymous due to the delicacy of the case.
The officer said that the men were not moving and were even trying to obtain the appropriate approval to access the Qaeda camps when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of five men, who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI, highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more important, determines who are trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. intelligence has been a major priority in attempting to infiltrate people within Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, not allowing those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda was particularly attentive to the aspirant American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to their potential to have access to US goals and their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who accept it, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model than they have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has been transformed into a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demands climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of exhibitors walked here on the streets requiring merchants to work at the Bella Center Convention Centre in the city, more decent actions for the climate.
The protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police believed that the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a bunch of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On a day when little was happening in the United Nations climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city with pankarts in English saying "There's no planet B" and one in Spanish saying, "The Earth says "yes."
Several famous people joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, made me aware of the disturbing issues that the country must deal with due to the impacts of the climate change that are already taking place."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and to appeal to world leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but if you have to do, there's no way to get rid of it for more time.
The police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or because they were carrying bottles.
According to the Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who was asked not to be identified by being involved in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black actions placed several explosives near Copenhagen's main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as calls, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to enter into the conscience of key officials such as Su Wei, China's head of climate negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't so much of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarín, "As the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that he depended on the perspective of each person to determine whether the course was harmful or beneficial.
He said that this showed public attention in general and from different sectors to the topic of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that negotiations, or the freedom of other people, affect them.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences
The Federal Book of Qualifications last week on the performance in mathematics was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performing systems, the book of qualifications showed that the students of the fourth and eighth grade gave a faster rate over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the constant difference in performance between African students and white students at both local and national levels.
The average score of the D.C.'s fourth grade white students over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African parents only increased from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially stable, lowering a statistically significant point from 245 to 244.
The average white score was not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black students in 2003 when the first ENPE in the District was introduced was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although the score achieved by children in both groups has increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the progress made by Rector Michelle A. The Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrata) were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not giving leaps of joy for a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, a critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test score is that secondary schools in the city have an unexpected need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see positive signs, and I respect them.
But what concerns us is that we are not devoting neither the time nor the energy needed for our secondary schools.
Rhee said that the District needed to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, is training some teachers to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which is directed to students of higher levels of primary and secondary school, who have not dominated early reading bases in their school courses and are significantly behind their parents.
The maths of every day, a math curriculum from Kindergarten to Six degree, which highlights real life games and experiences, which were introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, to which some of the progress reported by ENPE last week was believed.
I just think we need to continue working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level, Rhee said.
Others say that the EPPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and thus provide additional money and resources for low-income schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here there is a kind of scaffolding dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of California in Berkeley, who studied urban trials.
The solution to the conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the objective can generate political impacts that are countering that important chronology.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she is trying to stick to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now presiding in Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end performance differences is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It must take nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, that he reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year of 185 days, which he considered to be a "indicator" to seek greater increase in the next convention.
Make higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and separated for a moment from the white columns, the ladrills and the smeral grasses.
Graciela's parents had just graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Not long ago, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot in a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eight-grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the matrix cost $38,690 a year, their attitude was less than the impressive guests of potential student enthusiasm.
Yes! Here is where I will be! Graciela exclaimed, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the scientific building.
Carey, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of teachers and students in school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their trip for three days, and had already absorbed fully their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to university.
The question is what.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who leave secondary school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who attend university education that they need to access to the middle class.
In fact, one of the five of these Spanish "second generation" graduated from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing secondary school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze the highest performance say that they often have a natural fitness for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of family ties with American schools.
But care programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, especially if efforts are being sustained in time.
Noting children with low income, whose parents have no experience and skills to help them navigate through the system, it is clear that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from the childhood garden to the secondary school.
The federal program that financed the race by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually to local school systems to implement university preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in high school and continue to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Ministry of Petroleo Iraq achieves agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government was able to attract important oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure during two subsidized Saturdays.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleo with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play a key role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, multiplied by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies have been denied only two of the 10 subsidized yachts.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second Saturday, which began Friday.
The only thing that presented a offer was lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for subsidized hunting in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, a online news center.
It will take a long time before something else is available in Iraq.
The security concerns, fueled by massive mass-coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while US military retreated, probably prevented US oil companies from becoming more energetic in Iraq, which had the third most important global reserve, the analysts said.
In some cases, U.S. companies were in decline, because rivalries, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main American signatures, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have bound ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have been abandoned with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two main yachts.
We know that China is on its way to become a major economic and technological power, the spokesman of the Ministry of Petroleo Assam Jihad showed.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the heart of its competitors and will meet its commitments towards Iraq.
The companies selected to submit proposals made bids that were then faced with the barrier subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each landing.
Qaeda's main planner has been apparently killed in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged US missile attack at Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a major planner of operations in Qaeda this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second fatal attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somalí was one of the two Arab men who was thought to have failed Tuesday when a couple of missiles attacked his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of Waziristan in the North, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal territory of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, headed to the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an officer of Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspected local military personnel were rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what had been left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecific evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner in Qaeda, which led the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was committed to conspiracy around the world, said a high official, who spoke from the anonymous, citing the delicate nature of the US air attacks within the Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the upper command of Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. officer said Somalia had climbed rapidly in the Qaeda lines and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but it does not at all diminish the threat it posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military force in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The rate of unmanned aircraft attacks directed by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to The Long War Journal account, a website directed by a non-profit organization.
The reduction may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while suddenly killing suspect informants, the site stated.
UN maximum sent to Kabul to cancel
The largest United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would give up his post in March, ending with a silent mandate that was damaged by allegations of corruption in the presidential election of Afghanistan supported by the United Nations.
Eide's exit occurs when Obama's administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that it supported the increase, but he was concerned that the U.S. cronograph for the military withdrawal that began in 18 months prompted other NATO Governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide pointed to a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel, who collaborated with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not leaving, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said I would like to notify the Secretary.
General of UN Ban Ki-moon, so it would take time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide showed.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's exit and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously conducted UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegation, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide refused the crimes, but he said that Galbraith's allegations, who was dismissed, "were certainly damaging the mission, because there had already been a lot of scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States forces in Afghanistan.
It also urged the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which are being awarded to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase his confidence in the proper use of his money.
Eide expressed frustration over its limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the strict United Nations procurement regulations reduced its ability to capture talents.
That is how the United Nations rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and can't continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Defence Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "a significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because of its failure to negotiate their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, headed to a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week's journey in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There were no good options in Iran, I supported, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such a incident.
One of my concerns is that, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inexhaustibleness of war.
The administration of Obama is considering a package of sanctions directed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the general Iranian population.
I argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and derogations", "to convince the Iranian government that they would be really less safe with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "reliable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the instructions of the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
They will insist that he wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would again negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would accept to leave a substantial part of its enriched uranium reserve instead of the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has stressed that agreement as a means of building confidence between the two parties and making time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has seemed to have been away from the temptation agreements, in part experts have claimed, because Iran's command is divided in relation to the possibility of compromise with the United States.
I believe, frankly, that Iran's endurance with the international community on some of the proposals that were actually accepted at the beginning of October has joined the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of additional significant sanctions against the Iranians, expressed Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options are reconsidered, even to continue with what Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "dangerous sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what the youth called "inconsistency and lack of ground" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said he was willing to continue negotiations with the United States and five other world powers, "to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was about to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurd region of Iraq rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurds in Irbil.
The tension continues to rise between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in the United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We won't leave them."
In an elderly China, a change of course
Wang Wejiia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda cards that they spoke to them about the fact that "the Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means a more tube."
They learned the lesson so well that when officials of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the elderly population of their city, suddenly changed from this summer to encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was immediate and firm: in no way.
We've given all our time and energy to a child only.
We have nothing left for a second, says 31-year-old Wang, a human resource administrator with a 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notoriously wealthy children, the only unwritten children, lovingly supported by "small emperors", is a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen by 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six times when politics was effective, according to the Division.
The United Nations demographic, while it is expected that the population of 60 years of age and more will operate from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050, which is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with very cult populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Family Planning Commission and the Municipal Population Commission of Shanghai, has shown that fertilization couples should have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of the elderly population and to reduce a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
As part of the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single child in China may be the most Polish mandate introduced up to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face enormous difficulties, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have assessed the policy for their contribution to avoid a critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in policy taxation.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the foe, leading to a high natural proportion of male male and female.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually reduced their position on the policy of the only child.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife are the only children, and in 2007 many of their hard-line clothing were maintained.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research of the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost midnight in the morning, the cartels that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations that described who would be suitable for having a second child and how to ask for permission.
The city's government sent family planning officers and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and tear down booklets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very short-lived.
Disgusting Response
Although rural officials in the Shaghai villages maintain that they have observed a moderate increase in couples' requests that want a second child after the campaign is launched, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai's disappointed officials say that despite the campaign, it is still expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 is only around 165,000 slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the city of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They wanted to give him the best of their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, of 26, said they would like to have two children and are legally able to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the medical and life insurance that the government provides.
Without a social protection network, they maintain that option would be irresponsible.
The people in the West see wrong the policy of the only child as a question of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yes, they're stealing us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples mention psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource administrator, said he wants a single child because she was also the one: "We were the center of our families and we were accustomed to all taking care of us.
We are not accustomed to caring for others and we really do not want to care for others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more consistently.
For parents with two careers, of the middle class, which reduces the birth rate, he said, it is an attempt to have enough success as to be self-employed.
People between 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents fight during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even one child needs a lot of time from the parents, I insisted.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "you have to remodel your apartment," and the strategy "you have to have a course prepared for the best guards when the child is 9 months old."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Our first generation with the highest standard of living, it showed.
We don't want to make too much sacrifices.
A UN group sets out a plan to reduce emissions
The UN conference on climate-spatialized climate, which has so far been characterized by depleting and mutual crimes, has drawn renewed attention to Friday with the publication of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that carry most of the load on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the path to follow.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiations that is being held without time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
A United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not speak of how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to deal with global warming in a short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives you a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited the document on six pages, summarized a negotiating text of 180 pages to focus on what the UN's largest climate officer, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama."
Displays profiles for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would collectively record their emissions for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the discussions on Friday, promising to provide $3,600 million annually over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday presented the same kind of verbal artificial fires that dominated the conversations last week.
The United States Special Climate Letter, Todd Stern, rejected the claims requesting mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared with the volunteers of the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The manobra indicated that the Obama administration was adopting a stronger line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without the major developing countries making progress and taking measures, Stern said, who also complained that the text had not done enough to ensure that the records could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of China He Yafei said that the U.S. climate negotiator was missing "common seat", or was "very irresponsible" because he had said earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers in play, failure lines have been eliminated both inside the world in development ways, as well as between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-fourth world's most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most valid action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were discussing who should spend the cost of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, even when vulnerable countries became more aggressive seeking to contain large-scale operators of their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, supported by Ulate, who also works as a regional council on climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants said that the talks would produce a political agreement at the same time.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, prepared a preliminary 24-page treaty proposal tomorrow morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, who is leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "meditated political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now unified and demand action by emerging economies, such as China and India.
The discussions took a new urgency while delegations focused on the fact that most of the issues had to be resolved except before the Heads of Government had arrived at the conclusion of a treaty.
High-level officials, such as Minister of the Indian Environment Jairam Ramesh and Deputy Chinese Minister, came from the planes and ran to the streets of Bella Center, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, to be able to delimitate the allegations that will be dealt with in the next week.
The absolute decline of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention centre each day), activists who touch the guitar present night shows burning from the countries they claim to be selling, and preliminary proposals are made by hand instead of by mail), posed a challenge.
The intensity is only built: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and the poor 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the larger links, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President for the Global Policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train 225 km from Great Britain re-definitions this feeling of the moon
On the 5.13th of the month in the morning, a shilling will provide darkness to signal a train exit marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed interurban train in the country will reach 225 kmh, when it passes like a radio from Ashford, Kent, at the St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
At Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then join Ms. Kelly Holmes, on the front of the first interurban Javelin service outside London.
He hopes that the new service finally connects Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connects the great rounds of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Disadvantaged areas would be turned into surrogate progress, business times would be reduced and the change in aircraft and railway cars would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as facilitate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But tens of thousands of millions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fear of environmental damage can still break the high-speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will submit its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide a detailed router from the next scheduled stage for the high-speed network.
The new line that a London to the Middle East will be drawn within a five-metre radio in urban areas and areas where environmental impact can be polar.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 sets three options for a wider high-speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is an Y-shaped configuration, where a single high-speed line would reach the Middles of the West.
The line would be divided into or close to Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the north to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle up to Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, the travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced by 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first step, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a little more than an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 kmh, converting to the British network in the fastest way in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support 400 mt trains, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit into the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only St Pancras International or Euston stations offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should be carried out, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on the roads in north Birmingham, maintaining the travel times between London and Scotland over the three hours.
This is considered to be the crucial point needed to ensure a change in trains, a reference point for railway revolution.
Contributors face the mortgage for a £75,000 orange from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the voice of the Conservative Party, spent thousands of pounds a year on the cost of a naranjal that he built at the home of his electoral district.
The party's prison voice, which was degraded by David Cameron to complain that the MPs lived "for reasons", increased their mortgage at £75,000 to build a stock-marked extension in their second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge additional interest to the contributor, paying hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at its time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the costs of members. Yesterday Mr. Duncan said that the applications could not be clearer or simpler.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, has a house of two floors in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The floor floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year a winter added to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal".
Neighbors described it as "a winter for entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the Committee decided to violate the rules after an investigation of its costs.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds of his property in London at the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the previous year to become a member.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 monthly pounds for hypothetical interests until March last year.
In April, its applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that all increase would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable hypothetical type of BRE was 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March this year, the type that is now found.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1.250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after a buried reporter filmed him saying that the MPs had to survive "reasons" after the cost scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live for reasons and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money on my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask much more, but I don't do it."
The Member, a millionaire for his former profession as a oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May when he found out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the wage office that this "may be considered excessive".
An activist sought an agrier in the form of the symbol of the esterlin book in Mr. Duncan's head as a protest, after it was discovered that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Yesterday, when he was asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, approved by both the wage office and then Legg."
He added: "It is not about exorcising and criminalizing or infringinging the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
I couldn't be in any clearer or simpler way."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Brighton Beach Palace Event
Brighton's palals have found a new impetus for winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that facilitates spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorated their words for every day of December, using villas as their theme.
The event started on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palace from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with full pastel and free serving ponche.
The selected villas so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palace presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated clergy of the diocese of Chichester and Beyond's leader.
He said, "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect us as Church that people come to an old foreign building? I think that the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Pala's Event began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrating place and we are trying to prove and represent it through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and the whole world
Tens of thousands of demonstrators protested this Saturday on an ambitious and binding agreement to combat global warming, throughout the world and Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, were represented by the Danish capital in a complaint that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should be reached by Friday, January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization throughout the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents took place shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all black clothes, broke off their escapes with Adokins and martils, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbants police intervene quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 persons in total, according to it, especially members of the Black Blocks, additional violent groups that had already been active during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April last.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, complained of the conditions in which hundreds of soldiers were detained “without distinctions”, stressing that a hundred of them were “immotivated on the street by the night of married and sat in spite of the cold.”
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the White Center, the seat of the negotiations.
The exhibitors stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to accommodate the invited speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, was headed by a guard with wings.
Most of the protesters came by car and train from the great European cities, but many Asians, among them Chinese and Korean, were also present, like some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with heavenly showerers responded by setting up a first concentration for the morning in Copenhagen at the Calling of Friends of the Earth to form "Azules Seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the steps to request compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Philippinesi military officer of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: there was a time, said the well-being singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, watercourses that can be walked as never had been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement was close to the ecological organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalization figure, explained that I came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not against the fight across the world".
The Pacific region, which combines many highly vulnerable islands to heat, gave the initial score of events.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went off the road in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, in most of their students, were dressed in red clothes and lighting clothes for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters claimed to act energetically against climate change.
In France, the exhibitions organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (Sur), Lille (Northe), Burdeos (Ost) and Lyon (Est).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
Abjasia separatist elected president, although Georgia complained "fraud"
This sabbath of Abjasia, a prologue separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow over a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi complained "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgia war in August 2008 by the South Ossetia control, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Elections closed at 17 hours of GMT.
According to the representatives of the Abyesia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closing.
The first interim results would be announced on Saturday night at Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, have categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, which has rejected the exclusive vote.
These elections are a joke.
On the other hand, Georgian President Micheël Saakachvili, "laughs that Abjasia has fallen under the full Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it an illegal part of Georgia occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempted to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new being as an independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who said he had voted in Bagapch.
She was among the voters who headed to the electoral table in a capital school, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees in the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with rich landscapes, across the Black Sea.
Large tables show Bagapch on the side of the president and first Russian minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different locations in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, West of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of estrution.
In a short ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank the support of Moscow, and particularly the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by raising his vodka vessel.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that granted Russia control over the railways occupied for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, in alertness, arrested more than 700 people around an impeccable demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, died early in the cold of the Danish capital, which was received by the delegates from 193 countries on 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and went to the White Center, where negotiations are being developed.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to accommodate the invited speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, was headed by a guard with wings.
Several moments after the show started, a group of hundreds of people, all black clothes, broke off their luggage with ladrills and martils, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbants police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, pulling the floor to several of them.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 persons, stating that they were mainly members of the Black Blocks, ultraviolet groups that had already taken place at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April last.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the mandibule with an addoquin, and four cars were burned near a house occupied during the incidents that led to the arrest of 20 people, according to the police.
To the extremist groups we did not remove their eyes from above, they warned the police officer Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces overflew the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived on the road and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, including Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, among them Chinese and Korean, were also present as some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with heavenly showerers responded by setting up a first concentration for the morning in Copenhagen at the Calling of Friends of the Earth to form "Azules Seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the steps to request compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Philippinesi military officer of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, said to the AFP that came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not against the fight across the world".
The Oxfam organization together with the former UN refugee commission, Mary Robinson, who was supposed to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrations, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific region, which combines many highly vulnerable islands to heat, gave the initial score of events.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people were on their way to Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, in most of their students, showed red clothes and shining garments in favour of solar energy in front of the Philippines capital's Association.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters claimed to act against climate change were formed.
In France, the exhibitions organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (Sur), Lille (Northe), Burdeos (Ost) and Lyon (Est).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
The assignment of history and geography is strengthened by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister for National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview to be transmitted to the Information on Sunday (JDD, according to his French seal) that history and geography would "strengthen" the reform of secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachilerate.
From now on, all first-time school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "even with hypocrisy," he said, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch," but "generally, it calls for the best students."
The branches of General and Literary Education can not be sub-primeals of the C, it goes on to emphasize: "I also hear that historians or intellectuals have been upset by eradicating history and geography in secondary bachilerate in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French of ten (69%) rejected the government project to eliminate mandatory history-geographical education according to batillerate C. Intelligent and teachers, the left and some right elected representatives also criticized this fact.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not to speak" to eliminate the philosophy of the programme of secondary Bachelor C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a movement day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give an admission test for the purpose of their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real terms during the M2 year, then they will be the first year in front of the school as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the school, i.e., over 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
In the Upper Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain with conviction the evolution of the climate
Five minutes to discuss the challenges of Copenhagen's summit, a challenge that he accepted the Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Upper Normal School of the Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, opened the "Ernest" conference hall, a day consisting of a series of five-minute, filmed and open presentations to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and sent them to learn more, explained in the framework of the Edouard Hannezzo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day, as the students were baptized at school's stake.
We chose some twenty participants among the experts of your discipline and selected them on your charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who was exposed without notes, but with the help of graphs against 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on a very serious scientific expedition".
Videos filmed at those conferences will be online on the school's website since December 15.
It is scheduled for February the next "Ernest" day, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delay in payments: discomfort between prison guards, plans to take action
Prison guard unions called on Friday a "general mobilization" to require payment before the end of the year, the premiums and extra hours, which were postponed to the core of budgetary reasons.
The Prison Labour Force (2nd guard union) asked staff outside of service to join the demonstration tomorrow morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to declare the theft of their possessions.
The Penitentiary CGT (3rd trade union) calls on them to " meet in general assemblies in different prisons to achieve massive mobilization", as it is slow to "unacceptable" the failure of payment in December of "extraordinary hours, nighttimes, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first security union, the Federal Autonomous Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls on general mobilization (...) with a view to increasing satisfaction and anger".
The Department of Criminal Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that extra hours increased significantly in 2009 and not all were counted, but they ensure that the balance will be entered in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the security unions to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
No doubt of the staff's efforts for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
Requests the Office of the Criminal Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to prevent this situation from being re-produced in the future by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours.
The December payment will then be short, except for staff of the director who enjoys the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and that "always blames the budgetary requirements," Ufap/Unsa said.
It is a real scandal, he said outraged the interregional FO of Marsella, announcing his decision to book up to a new order "all meetings and calls".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and holidays, if the month of October is not paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As the tasks and missions increase, without taking more effective action, it is more painful to be forced to attack staff's wages, which is estimated by the Burdeos Prisoner CGT.
According to the unions, not all regions have the same experience, as some have more success than others.
But anyway, the result is not expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about the gifts: "I do better gifts than those I receive."
During a special interview the ABC will issue Sunday night, the President and his wife, Michelle, explain how they think they will celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small four-step family partner, will be from the game.
Father Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, explaining that the dog will, of course, receive a gift, according to the extracts of the programme transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama discussed with her husband's statements about the quality of gifts she receives: "In no way, last year she made you beautiful gifts," she urged the president.
True, if I saw him being forced to admit before answering with humor, pointing at the hair-crowding of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?"
During an hour's interview, in a separate environment with the famous animator who loyally supported the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite gifts of childhood.
Barack Obama recalled a bike with two speeds, as well as a basketball ball that his Kenyan father, who saw rarely, gave him to Navida.
I remember that time when my father came to see us in Navidad and gave me a basketball ball, the President said.
Just a few years later, I understand that he had given me that balloon.
On his side, the First lady remembered her house of moustaches.
I had no idea how to organize a house, then put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of resting them around the house, however, I worshipped that house of ants, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday newly operated, RTL says it's inducted
Johnny Hallyday was re-intervention in Los Angeles due to important "Lesions" arising from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its annexes, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Thursday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where some doctors checked "Lesions arising from the operation" of dyscal hernia performed in Paris on 26 November, he pointed out his press service in the same city, indicating that these injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the author's press service tried to transmit silence by stating that the situation was "under control", and informed that a new medical part would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to the RTL, the singer's last tour patron Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "knocks and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient dies, we will be more sure about his condition, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" would not have been introduced any channel after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operating at the international clinic of Parque Monceau due to a dyscal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
The singer Johnny Hollyday entered the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection caused by the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained the Thursday in RTL that his friend was through "a bad time", but he made sure he didn't make "no problem" because rocker is "a fighter".
He just called me before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a ton of flying twelve hours after the same operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the music producer, Jean-Claude Camus, threatened to calm down by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted successfully to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken with Laeticia, the wife of the music, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was admitted for nine days to cause a fall in his jacket.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated by a "colon cancer", after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer withdrew, as it was planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his diaspora.
But since then, every health problem has gone too far. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the music to move into the scene.
By mid-November, their allies had, even, demented a new international.
Euro-2009/Speech: first title of Bousquet in its favourite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-dimensionalist in the 2009 Worldly Large pool, received an international title on Thursday at a distance from which it feels particularly loving, 50 m free, during the Euro-2009 short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Veraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russians with 4 x 50 m 4 styles (masculin).
A penalty for Bousquet, which codifies the world record in 50 m free, marks it in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two Kingdoms of the birth, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was forced by 20'53 during a final where ten nadators competed instead of eight as usual, an international primacy.
Bousquet progressed to the Duje Draganja Croatian (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but did not achieve the global brand (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always hope for something better and, in that case, I have already said that if the world record was at my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the fans wore polyurethane bathers that will be banned from January 1.
These bathers, from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epipedia in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help German Paul Biedermann, a double world pool camp this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young narrator was unable to lower its mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give me my back in this race.
I knew I wasn't going to be able to beat a world record this time, but I was able to defend my title and perform my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.A.: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art march.
This 2 meters long for 63 cm high, date from the third century after Christ, and its price was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dynamic scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satiries and Hebrew women, is a little common part, since there are only four or five in the world," explained the Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the Art Subsists of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred pieces.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most promoted by the buyers, no doubt, signaled to the AFP a porter of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, and later appeared in the home of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as part of his own Parisian special mission, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before the Seaman Petain took power.
For some 50 years, his paradise was inconceivable.
By reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola follow-up" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the freshness of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras abolished Zelaya's exit to Mexico
The Mexican Jew thought that the conditions were not given to transfer to his territory to the vice president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the Golpista government denied the rescue.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation last night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
The plane from the Mexican government that arrived at El Salvador to take it back to Zelaya, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to give her a life sentence, the golpist government wanted to force Zelaya to "break up" and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the dismissed president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as Head of State in an invited exercise.
The golpist government "has suffered a new defeat by asking me to give up my job (...), they would like to present my resignation," Zelaya said on Radio Globo, in which she often makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that took five months in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, added the president of the depositary, who has been refugees in the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassies presented us with a request for asylum, but unfortunately we could not accept it because we did not have an asylum application, the Minister of the Interior of the Golpista Government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told the Hungarian radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's party moved the Wednesday to the supporters of the vice president, who met around Brazil's embassies, strongly seated by the military.
The Brazilian Minister for External Relations, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the Golpist government.
This reflects the marginal character of this Government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was dismissed on 28 June on the day when he had organized a referendum to prepare his election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and fled to Brazil's embassies.
If he does, he will be arrested and must answer to the Justice for the crime of "high-trading", according to the golpist government.
In fact, the president, Roberto Micheletti, was able to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the ecrutinian Polynesia, he elected Porfirio Lobo. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until it completed its mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street up, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Bolsa closed this Thursday, the figures of the U.S. trade balance are a faithful witness to the economic recovery of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67 per cent; and Nasdaq, 0.33 per cent.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, a technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The enlarged standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, Lindsey Piegza de FTN Financial said.
But this is anecdotic, he explained, considering that the market was concentrated "in the middle of the valley".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which reflected an improvement in activity in the quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, at $32,900 million.
Analysts, on the contrary, looked forward to deepening the deficit.
Imports and exports increased.
Great innovation is the growth of the volumes of trade exchanges, in particular the exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, comments Christopher Cornell, of the Economic.com research company.
On the other hand, during the past week, unemployment rates in the United States increased unexpectedly, and 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the last four weeks, the average of the number of new employment applicants "was the lowest since a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year-old ten-year-old bonus income rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night, and from 30-year-olds to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on Friday.
Cuba: more than a hundred members of the power are serving the "Damas de Blanco"
This Thursday's hundreds of Cuban forces beat the wives of political prisoners gathered in La Habana for the World Day of Human Rights and prevented another demonstration to which a decade of dissidents were summoned.
Forty "Damas de Blanco," wives or family members of political prisoners, were arrested on the street by supporters of the government of Raúl Castro as they headed to the capital center claiming the release of those detained, supported a journalist from the AFP.
Kill the Yanquis!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" ran high with the guns of the military of power to the dissidents.
These last were chosen by civil servants who came to "protect them".
The evening, a similar demonstration against the "Blanco Ladies" in La Habana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the village of Vedado, a decade of dissidents who also attended the show on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights, was arrested by civil-made police officers, reported an AFP journalist.
The agents were forced to drive vehicles to the dissidents who were abused by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents under similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
The "Damas de Blanco" that the Sajarov Prize 2005 granted by the European Parliament had organized an unauthorized march to "solicit the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissident, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities accuse the opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" on behalf of their declared enemy, the United States.
In the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of the government's soldiers' juves against the "controversials".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An imaginary killer to an octogene with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man out of balance with two shoes killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the time of the greatest tomorrow's riot.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressive would have been hit with two bullets and for reasons not yet determined, to an elder, in the pharmacovigilance or face-to-face in No. 85 of Jean-Jaurès, reported police sources and witnesses.
Because of serious injuries, the man who was born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police union officer Alliance.
Then in the pharmacovigilance or face it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her husband.
The husband, for about 30 years, was interrupted and wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man fell.
The life of the other victim, with the apparently affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a dementia and was admitted "in shock state", a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by bulvar Jean Jaurès.
Apparently, he would have hurt two more petons: a man of thirty years, and another of forty seriously.
By night, the scene of the crime was still unexplained.
He was armed with two meat bags that had been crossed in the back, explained at the place a leader of the Alliance union in the Highs of the Senate, Arnaud Pressé.
Several survivors, including young people, tried to control the fraud, according to the testimony received by the AFP.
I've seen a kind of thirty-year-old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get it because the guy was strong, explains Alberto, a neighbor's roommate.
A crowd chased him up, among them a police officer who broke the wall, added.
By bulvar Jean-Jaurès, at the time of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded in prisons, according to the police evidence.
The facts were produced in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main arteries, where numerous stores are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, he found a very important wound in the abdominal, he told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmaceutical.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, came with skin injuries.
Effective national police detained the man without identity documents.
Nanterre's Fiscalía submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Senior Justice Police (SDPJ 92).
The place was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his temporary detention, he has not said a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of injecting it into a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at Clichy's police station where he was transferred.
It was "in the state of excellence" as "all this kind of oppression whose forces significantly increase under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
The French-Polish film lawyer Roman Polanski once again complained about this youth in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), who is considering the cause against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianist", complained before three judges of the Second California District Appeals Chamber of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that the charges are being dismissed at the same time, since the judge's conduct at the time of the case, Laurence Rittenband, "was a scalable one".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (born then) would have discussed with a prosecutor that he would have commented that Roman Polanski had to go to prison, before he had been sentenced, which is a serious lack of proceedings.
This discussion was published in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the own mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared in late September "had lied" to the author of the document.
Hummel appealed to hold a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument if the court refuses to condemn the case.
The charge, on the other hand, reiterated the initial argument, that there could be no serious assessment of any discontinuing of the charges as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
In 1978, 76-year-old cinematista fled from the United States before her sentence was pronounced "unlawful sexual relations" with less than 13 years old.
Since then, he's never been to the United States again.
The district vice-fiscal of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "should be here to present himself in the audience".
For this reason, we want to send the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is the possibility of fleeing? Asayama asked.
For her, the cinematist "calls for favor to the court, though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also emphasized "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel wasn't the only one who asked me to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also complained once more, to close the case.
She claims that her client no longer supports her arrival every time she resurfaces the Polanski case, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was right.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland by order of American arrest.
After more than two months after the raids, he was sentenced to home prison in his cabin in Gstad, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street loses the round and is frozen by the dollar's height
New York’s Bolsa closed this unrun Friday, in a market that talks between better indicators than the United States and the dollar's height: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached 65.67 points reaching 10,471,50 points, while Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located at 2,190.31 points.
The enlarged standard & Poor's 500 rate increased by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blacksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend remained due to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's view on the strength of economic reactivity", the analysts of Charles Schwab recalled.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November by two consecutive months and more than expected.
In addition, the US consumer confidence was clearly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimates of the University of Michigan.
However, the index was hampered by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months in front of the euro, which "takes down to the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explains Owen Fitzpatrick, from Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values have lost the ground.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year-old ten-year-old bonus income rose to 3,540 per cent against 3,482 per cent of the Wednesdays per night, and the 30-year bonus to 4,497 per cent against 4,492 per cent of the winter.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour by South Africa, 112 candidates to Miss World's title are in the final right to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a thousand million spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized by the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran de Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportist or, even, Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real revelation.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and I lived countless experiences!, said surprised Miss Sierra Leone.
This determination, which is carried out nine times in South Africa, will be transmitted on the Sabbath in force from Midand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 h (15 h GMT).
It's impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, notes Miss World Kseniya Sukhinova in the summer of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and the possibility of re-discovering "African landscapes that leave the alliance".
After a month of galas, tests, print wheels and safaris, the candidates to Miss World are focused on the summit.
India Pooja Chopra expects to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted to Bollywood stars.
The dream of all women is to be crowned as the most beautiful of the world, but it is not just the appearance.
We are ambassadors from our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will appear with traditional clothes and, of course, with bathroom.
The Chinese representative, Angela Chow, the former queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a member of Miss Mundo's committee, Steve Douglas, will conduct the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with a warm and difficult pride to equal, assuring Julia Morley, President of the World Summit.
Like last year, the candidates made a Safari, visited Soweto's famous cityship, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
As an exception, they met the South African President Jacob Zuma, who cut their hands.
A little bit common to a head of state, see Miss Sierra Leone.
Its best memory will no doubt be the luck in Cape Town (Sweden) for the World Football World in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I treated people I never thought I'd meet.
He probably returned to the 2010 World, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "very positive sound", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday's "very positive sound", he assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father several days ago.
News is very positive.
Father is strong and everything is coming out very well, declared to the press David Hallyday on the ground of the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13 hrs (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, separated, made sure that he would move to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered the moon by an infection resulting from the operation of dyskinesia last November 26th in Paris.
The music is "as induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus manage your treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered the moon by an infection, a skeletal cancer operation on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was once again operating the night of Wednesdays on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by previous intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, was in the morning at the French school in Los Angeles, where she attended her daughter Jade, to attend a school act, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopedic surgery and traumatology of the Pitê-Salpétrière hospital Yves Catoné announced that he would travel the moon to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November 26th at the international private clinic in Parque Monceau, Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were angry, Camus said.
It's about a possible request, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "flyed too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor and I was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, because I had been operating twice for dyskinesia, he added.
Shortly before the RTL station, he indicated that the singer seemed to have been "made without a channel, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artistic environment.
He worked at the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a Neuillely-sur-Sine clinic where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, I also interviewed the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorbate a hematoma formed due to brain hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by justice on several occasions by malaprax, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scrutinised" demanding "regularly" before the Order Council, and is " far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention "has been carried out without any inconsistencies" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause haemorrhages and therefore, there was no need for drainage," he added.
In any way, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, has entered a parentheses.
No doubt, taking the turn on January 8th (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I feel very upset, said Camus.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Centre about the use of its signal
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday before the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, attempted to launch an OPA (public Procurement Offer) on the flag of the former Jiscardist party, threatening to withdraw it from all support, with due regard to being demanded.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF signal, since he believed François Bayrou was not able to defend his political heritage after he had put his hand on the left.
On the other hand, the Minister for Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, she received assistance from Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claimed the property of the UDF brand, as it was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF office, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be private, broke the silence in order to send a request to the Minister and his delegation, threatening them to give up the mark and transfer the rights of the mark, their penalty for judicial claim.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that they were going to propose their political movement to recover the UDF signal, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Central Alliance.
They also believe that it is proper to continue using the name of the movement, the +New Centre+, and the slogan +the UDF of today's today' today' today' today+ in its militaristic material and on the site's presentation page, they support the signatories of the letter.
As you already know, they have no right to use the seal, explains the UDF's office that requires the NC to immediately remove "the mention of the name of the UDF of all support, as well as of the (your) website of the Internet".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the legitimate beneficiaries."
Otherwise, justice will be called upon to comply with the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warning the signatories.
In the letter, they need UDF "a true political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elected" to go to 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre does not, according to them, have any right to use the UDF signal.
They also recall that the latest UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement based on Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when the brand was registered", since it was not "member of the UDF for three years", but UMP.
Use the absence of registration of UDF acronym to carry it out by your account in a scandalous and fraudulent way.
This inclusion is becoming a crime, they complain, before the NC's strategy is broken down: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more honorable to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymously taking a name that has no right."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
This Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to appeal to the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt, would take advantage of the state of obstetric weakness to exploit her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime which is a maximum sentence of three years in prison and EUR 375,000 in fines.
This means that in this case there will be a decent process of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are discussed in the reigns of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the Court also ruled that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, had been subjected to a medical examination of three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's legacy and main shareholders always refused to submit to such examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Fiscalía during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday shall report before 10 March 2010 in which they shall determine whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and during what period.
I think he'll accept it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
On the other hand, the counsel of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was satisfied with the court's decision.
It's a great news... The peritence will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older woman, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, Liliane's only daughter Bettencourt launched criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing her of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain billions of euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or art works.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, who is considered a long-term friend.
On Friday, while the court considered the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' allegations were, on some occasions, a major family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his note in which he said he was mistrusted by the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for five years.
From his wedding, I can never speak again to Françoise."
On its part, the Nanterre Fiscalía de Nanterre considered once more that the applicant was not in a position to compare, as much as a lawyer denied, in these last days, his request to open a judicial procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to appear before justice, is not under protection and has no tutor.
No other person can be represented in his place," said the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs, Marie-Christine Daubignney.
Finally, the court decided that the decision on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered once.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the large French companies, our fight for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees recalls the position of consumers before the marketing revolution: it is the fact that employees add certain "values" to the above-mentioned values as before it was intended to impose on consumers products thought by the factory techniques.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the market revolution gave him a place in market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian attempt to impose products that do not relate to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
An employee demobilization can end in a deadly demolition.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the point of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly the I+D and, more important, the intelligence of business.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "needs all parties involved (...) to have a proactive behaviour and a prospective vision"; this requires a commitment by employees that is entirely contrary to the recommendations of an authority.
That is why we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting the employees at the centre of business concerns as much as the client.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative advantage
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, encourage the administrative revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many times, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they have always done!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, gradually increases the importance of its own shortcomings.
Finally, because most of the directives have a simple vision of human behavior.
As a result of major engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that the U.S. neurosciences have recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and Media have spread widely to their back.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the implementation commitment, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directives in a mechanical management position, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobility factors
On the contrary, the management revolution needed for the good functioning of modern enterprises involves adopting a final vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating in any business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if it appears clearly as a means to make it a part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Moti-functional Analysis take this concept of employees' motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a default dose that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobility factors, business directives can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and re-management of human resources "in the place".
In this way, they create a favourable land for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo's speech: for the "just war" Obama receives the praise of the right
This Friday, the right of North America, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the U.S. enemies, called for the speech Obama had uttered on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had denied the award to Obama on 9 October, this time appealed to the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for Vice-Presidentship during the 2008 elections.
I liked what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right-hand side of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and she added that she herself had addressed the theme of the war "at times necessary" in her recent published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, since then, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was dedicated, this youth in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the talk seemed very historical, Gingrich said, during an interview on the "The Takeaway" radio program.
The former elected representative, who some consider as a possible candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could give a prize of peace if the power did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's talks and current chronicler at Washington Post, Obama declared "a very North American speech".
In addition to being presented as "the citizen of the world", as "always doing it", "he spoke as a North American president" when he reminded Europeans "who live in a safe bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few unconventional right-wings, one half of Bush's age, former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, qualified for the "Monoton, Pretentious and Lack of inspiration" speech on the website of the National Review Online.
On the left of the president, Democrat representative Dennis Kucinich complained when he saw Barack Obama justifying the power.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-wing press praised the president.
The English Time, although still believing that Obama had received Nobel in advance, qualified his speech of "super-production" primarily for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper commented excitedly.
Obama "expounded the speech that was necessary," he loved the New York Times, judging it "as a shadow and assailant."
Road transport: three Marathon negotiations to ensure water supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only parental organization that remained until the end, came to an agreement on the strike and the threat of navigation.
During the signing meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "affiliated" by the agreement, after several negotiations that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators went to the white of the Friday with the hope that the text would be signed quickly at the end of the morning.
Even when three parental organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were withdrawn, they gave a carry.
But a more than six-hour meeting, which began at 11 a.m., was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "hubiese has been very harmful to businesses" and "he is afraid that the end of the year will disturb the parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The rate per hour is EUR 8.72 to 9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disappointment, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our military officers that there are no more cuts or blocks in the supply centres.
But there may always be some disconform rebellion, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good deal", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking account of international competition".
According to him, increases will be in order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and of EUR 100 to EUR 120 for the highest.
It is a common agreement with respect to employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as a "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is a "acceptable commitment".
The Agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a minimum of EUR 100 million in parental burdens" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification financing bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to be applied firstly to companies attached to this organization and secondly to all professions, if the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It's gonna be "with the fastest," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of parental organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "engine business" because EUR 100 million had been promised to the sector to pay part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to not contradict those who wished to eat bread at the upcoming Nochebuena dinner, the Union was disappointed.
For the OTRE, the agreement threatens "the stability of the sector's largest PYME in the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts at the end of the week, trade unions in accordance with the RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the second day of strike between trade unions and the direction of RATP, there was no agreement and the trade unions were not satisfied with their first request.
For this important weekend of shipping purchases, Saturday and Sunday will only travel trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m. due to a train of two in the central framework (between the Defence and the Nation) and a train of four in the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
Lafayette Gallerys, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP strives to provide services to large shops".
The RER Cross West to East Paris City.
The RATP tram runs from Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one of each two trains circled in hours at a point, and almost no train in hours of the valley, as was expected.
The Jews had not gone into exile because of the organization of the inhabitants of the French island.
In this way, the station of Saint-German-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old Jack Nbakina explained that he had been raised "an hour and a half earlier to arrive at time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not meet, indicated the SNCF, which had foreseen police and order forces.
The RERs that operate the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or with the purpose of arriving or sharing from the Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general meetings of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, "not satisfactory" according to the unions, from a meeting that took place on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all areas for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That's not what drivers want to claim for a loan they owe, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts between parentheses its first proposals, the CGT was angered, noting that the direction "was unable to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting was scheduled Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession", the RATP said.
What also led the trade unions to say that the company "did not care about users at the end of the week".
In the morning, some 150 drivers rented a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which was refused until then to speak during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the water".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had submitted a warning.
The unions call for a premium of EUR 120 (United States) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, total from EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 gross and EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums, for hours with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice deplores the procuring party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the resolution of the country's main party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could be very difficult for the government, which had just held a hand in the Kurdish community trying to end it up to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was disappointed because it had become “the focus of activities that damaged the independence of the State and its invisible unity”, said the President of the Court, Hasim Kilic, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was uniform, although only a majority of seven votes were required to obtain the resolution, Kilic indicated, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, among whom are President Ahmet Türk and Mr Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turkey and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasurer.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that the Members would leave Parliament before being MPs without a party label.
The decision arises from a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor Abdulrahman Yalcinkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political shell of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but it refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes when the Government holds a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that Kurds cease to support the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leaders stated that a resolution could generate a redundancy of tensions in the South Anatolio, where a large number of demonstrations against PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan's detention conditions were generated in conflicts with the police during the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators have met in front of the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the great care of the people of the South in most of their Kurds.
The Order Forces fired lacrimogen granulated and used water cannons, while the protesters launched Molotov bombs or sandstones.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was "to deepen the disillusionment".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurda, NDLR) by disclosing a party, declared the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
First of all, we oppose the closure of parties.
So nothing was resolved, Minister for Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely rejects the democratic opening by the government, political analyst Ahmet Issel commented.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was assisted by an attack that killed seven soldiers three days ago in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Nevads can start again
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Braubuer wants.
In fact, it is something he wants to make life impossible for citizens, he tells the director of road maintenance in the winter of the FES.
But with this, their employees can learn to try and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
It may be that at the end of the week the meteorologists announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EES shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as snow profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called tires A with large vehicles with salt, explains Braubuer.
These include, for example, major artries and adventures such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the body of bombers, public transport routes, petonal zones and trams with trailers, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
It should cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with a wet salt, which is better attached.
That's why the FES starts around the three of the Madrugadas, "that's where the roads are free until the traffic starts at the moment".
The difficulty is when it starts to snow about 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," said the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to waste space on the vehicles with salt."
Immediately thereafter, when he is no longer snowing, he touches on the secondary and private roads, which also belong to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary roads.
That's where the disturbances are generated, you know, Braubuer.
About five in the morning, the FES' childhood is under way, mainly the dangerous and crucial points are taken away.
In general, the EES could not be charged with all bicycles.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 does not lose sight mainly of the bridge, says Braubuer.
As these become rebalancing quickly, the vehicle with salt is running as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Church of the Dynosty
The Tawa hallae had the same aspect as many other meat dinosaurs: a two-metre-long and 1.50-meter-high animal running on the two strong legs behind it, had a long head with twisted teeth and curves, short arms with wooden legs and a long neck.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical characteristics, inform Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The species lived around 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the timely evolution of dinosaurs, comments Nesbitt.
We have much to show about the genetic relationship, the spread and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists launched an excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur eggs in one day, this is something unprecedented for Triasco's settlements, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some eggs as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remaining five species were gathered in total.
A discovery confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "The fossils of the Triasico dinosaur are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaurs do not share all such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to the current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts are discussing, for example, how the sauries were divided into their three most important genetic lines: the meat therapists among whom the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velocirraptor and also the birds are also known as the “long skin” and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivores (sauris with bird wings), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primary therapist.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, notes Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa branch, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those that also own the offspring of the therapists, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the doors of the vertebral column were clearly filled with air partially.
Tawa is the therapist with older and primitive air bags, comments Randall Irmis.
Due to the fact that the emerging line of later giant saropods also had air bags and light eggs, it was likely that the former common groups of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migration oils to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs have so far been living in South America, researchers estimate that sauries have emerged there for the first time.
As a result, the three genetic lines were separated from one beginning and extended from South America by all the roots of the Earth, which was still a single earth mass, the supercontinent of the Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team met with Tawa to find the rest of the other two not very impressively impressed.
The three cannot come down from a unique empressor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migration oils have been given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
A more ancient species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of brothers of dinosaurs, lived in the present Poland, comments the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because in South America, it is simply maintaining many fossils of dinosaurs, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how the dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant lands of Mexico remains an enigma.
While in Triasico the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current cocods and the petrosaries and many other sauries.
At the end of the Triasico, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while parentheses grew in the Triasco border towards the Jurasis.
The successful stories were not eternal
There are two possibilities to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction of which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to win the fighters in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact of meteorite slows down the growth of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triasco region and since then had brought about a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatures.
Participating in professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
They participate in teaching in Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, or Bremen.
The police departure from the casino occupied by the Goethe University of Frankfurt affected the whole world.
278 teachers and cathedrals of the Goethe University, although also of higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with students in protest at Westend Camps.
In a statement published in German and English, they "refused" the police departure promoted by the Governing Council.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the University, made the building occupied by students and teachers last week in educational jail because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
Material damage, judges the signatories, does not justify "the violent dissociation of the courses organized by the same students and cathedrals by a police command".
The expulsion represented an "inappropriate attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served as "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and drew attention to the content.
The Governing Council has refused to establish the necessary negotiations.
The doctors require immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most employees have not caused material damage, it is said.
In Our Protest
Young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade unions also join the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, commented the National Youth Secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Sciences of Hessen, however, defended the conduct of the director of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the director of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented on a current issue on Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, Peter Beuth, a representative of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the walls painted as a pretext to criminalize the protest, expressed Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of carefully studying the students' arguments and demands, they are dismissed.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, not accessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a well-guarded site for the secret research of arms.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered to be the "Silicon Valley Russian".
There are important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, Wednesdays, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Special Cooperation Protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Vice-Alcovita Juri Rosljak and Selengrad's mayor, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt, the planning services chief, Edwin Schwarz, signed.
In 2010, a seminar will be held in Selenograd by representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the research centre of natural sciences.
Scientific Exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also deals with commercial relations.
FIZ companies will have the possibility of placing a foot in the growing Russian market.
Instead, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the head of important Russian research companies and institutions.
Among these are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenograd (translated literally as "Green City") received his name from the landscape of forest mountains, where research facilities were located.
Frenos de Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not placed to anything high enough.
For project participants, it is easy and easily "the new heart of Europe".
The law I know. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monster construction project, which will lead to the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of unremediated construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with wires, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered to be the fossils of engineering in the 19th century, which acted as brakes of a modern railway traffic, since a huge amount of time was old enough to cover the rear locomotors forward.
Roarar, stop drying the trip; but this must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step-by-step station, which is approximately half of the trajectory of the trans-European operation lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Europe Heart".
The S21 will actually be launched, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have learned that in Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have any more input and output problems, since there are reversible locomotors with tractor unit and driver's car on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-constructed tram towards Ulm will already be launched.
Federal and municipal politicians have been willing to do so.
The railway continues, too, because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are borne by the contributor and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain point.
New urban space is created, provided by many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The step-by-step and viral support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the major typical growth in the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low cost flights.
However, modern transport policy must first take care to strengthen the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new structures are good for load trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 also directly affects many other railway projects.
More than EUR 6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that it is more realistic than 10 to 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be missing in other narrow crossings and crossings on the network.
A total of six major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of long row through the river of the Rhine.
Since 1987 the track has been built slowly.
It would be urgent here to force the accelerator as it is due.
However, S21 acts as a brake.
The river of the Rhine will be the bottle for international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The Government shall examine the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is staying in Wiesbaden's autonomous parliament if an appeal is to be filed against the failure to prohibit Hesse's nightly flights.
The Coalition of CDU/FDP seems to have charged experts with the legal investigation of the VGH judgment of more than 400 pages, according to the Ministry of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The Administrative Court in Kassel had established in writing on this date that, in the case of the construction of the North-West Landing Track planned at Frankfurt Airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if it will present the appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this succession and forced government representatives to give up the appeal before the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, called on the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises of a night's air traffic ban, which had been carried out before the elections.
It is very difficult, if one leaves it to fulfill his word, said the Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We will fulfill our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's criminality, that the federal government would be trying to obtain its overnight flights by means of law and tricks.
An extensive legal investigation would take a long time.
Coalition does not want to act on the basis of a "first press".
We need a legally incapacitated decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, his group's allegations of the night air traffic ban should never have been made.
U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The large US banks that have been hit by the crisis are disappointed with their state aid.
The Bank of America once returned the aid that had provided it with the Tarp bank balance fund of a total of 45,000 million (about EUR 30,000 million).
The Citi Group also plans to return State aid, according to a report by the U.S. CNBC.
The institutions therefore intend to exempt themselves from the restrictions that had been imposed on the acceptance of money, such as restrictions on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The Bank of America had obtained approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible loans.
The rest of the sum took the own box, which had plenty of means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked the night's Wednesdays especially for the US contributors: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The bank house had been miscalculated by the effort to absorb the investment bank in the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to earn money on the capital market in order to be free from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported that the United States bank could already announce the increase in its capital by $20 billion this Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to make comments.
In June, I had returned his aid to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
At last it was faster than he thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF's administrative council (German television channel) pressed the editor chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Yesterday night the Grim wanted to vote about the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially so as not to prevent the procedure.
But certainly also influenced not to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council either.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 crew members.
The outcome of the vote was yet to be decided at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for five more years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's expulsion was a painful failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because most of the Union in the administrative council had indicated weeks before the election, that they would not support Brender in their position.
The opposition against the editorial chief had been organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He issued another mandate of the editor-in-chief with the argument, which under the direction of Brennder, the ZDF's information would have lost audit indexes.
So far prior to the elections there have been protests due to this, in which political influence on the ZDF has been flagged.
Finally, 35 public law experts had been introduced into the debate, which described the Koch process as inconstitutional.
But he didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance philosophy.
Then he worked at the "Südwestfunk" station and the "Frankfurter Rundschau" newspaper.
In 1983 he changed to the ZDF, beginning with the "hete-journal" information.
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 staff member of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and director of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the external policy of the ZDF; then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional claim after the destruction of Brender, which was still elected as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Media Magazine".
Koch's opposition to the administrative council, the President of the Government of Renania-Palatinate, explained last week that federal states should change the ZDF's state convention in such a way that the proposals of the Director's staff cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of partial policies from the ZDF control creams was discarded by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative council with an intelligent game: he strongly criticized Brender's expulsion.
Thanks to this periodical independence test, Schächter was able to appoint him for the editor post without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote, without having to suspect that he was given the post to a party sequential.
In the calculations of the Frey parties, it is dedicated in all ways to the left liberals.
The university careers are dissipated
In a meeting of the Ministers for Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the case of education and mastering.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, it was agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically every module in the race must end with a single exam.
It is also intended to consider the work of the students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable remedy".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federal states that differ from this should no longer exist.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministers for Education and Culture and the directors of universities have always talked about improving their ability to carry out and successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time we talked about a particular content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to dramatically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with only one examination", says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university courses.
The "sensitive reduction in the burden of exams" is intended to prevent development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by Mr. Reinhold Grimm, Director of the Accreditation Council.
In addition, in the future "study" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be considered sufficiently as regards unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to have more space, which enables and promotes their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new courses, but also in the examination of existing courses.
These should be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean that it would be late by 2015 to examine all the courses.
This would be the responsibility of all 10 credit agencies throughout the country, which are under the supervision of the credit council, established by the federal states.
Education and Culture Ministers urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of material and examinations were not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
So far, Renania-Platinada has only provided additional means for the subsequent development of the Bolonia process.
With this money, universities must implement student education and advice programmes, as well as strengthen examination offices and outside.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wanted to bring to Parliament a new university law.
According to it, there should be only one review for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
Up to the end of the coming year is intended to examine all the courses about their "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
On the other hand, there were also criticisms about decisions.
At the federal level of the Juso (young socialists) university groups, the federal directive demanded that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out "by closed doors" by the ministers and university directors.
Later on after the careers of education, students as key stakeholders should also be able to think.
The president of the University Directors' Meeting (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need students' experience," said Thursday in a meeting with the Education Ministers, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW), Bonn's agreements were not sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a postmaster career.
In addition, federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are sufficient courses for Master with the best possible study conditions. Thus a member of GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller, informed him.
Federal states have to deal with a lot more teachers.
But with more access to the master, the Education Ministers did not comment.
More than a note on Herta Müller's foot
"Entering and leaving Germany is done practically without control" says the first line of a poem by Liric Werner Söllner in disequalifying linguistic fragments, in which he fears the experiences of coming to Germany living by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at the beginning as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book editorial, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Søllner received several literature awards, in 1993 he published the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum in Moussonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
He said that he talked quite yesterday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the unwritten mirror of his security agents"
Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the secret service of the German-Romanic writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment efforts had begun slowly at the beginning of 1971.
"That's why I'm someone who didn't defend himself sufficiently against the attempts to provoke fear of security," Söllner concluded.
Liric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and its literary polymetics without equal to the dictatorial domination mechanisms, the literary scene and in particular the German community of authors from Romania are cut off by a case that demonstrates the existence and evil of a political system, based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as he is known so far, not only author, but also victim.
In his IM Walter security expedition he had played a role, the literary scientist Michael Markel said after Søllner's confession, and recalibrated the influence for him positive of the IM Walter.
He had apologized or defended him at all difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-disidant and his work with the brother's secret service, however, is not surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller in July in the "Zeit", after reading his own 914 pages.
The involved will certainly have speculated and known in some cases what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter's sydonyms.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi expeditions with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the security control officers is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification was seen in the last few years.
A National Council for the Explanation of Security Officers (CNSAS) to the Birthler Authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the expeditions has been better followed since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of the expenditure.
An interview, after granting the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proved that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview an ex-prime of the Temesvar Security spoke negatively about the condecorate.
"She's got psychosis," they finally just asked her once.
The family of power seemed to be able to show freely under the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, there are inevitable questions about the Søllner case, as often as there are closed cases.
Why is it right now? To whom has it been hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners to Søllner's confession lets us hope that the continuation of this story will be more guided by the anxiety of knowledge and not only by the dedication of guilt and shame.
For the genius of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, it is more than a simple note to the foot.
The League of Campions as a guarantee to fill the stomach
When the new VfB football team trainer from Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, approached a Mercedes taxi from Class C a quarter after midnight, he was impressed that a member of the elegantly dressed external service was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports item manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man of the calva character had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
On the other hand, he could also drive the car himself: at the end of the accounts, there was no alcohol in the game, and he was not happy with the 55-year-old man.
It had been a pleasant summer, but tomorrow I would start work again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, which had been hired only three days ago, "It is true that we reach the final eighths," to know, in the Campeones League, that thanks to the triumph 3:1 against the Urzicen Union, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves stand for success: we will have to fight brutally against the decline."
The "more important field" was waiting for them the next Sunday, he said.
Then, there will be a need to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the dailyity of the link.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have become evident again, after the three quick waves of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Output
The final octaves of the Campeones League (from 16/17 to 23/24 February/ from 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the shining entry of Babel’s successor remained limited.
Not only in the supposed rescuer, who had recently inspired the uncontested professors of Stuttgart to rely on themselves, ready to deliver and enjoy the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strong points, insisted on being more released, explained the undoor of the Gross soul's recipe of success that was so simple sound, but that with the Babel therapist no longer had any effect.
He showed some magic, accepted Babbel's partner, Jens Lehmann, "while in the football a new impulse arises, sometimes things that were not believed to be possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks of suffering, continued to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "fenomen" perceived with the proverb "freshness" and the way to work with the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes in the background, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what had been missing, obviously, when it was Babel.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warning sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs most of all.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator were also prevented from overestimating the triumph against a weak defence due to lack of relevance and fully based on the brothers' guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had come the sad wake, he thought Khadira.
And Director Horst Heldt warned that although an objective of the period had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't dealt with the problem yet.
That Heldt would not wish to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his headquarters for three months, was due to the events at the end of the week, which were refurbished in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had given the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions others make, and not Jens, Helt faced Lehmann's critical burden.
This had caused a weakening in the direction of the Governing Council, which had been decided to change trainer by pressure from adolescents.
He would also have been removed from his free day after the games he qualified Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," heldt replied, and announced consequences for the last.
They'll probably not be friends forever, the two-fourths.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without the prior efforts of the trainer's team replaced, it would not have been possible for the show of great power to play and fight.
Babbel and his assistants had “a significant participation in success”, said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and I also agreed with the man of the plastic bag.
Pelagia of the world champion of heavy weights
Ardient pain in Berna: again and again, renderer Kevin Johnson was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his weight-weighted title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was uniform.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko continues to be a heavy global campaign.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC's version won in the evening of the Friday evening in Bern, U.S.A. Kevin Johnson decided unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was its third successful defence of the title since its return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainians had already been a global champion of WBO and WBC associations twice.
Unfortunately, the cloud that everyone had expected could not be realized.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triunfos in 41 professional wars, twice due to his injuries.
Rector Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his war number 24.
Before about 17,000 spectators at the Arena of Berna, Klitschko, with a 2.02 meters statue, I wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, nine inches below, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era before, was hiding once and for all the attacks on the world campaign, so Klitschko could not take decisive action to its dangerous right target.
In general terms, Pope Johnson made too little for a retreater, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although I was causing Klitschko with words and gestures, his attacks only rarely reached the world campaign.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who spent twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the war, the recruiter had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
I've insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," which "does not know what to do."
When the siege was over, the campaign was allowed to provoke the Friday to take Johnson away from the sunglasses of the nose "to be able to see her eyes."
The fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth battle after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained unconventional.
After a nearly four-year break, he won the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his "his" belt from the WBC, which had previously had to be delivered without fighting.
That year came after his defense at Juan Carlos Gómez, Cuba, and in September at Chris Areola, in the United States.
In this fight I just got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still gathering all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a global champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after it destroyed Nikolai Valujev in November of 2.13 metres of property.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a battle against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, for false information on Kunduz.
The SPD and the left-hand side require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlín – Following the latest announcements on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has challenged the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), who has made a false accusation.
In the release of news "Tagesschau" on Saturday, transmitted by the ARD television channel, the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "sense had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two trucks.
In such a case, it is usually said that he lied.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Defence Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that the NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg had read, said Trittin.
Friday had been informed that in this attack, it was not only the destruction of stolen trucks but also the intentional killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. aircraft attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left asked federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy was part of the federal government's policy of Afghanistan, and if the Chancellor, Army and Information Service had approved this new strategy, they asked Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Green Renate Kunast.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor did not exercise any influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there was also doubts about the submission made by the Ministry on the reasons for the resignation of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and fully about the background of the attack on the vehicles.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two senior officials, it was reported that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a document from two pages of Colonel Klein, who was under command, and a report from a field patrol.
However, Wichert would have requested a letter explaining the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter General Sontagszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer until now, he said.
The Ministry did not appear on the Sabbath regarding the references made to it, and pointed out that this would be made clear in the Federal Parliament's research committee, which would be the next Wednesday.
Unorientated worlds
In the state of alertness, some people see images and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug abuse, there is a gap between imagination and reality.
While it happens during the dream, everything's fine.
When we are trapped in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver ourselves without trouble to the most vivid imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who are experienced like sleep-like during the watch, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, most of the time in the modern Western world is considered to be crazy or drug addicts, or at least as manipulative.
But such images and voices do not arise only in mental illness or in drugs.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, at times make the gap between dream, luck and reality.
The modified alert consciousness states can appear in the most different ways, in the best of the cases we call visions, and in the worst, in the worst.
Although the disseminating effects and effects can be distinguished, they can be referred to processes similar to the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of Chamanian possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
Alucinations or deliriums arise when neuronal communication substances in the brain have been eliminated – above all dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcoline – and the interaction between several parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often there are complex hallucinations and locked up thoughts.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between sleep and sleep has been with philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle designed the illusions as a form of dream in the state of surveillance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of living with the ovarian states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the misappropriationses, trained trainings, and spying on it".
It's the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is of two dimensions and scandalously colored.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the roof of the room.
He's feeling sick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mice like blood, deformities, washing the teeth.
They're chasing him, beating him with heavy and flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
You strutting and bad guys get back from the walls and the radio.
You can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. starts two cables of the stereo, pulls them up to form a hole in the roof, and puts them in a hole in the roof.
He gets up in a box and puts the cloud around his neck.
Salta.
The door is down.
What a lesson for you!, the voices cry in a choir that brings you back to the Times, "Come to the clinic and make you care!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and he's experimented with six psychosis acutes, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The reason the product was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is psychosis schizophrenia-affiti-paranoid, it is also maniaco-depressive, takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deep despair, she says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
About 1 percent of the population falls sick at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times affected are no longer able to distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overheating that can lead to hallucinations, deliriums of greatness, relationships disturbances, or persecution.
Specially extended is the hearing of voices: voices giving orders, comments or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is seen as a flood of impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens up the competitions to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says cathedral Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time, it goes into a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and can't actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
I've experienced an allusion once in my life
On the contrary, Fuchs says, "the space and sensory structure of the reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle such."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are supported in reality, the distance from experience is in reality.
For the researchers, it's still a mystery why our brain makes horses.
According to Fuchs, exceptional states can lead any person to lose contact with the reality provisionally.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but bone studies have shown that in addition to genes there are other determinant factors.
Researchers suggest that the affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that brain neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it continues to be an unknown way that the neurological system changes occur, which also does not appear at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience may be the detonators of a psychosis when there is a previous provision.
Similarly, alkaline drugs can cause a psychosis, as they interfere with the brain transmission system.
When the brain warms
The logic of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says psychologist Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
To see an allusion as acceptable or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die Irreale Welt in our Kopf (The Real World in Our Head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms associated with psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among these are, along with psychological disorders such as the limited disorder of personality or depression, frequent diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and craneocephalitis.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
They occur when the brain areas in which sensory perceptions are being processed are hyperactive or are less cohesive; when our brain is hot, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the bad love or other brain state of exception.
In younger studies, up to a third of the respondents had at least once in their lives experienced Hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. At 16 years of age, she lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attended a secondary school.
A running girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, it happens that a boy with long hair and dark hair is directed by the word.
When she answers, the other students look at her with surprise; no one except her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting on the side bank.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she asks if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
During the night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a load.
When she's in class sometimes she can't follow the lesson because the teacher – in her eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest she explains mathematical equations in a visible and hearing way.
During the night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which is often late and is slow, he does not know whether he is awake or asleep, if the images he sees, the mice or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear before their eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, call them in the figures.
His parents and friends didn't tell them anything, they thought he was crazy.
October 2009. Sarah K. She is 20 years old today.
He approved last year selectivity and lives with his bride.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Since she's been in contact with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Liqueur is also an art work for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and it is the same to seek entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he realized that the man he called Father since he used the reason was not his biological father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and sound impressions, to those affected like Sarah K. It's hard to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasy as a form of hallucination.
Healthy people's hallucinations do not differ essentially from those of an acute psychosis.
On the contrary, the eschizophrenics are mentally healthy people who are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends to your patients who appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Sleeping and Aligning Limits
in this world too focused on consciousness, imaginary experiences are generally pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a cathedral in Heidelberg and a doctor chief of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic in Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – the joy is an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called unanimity, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The ionacic alusions are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them is real and that later cannot differentiate from being revealed.
The ovarian consciousness states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculineropia, who experience a motor paralisity which is fully conscious. di bee bee vollem Bewussstein een motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of one or more of the world due to a total and permanent motor capacity, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a self-imposed world that is detached from reality.
A limited form of situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is impossible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change is taking place, although the real situation is still present in the picture.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an inequitable situation is that our own creative capacity enables us not to blame us for any loss of consciousness.
Everything's real, even later in memory
also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his unique experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when his conscience was on trips several days after an operation of cardiac valves with a heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to mobility at the intensive care station.
Clossen met in a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he saw laid in bed, a man on the side of a sanatorium on a train, a robot wept for his health.
He was seen in the high middle age, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle chased him into his country of origin, made surf over his hospital bed in the Alps with nine firemen and met with a huge Korean man.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these trips are essentially different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
More clear and intense than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience fosters the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the Psychiatry Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, honesty, psychiatry, hallucinations, and stupefactions show the fragileness that it is the internal reproduction of the external reality, even when we are exposed.
Each change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be entirely enriching.

Burda
Children will take charge of the editorial at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has come to a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the family's hands.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at 27 years of age and have the firm's firm's will to enter the company, Burda, 69 years old, confirmed SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they're trained for it.
One cannot put 7,500 workers in front of his children if they are not trained enough to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda told him the Thursday that he will be removed from the presidency of the directive and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of the Burda Directorate since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was charged with the treasurership and thus earned responsibility for the property of the company. After Jürgen Todenhöfer's release, he was also charged with direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family cares about the cover of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves as "save the differences of 10.15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the family's hands.
With a view to the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda showed that family companies are also not exempt from the decadence: "This has always affected families who are being infected by the hunger of capital search, who have judged bad and thought that they could be raised as well as the largest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "great deliries," says Burda.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with "Time" in the world link; these businesses have become too big.
Integral Belleza
All that's about beauty and well-being-- you can wish, to the extent of your hand.
This seems to have been proposed by the British Court, which just opened up at the commercial center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and memory of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has a solid prettis like Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation; Space, with aesthetic relaxation and treatments; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or, who has a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, which highlights the theatre, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your spouse while viewing the unforgettable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relaxers with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a cup of camp are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most recent facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also features these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' that will guide customers' steps, offering them a fully customized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and vomiting) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to pass through the pelukeria, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery rituals, lightness or personalized nutrition are offered.
Innovation and exclusion seem to have been the prizes of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the Barcelona Association, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Construction of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road path for the installation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to stimulate what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electrical cylinders'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla joined the project.
The three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, are to promote the installation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It is therefore intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalunia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in European standardization groups and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a security horizon' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, saw "a horizon of peace" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled was the main exporting sector in the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has taken in the course of the exercise to support the car sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of leaving, close to some of our main productive plants," the President of the Government said.
"Thanks to this plan and the provision of the following brands in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can have a horizon of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (IPA), was aimed at 800 million projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernise existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government measures to support the demand, in addition to the 2000E Plan, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automovies.
According to the President, this plan has allowed a 6 per cent reduction in the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has contributed to a "strong increase" in matrices, which increased "about 40 per cent" in November.
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Room will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will be developed from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Babylon of the House of Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres in which more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find all kinds of articles related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exhibitors, accessors, changes, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delicacy of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies are, among other things, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-France Poeche sales and repair of cars; or Classic Cars, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Experiments of external competence
In addition, the commercial activity of this Chamber will be completed with parallel activities: the holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, evidence of skill, presentations and competition.
Tests of skill will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles in a circuit equipped at the outside of the railway station.
Mazda3 I-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sports is not related to respect for the environment.
As a result, just insert in Mazda3 the stop and launch system of the engine-baptised as i-Stop-, a device that is available at least for the moment only with the 2.0-gasol engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is highlighted by the good note achieved throughout it.
The exits, the end of the vehicle, the habitat, the behavior, the mechanic, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driving position, we have checked that the front shoes present excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Also, the touch of the volunteer is required.
Continued with the set formed by the table of instruments and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a future interior design, with a large number of buttons and handles and calling colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese and German, contrast with the sovereignty of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, to whom all want to fight.
Continued with the living room, this Japanese compact offers more than enough room for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
For all of this, there is a wide variety of disease and with regular forms.
The engine stop and automatic start system, at least for the moment, is only available with two litres and 150 horses and with the manual change of six wheels.
This engine is a real delight. It is over by its finish, by its reduced noise, by its performances and by the achievement of a contented consumption.
And it is that although the most requested Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not achieve a high number of kilometres per year should not discard this i-Stop with a gas engine, both for their high run comfort and for their consumption.
As for the level of equipment, the version selected for the test is called Sportive, i.e. that includes a larger number of serial elements.
Of the series equipment, it is especially the car exchange assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, tracking and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, the computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air-conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and slow 17-pound radiation.
In addition, if it wasn't for its equipment, this version was with the Premium Pack, which added 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptations and BOSE audio system with disk loader, among other items.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It is particularly important for the quality of the materials used, for their behaviour and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to choose by this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0-150-wheel fuel engine.
The only inconsistencies in this model are its high price, which is between EUR 21.770 of the finished Luxury and EUR 23.270 of the proven version -Sportive-.
Instead of this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us great doses of satisfaction every day.
'First' of July
L. A. covers the red carpet of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars appeared more than ever in elegant models such as 'sexys' in the 'Nine' star. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, chose for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to view the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse through the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly rate, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
With success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free life data service instead of paying six more times for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third encarnation.
It's just as limited as your American opponent, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what to do when you cross the border or look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a background connection) in order to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and it takes time to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience, there is a lack of a doctorate in physics to understand them and a good gauze to read the little letter.
The European Commission's repeated earphones to achieve acceptable roaming rates for all Europe have only had a visible effect.
Outside of the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and for good reason.
That an apparatus such as FonPeek (don't leave it curious to take the name of Fon when it's missing from Wifi) achieves this type of tariffs means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortise their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including downloading books and other online consultations.
No contracts and no cash.
It is a connected device and is paid for by buying it, not for months.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, an option to buy with life-saving access like Peek already has in the United States.
Not because you're going to buy it.
I'm watching my mail on the phone, thanks.
I hope because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Amarillo is no doubt the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If he had already taken possession of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a garment and a cover of this color, he has chosen the same thing to accompany him in his second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with bright reflections, the two times the act is made up of three pieces - dressed, jacket and cover of the same screen - and decorated with a large edge or crown.
It is so, that in a first glance it seemed that the first lady in the United States was following the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat a dress.
But the table in which the two trays are packaged makes them very different.
If for the possession of a fat bag, Oslo is a printed third party.
The plugins have also varied: medium-sized green shoes once again, and a similar model, but in dormant, now.
And also different is the pendant: a collection on this occasion, melena slows the previous one.
75 per cent of working mothers have had working problems for their mother
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is how the study 'Fecundity and labour trajectory of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey between 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 shows no doubt that 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of marriage and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have a job outside of home, work part-time, or have a job that is not stable, start their marriage first, advance their first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, have reduced their livelihood and maternity rate, and have fewer births.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after the beginning of the marriage, a figure increasing to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have taken more time from their vital trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to establish the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a lot of influence on maternity, although less on the company's calendar," explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that distinguishes women's age from marriage and having the first vaccine.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the greater the age in which they get married and the greater the age in which they have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 average respectively.
"There is also another division between women according to their level of studies.
While those who have elementary studies are married and have their first child before getting a stable job, the medium or higher levels of employment will invest in this sequence and give priority to obtaining stable work as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
The Paris Oréal just added a new name to its envy list of Ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will become a picture of different brand products, enchanting the universal theme of 'Why I Valgo'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actors of the international panorama, is joined by other famous figures from L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the Evangeline Lilly actresses ('Perdidos') and Fredida Pinto's'Slumdog Millionaire'.
In the male apartheid, the cosmetic brand also has luxury embassies: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey' Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (the companion of the Gospel in 'Perdidos').
British Mode Awards
The British have much to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual award of their prizes, held in London, in the Royal Court os Justice.
No one's missed the date.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Year's Model.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents a 30-year-old writer's radiographs that have passed through his literary life (and, in some cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and frightening genes (animal comparison, life and work), but seeking something similar to the core of the ignition of the creative character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not hide sweats or lightings.
In addition to a pleasure requirement, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I gave them some instants here.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, the same as I felt without giving him a name: the pleasure against the fate of the acage, the moral and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, a happy Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a vengeful poetic humor, without any sense, like the yoke of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was drowned by this woman with a passion that lasted for three years, in whose flesh combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of removing, a spiritual privilege consisting of reaching heaven through the way of loss."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ullises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be scaled across the northern wall, from which the best alpines are reflected once again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a rare guy.
Of course, he used to say that he was the heir of an heir of the county and others who was the son of a black man and a cocodile.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the scream from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and did it on a journey running from himself and calling for succession with a violent speech to the Gusanas."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got dressed up and said, "Dear God, I'm begging you to let me write as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these words were written to Spencer: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the resuscitation after the war,/ after hard life comforts death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the team he also brought his depressions.
The husband readily accepted that she had told him that Eduardo VII was spying on the Azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
Never has the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went ahead of his place."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inculcate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet attempt to pass to Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but throw off that man's fame so that she could serve him as a pedagogue?"
Abbreviated Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother passed through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged 15 and 18 passed along with her and our dog, a copy of a mastic breed, saved from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word of a word, they owned two pajamas that left the injured dog.
Our hatred is mausoleum because we do not find fun in a free aggression to a small and indefensive animal, which, of course, was attacked.
This must be added to the fuss that caused a woman who passed by quietly and who, when she deceived these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, finally, with anything weaker than herself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of any Tuesday for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint in a nearby commission that we doubt that it serves for a lot and not generate any suspicions, just to make it clear that the murders were Spanish.
The hatred has led us to declare this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to treat an undefeated animal free of charge that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvil together with the use of casco
The neumatic manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Vial Security (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among younger motorists, to inform both entities today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protection element that can prevent injuries in the head or, even, death in the case of an accident while driving on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was part of his commitment to viral safety, that "will go beyond design and manufacture more secure products every day" and that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and information-related actions.
This new campaign for the promotion of the use of cash in the motorcycle, under the title 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which cards will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycles, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that veal security "is a constant concern" for the company, since when it is a manufacturer of two-wheel neumatic vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop more and more secure products.
Up to the sale of light commercial goods
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles starts to see something light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units that met in November in Spain represented a rise of 12.6 per cent in 2008 and, most importantly, suggested the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the pattern of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam vendors.
The good data should not be taken into account, since the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60 per cent decline over the previous year.
As a result, despite the deadline of the last month, the accumulated matrices in these 11 months are 40 per cent below the previous period.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold in total all vehicles consisting of light commercial sawmills: tourist extracts, pick up, vans, light cars and trucks/light chassis.
Moreover, the majority of purchases have been made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100 per cent of the cases through external financing.
In order to ensure that the restrictions imposed by the closed flu of banking credits are met, other factors such as increasing rates of pay or the persistence of poor economic situation must be taken into account.
In the face of this panorama and unlike tourists, the aid has recently been used to buy 2000E.
In addition to the individuals, autonomouss and pymes who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, the number of operations has been evidenced.
Yesterday, from Ganvam again recalled the need for special attention from the Administration to these vehicles as well as to industry (cars and buses).
The association of sellers predicts a 2010 similar year that ended, for which it calculates a fall in sales (from tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency relief aid is already required
As with the ABS brake block and will pass through the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, it is already in all the light new matrices and commercial vehicles, while for the rest there is a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure, which is imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pets, although it can also help to avoid many collisions by way of work.
The emergency brake assistant is increasing the pressure on the brakes in the case of an emergency, which the system detects by the pilot giving the driver.
But this does not always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for Bosch car, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision and half of them had not taken advantage of all the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of aid, in turn, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to be stopped.
According to one EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents could be avoided annually in which petons are involved.
The reduction will be even greater - it will be calculated that one of the four scenarios would be avoided with damage to persons - when the so-called smart emergency braking system is popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, help him by increasing pressure on the leg, if necessary.
In the event that it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device makes the maximum effort to minimize damage to the brakes.
General Motors delay until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - the 8th probably - according to the report of Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the Opel recovery plan.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, hopes is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
This could make the final document submitted to the workers first and then to the Governments of the countries in which the factories are located is delayed until early 2010.
On the other hand, since GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as far as possible.
GM allows to contact some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but weighs the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
If it had not agreed with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to the Baic China.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if not sold.
To the flight from the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its final, and toward joy, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as the base and managed to extend nothing less than 80 kilos, which left the bascule in just 1,275 kilos.
This led to their first contact with the automatic roof that has been suspended by one of the wires with manual action, with which 21 kilograms are stored; using aluminium doors such as the GT3, 'caen', 15 others; removing the air-conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel storage of 64 to 54 litres, 7 pounds more; mounting the 12 other sports bags and with 19 light sheets, five.
Finally, decommissioning the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door shooters by one of the screens, the remaining kilogram.
Although it is also offered with the double-embering PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly by secondary roads in California, on foot of a mountain with really reversible tracks
Your behavior can only be classified as incapacitated.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not break the asphalt with aploma.
Instead, everything is different: it was a time when we didn't test a model so small and light that, once again, it transmitted so much safety on the curve, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete, able to warm your muscles in a short walk during the time you need, until we order you to be printed, that you freeze, that you recover and repress your engine...
What we ask you to do, thanks to your direction, as precise as you are, what we say with our hands in the flight is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.

The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be powered with the 'port' option and through a system that changes the brake of the engine, already stretched forward in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stop or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads that we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car ran well.
Electronic aid only made an act of presence across the street; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, it's already coming in the morning.
Finally, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can in the market and that is something more than a simple change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Beginning of Karl camperfeld, picture of the Coco Cocoon line and occasionally 'starlette' of the 'maison' files, the singer develops his evil face with as much contusion as his Chanel pockets.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia is given a victory in Israel
The Working Box achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 on its visit to the complicated corner of Maccabi Electro, despite the many lows with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic was counted, and this is how it is located in the leadership of its group, following the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight triples noted was the best of its team (29 rating).
The Victorian team plans to supplement the important absences of Herrmann, Olison, Huertas or Mikov with large doses of involvement and collective work, even though it had to endure to the end in order to deal with the victory.
In addition, the great aquifer from the perimeter, with 16 annotated triples, had much to see in the final triumph.
The game started face to face the blues, which have been put from the beginning in front of the marker.
That the first four canads of the victorious were from the perimeter, it had already predicted that they had jumped to the Israeli canyon with the hot ants.
English and Teletovic were the main articles of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more than the same, but the Alavis team chose by the internal game of Barak and the work of Elijah, which was received with pins and applause on the return to which his home was, to continue expanding his advantage at rest (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to highlight as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minimum six' of Splitter' assessment had already made it presuppose that it wasn't the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being in charge of the rest, was not determined nor much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the winners that in their cannon no one wins, and with 'Elijah'' they gained their victory.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the return of 'marillos' to the light (50-49).
More Inconsistent
Ivanovic's wounded but not much less dead, needed to rent a pair of games with air tankers, and in them came Mirza Teletovic's amplifier, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a calming rate (54-67), which enabled them to make the places at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The eagles came out to leave the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not reassert and tried to keep their team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter deleted by mistake, the Ivanovics did not advance, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the party had already owned it and the victory had escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the period.
The injuries prevent fighting at Unicaja
The Unicaja lost a lot in Greece before the Olympics and handed over to the leader of Eurolegic Group B, in a party marked by the low castes, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not represented by the atmosphere of the Pabellon of Peace and Amistid and not by the rival entity, perhaps of Europe's most powerful and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed you to dream of the Andalus. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of the Omar Cook base and one of Guillem Rubio's, delumbated to the places 12-18, minutes 9.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him back to marker 22-20, minute 13, at the moment when an action, known as war, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, was subjected to the decalation of both players.
The Greek community began to function by displaying its superiority within both areas, where the downsizing of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal failures were being inflicted on the castes.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian hero Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the 44-32, minute 19.
A Reunion Impossible
The third period was very offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown higher and even achieved the difference between the meeting held in Málaga 66-48, a 27-minute minute, which made the group's leadership even better.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last drop of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences, the Unicaja by Cook's direction and triplets, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, min 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics when they picked up and gave up their height in centimetres within the area seemed impossible.
The Croat Pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to remount the bashket alert 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja disappeared, giving the leader to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the searcher with a larger number of ads classified as real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculate the user's wages from more than 140.000 employment offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
On the week when the application is in operation, the searcher has found that in general, the Spanish worker "is feeling poorly paid", explained in a communication by Trovit's product manager Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its searchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer covers EUR 45.226 gross annual and one French, 31.059, against the 24,000 who receive a Spanish.
In the same way, a driver covers EUR 34.247 per year net in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is the camel, with EUR 11.592 net annual; followed by the employee, with EUR 14,725; and the operator, with EUR 15,667.
The most wanted jobs in the network in the last three months are the driver, the average job and the social worker.
Brazil dates out of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The Presiding Debt shall leave diplomatic legacy no later than 27 January 2010, when officially completing its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for the business of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that day of the embassy, where he has remained refugees since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on 27 January, when he has completed his mandate, he has to seek another destination."
The station also quoted the former commander, who confirmed his intention to leave the package before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (which resulted in the election of Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya made sure that she would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the political asylum condition that the Government had intended to impose on him "in fact" by President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since the spring in which the inflation of assets has been dominant in the markets, once again the uncertainty comes back to the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in a environment where agents decide on the future by accident.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilize the markets was charged with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free balance bar to close-to-zero types so that financial entities can buy assets for profit.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually completed and, without question their heterodox liquidity policy, start to take some of the arena in the Hungarians as the ECB did with its subsidised year-by-week.
As a result, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are in the process of helping to reverse risk premium reduction.
The flexibility of the Bolsas and the differences in corporate benefits have been repeated, although they remain very far away from the paranormal levels that reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again, there is a high-quality flight and the EU, Japan and Germany have been elected by investors, leading to an expansion of the differences in eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this episode of instability, but it had reached Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the downgrading of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that it is wrong for moral defenders to try to create awareness about those who are responsible for global economic policy because of the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to determine a new day of grace.
Dubai's, however, paints a tribal struggle between the emissaries to compensate for the power in the emissaries and Greece we have seen before.
A government that conceals public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the trigger.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duráno Barroso.
It does not make sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from a failure to comply with its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a euro Member State to fulfil its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and accountable to its citizens for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some surpluses in developed positions, it would be within expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt are widening, we should not worry about European corporate benefits.
If Europe's differences decline and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasy risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdot. When our advanced indicators are requiring most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their high-level scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to charge with a Japanese stage for the Spanish economy does not raise much hope of life to its warning.
Once again, it has all the painting that will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "study, driver friend".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday in the Subcommission of the Congress of Members in which the energy strategy for Spain was being discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, following the president of Natural-Fenosa Gas, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some pins of what he had planted in the subcommission to the closed door.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030, provided the nuclear power stations are open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Yes, Iberdrola believes that investments should not be intended to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections in the coming decade.
Since 2020, the issue has changed and will have to increase power.
Its apricot focuses on both gas plants and carbon with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that there are 18,000 new MWs, that is, with other "supported energy".
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act, which has just approved the Government, is in line with what his company has come to claim, did not want to shed blood with the real decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which contradicts anti-climate policies.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term appeal" in this regard, despite the "puncture" measures, as the President of Iberdrol called them.
Whatever the case, Galan believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should be started because they are late to grow, and a stable return framework is needed to address them.

Action against your first bus trip in Australia with Hottief and Bouygues
Action is fought by its first autopist in concession in Australia, a market where it is already working as a water company and manager.
The work in play is the tunnel valued at $1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million).
The French Boygues and Sister Hochtief are his rivals.
A 5 km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east side, has become the nearest option for Action to sit in the country as a builder and concessionaire of autopsies.
The City Association wants to have it at the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP for its signals in English) to move forward the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to work and exploit the sword.
In the hope that their tenders will be made in May, the planned investment will amount to $1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million) and in the final phase will consist of three concerts with a significant presence of European builders.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Akiona, the only Spanish in Liza, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the team of Akiona plays the Northern Direct Consortium, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last concert that has taken place in the club is the called LBRJV, where Australian Lighton shares capital (the subsidiary of the German constructioner Hochtief, as part of the ACS), Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the specialized Gale signature in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but makes it clear that it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the so-called Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, which continues to be a pending assignment for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has only achieved a position on that market through its 30 per cent participation in Hochtief, owner of the mentioned Lighton.
Millions Active
It acts by a geographical area of greatest importance to the sector, where it has already been very active through its activity as energy supplier and in the trade in desalination.
Among other assets, it has its largest ecological park, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide desalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and use synergies to enter infrastructure construction and operation fields.
The underground stone road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Northern Link), is called to join the Western Road of Toowong with the direction of circulation in Kelvin Grove (see map) over 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the most action to reduce congestion in the Brisbane traffic.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the work in December of the next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two cars in a sense, an electronic oil system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruits to Hochtief, who announced yesterday a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The participation by ACS will enable, through its local Lighton branch, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with optical fibre cable.
This action will provide fast Internet access to 400,000 people and will give German employment for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the King George Tower from 27 plants to the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still under way and Hochtief closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.

More than 63 million in France Telecom to boost competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited fixed and mobile telephony competition with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to consumers within the framework of the regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state company collects more than EUR 560 million in large numbers since 1994 for their competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has actually been increased because the authority responsible for the competition considers France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reciprocious.
Application store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch has followed the star of other operators and has opened an online application store, with the aim of increasing non-voting revenue.
In principle, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.

Play the Championships has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and the Boat since its origin
The Campeones League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So, that the Royal Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, what makes them the third and fifth clubs that have won the most money in competition.
The list leader is Manchester United.
The list leader is Manchester United.
Gaining the UEFA Championships League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from major clubs.
Thus, the competition has allocated EUR 5,362.5 million to 105 teams (12 of Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in 1992/1993, according to UEFA data.
The Royal Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have come out of this department.
The White Club has been the third of the continent's most money has been spent on participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, has won the trophie three times.
The Catalan, the upcoming campaign and the final winner of the Great Cup of Europe in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list is led by the Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams that also accounted for more money by participating in the past Campeones League.
And that, despite losing both of them in front of the boat.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has earned more money through the Championships, although it has won more titles than anyone else (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This paradigm is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the agency that President Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million by the League Championships.
From this money, UEFA will spend 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre-classification round (including the Madrid Atletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were able to participate received only 3.8 million for being there, plus other EUR 550,000 for each party they dispute.
There are also bonuses for winning (€800,000) and for empathizing (400,000 for each team). Octavofinists will earn three million each; the eight quadrinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The campaign will win 9 million, against the 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The vessel, on the other hand, was deployed 2.5 million to win the Superscope of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the relative value of each television market.
The Spanish is of the mains, and it has four assigned places.
The previous year's campaign is based on 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party shall be paid according to the number of parties to be played in the edition of this year.

New tools to break down cars
In these days of time and accidents, not only win the car dealers.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered from a sneeze are reduced to a tent, where a patient must evaluate the damage suffered and which will be the cost of repair.
No sister is equal, and calculating the costs of parts and working time can be a long and complicated work.
The cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including human parts of work, can be estimated at two or three hours.
On the contrary, with the support of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of less than a minute.
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The service providers and solutions for the evaluation of sineests and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by their manufacturers, to further develop and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading sign; an 80% of the assessments are made with its products.
The other companies involved in the field of the processing and processing of information on the sector are GtkMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is very simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, trade director of Audadex, Spain works with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
In addition, the number of data to be processed does not stop increasing, until there have been released versions in the last five years, varied and motorizations than in the previous five years.
As a new car goes to the market, these companies are forced to work.
It's a very expensive job, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, each model has a "intelligent" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinch".
If it's a sales model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can last three or four months. Currently, Audadex has full information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that is traveling, they're over 99%.
To carry out documentation and the development of databases, Audadex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the US, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, over a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audadex invested EUR 90 million annually in developing these databases.
Each month it includes 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to use different uses and offer various products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries also have tools to manage waste parts or to calculate the van or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that informs about the value of users in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadex it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard solution for the testimonials, for experts.
Includes cars, motors and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it includes repair times estimated by the manufacturer or painting bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is €5.75, for customers who use it a little bit, a maximum of ten times a month.
After each insurance company, which makes thousands of claims, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it emerged from the assembly line only with its number of passengers.
AudaGlass concentrates on the months of the vehicles, and AudaSubatas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to ride by the vehicles declared your entire sister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analyses, or to know the deviations by model marks.
For example, how many models of a particular brand have been passed by the workshop because of aberrations or how many serious sinisters have suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Trade, among other things, Gt estimate, which will also be intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Innsa group founded in 1971 as a service provider and damage assessment solutions, ownership or maintenance of the car
The Gt Tax Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 it accounted for EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, their process of internationalization began, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources from the company 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global weighting of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informationex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, a 3.3 per cent higher than in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter EUR 19.1 million, a 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solar Group was worth $1,000 million in Bolsa, and its actions now cost a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has grown in the New York Bolsa and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Download by Internet of accidents cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars as motor vehicles or special vehicles.
The operation was estimated at EUR 59.5 million for an 85% of society's capital, which could be extended by the remaining 15% year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to their customers, with the possibility of accessing a large international market.
This valuation and purchase service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, discounts and professional sellers who must be registered before they start performing operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of passengers has been given down cannot be recycled, but it can be used as a rest of certain parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be given high even though they have been given down after some terrible management.
Budget to take four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audadex ensures that the user receives a budget in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the replacement, create the budget and generate the budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less likely to be more responsive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 totals, 137 motorcycles, 78 vehicles and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with Internet connection is needed to use it.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired by its port number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user may include variables such as the price of the job, recharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the target orientation does not include estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the client can finance.
Currently, the company Audadex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics come with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and give it back to see the inner face.
