Norway's Recife: Is this the world's coolest fish?
Norway's five million people enjoy the highest standard of living, not just in Europe, but in the world.
Could the country's secret success be linked to some of the local fishing grounds?
Take the past piano selection.
Place these in the middle of the congregation in the form of a bad, dirty football.
Leave me a week.
Now you have one of the big Norwegian tattoos that's gonna poison your face. You're in a raspberry taste.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There's a car, a great place, and this rain, it always depends on the air.
Rakfisk is a plant that has been planted for a year, depending on how much you love coral fish.
When it's dark and the air is cold, the Norwegians gather here for a festival called the greatest meal.
The full-time local editor on the program's agenda and the word "Rakfisk Generali" Howard Halvarsen says, "Put this in the tree, then you bring an aqueduct."
People around us eat little fish and drink a lot.
Havard says, "Some people love aquavit more than a rapist."
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can get away from crossing the bridge, it's not bad, but it's a little bit different from a sushie language after a long bus ride.
Rakfisk Norvec is a very different example of the wintertimes expected in water and rivers that fish do not spend in the summer.
Then he will be taken out of his bosom, and he will be taken out of his mother's womb, and he will certainly be taken to his mother's womb, and he will be taken to his mother's womb.
Just a generation ago, thousands were forced to leave their countries to find work in Norway, and most of them moved to the United States.
Now the tension is expanding rapidly - more than 13% of jobs, high wages and a complex system of care.
In the near future, people from Switzerland, who are far richer than Norway, are paying for their work.
Rakfisk represents something important, even though Norvech's history is a little complicated, it's a part of life.
Among the worst food you can buy.
But you give $9 ($14) to a small bar or a sandwich.
The Norwegians don't come to the world's day, and most people like that.
We want to talk about the name of the 77 men, women and children who killed their children in the last 77 years.
Instead, it's called "22th of days" for killing.
The Norwegians are forced to believe that one of them will be able to commit such a crime and murder in their developing countries.
Norway's rich today, since the 1970s, has seen the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But Petrol isn't the only reason we're so good," she says.
We are, as you say, a wonderful people.
It's English, like most people here.
We're not very attractive, we don't like fun.
Norway's oil economy has been very carefully managed – the small percentage of money coming from the industry is focused on the benefit of all future generations.
While the rest of the people had no money, during the years of the global financial crisis, Norway's accounts were often tied together.
"We're happy as long as we're able to walk the mountains," says Anna.
"And rafflesk when you eat," he adds with a comfortable breakfast.
I'm standing on the map and waiting for something to eat, and I've eaten enough raffic.
Now there's a very different thing about an early hamburger and a nicer tattoo.
But tonight there's more of that coke than that fish.
One of the many places I've stayed in is that of a hotel that's cool at night, and there's the best lodgers here, and maybe they're playing the most violent game in the world.
There's a live television connection on a reverse paper server with Rakfisk tobacco.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"How much money do you have for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Our mountains are here, Howard."
There's breakfast, there's coffee.
A man's falling out of the canal, maybe in the influence of the aquavit.
Or maybe all these fish smells.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces a tough start.
While the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, is preparing to take over the office, he is looking forward to the violence that will Grant faced from BBC and his people.
Mexico's traffic is particularly bad right now.
In the best of times, a difficult city, since the day of the Passover, it has been the reason for the variety of mother-in-law routes that have taken place between a nation and a nation.
But not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching a mechanic.
On Friday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will take over the national administration.
Opposing a vicious task.
Philippe Calderon, who has a good economic performance in Mexico, continues to manage, but is under the control of an estimated 60,000 drug deaths in six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto told Uval Ofiste U.S. President Barack Obama this week, "There's a big word to the people of Mexico for reducing the government's violence."
I'm going to call for a new security strategy that will make us reach this goal.
Before the U.S. presidential election, Mr. Pena Nieto chose his country's first political experiment in Mexico.
The majority of the presidents, the larger ones, are divided into new leaders in this old area.
An open-minded man.
For example, it's remembered with love in the town of Valle del Bravo.
The people who live here are proud to see that he inspired tourism in his workshop and created the subterfuge.
You can go from Mr. Pena Nieto's new cars to get to the city, and I'm making a great deal of progress on the roads that have been changed.
In addition, the name-plattches are based on the modern sports center and the interactive climate change museum.
"We look at him to bring about true and lasting change," says Mr. Pena Nieto's friend and member of the State Congress of the PRI party, Gabriel Olvera Hernández.
In particular, we hope that there will be an interesting and real change in our country, especially in terms of security and economy.
After 81 years of unlimited power, the PRI was launched by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that he had a lot of expectations about Enrique Pena Nieto 12 years after he was outside the office of the president of Los Pinos.
And the mayor refuses to want the new president to make his own wish.
An open-minded man calls himself in a beautiful country.
He's a great government man and a man who listens to everyone.
But that's not the idea that many people on the other side of the country have to do with their old choices.
In the Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the city, there could be no more contact with the streets of Valle del Bravo's park.
It's a bathroom in Mexico City in many ways under the highway.
And the problems of the beginning are difficult and civil.
This year's army was called to help fight drug dealers working in areas and especially against women.
A large-scale bomb was fired by the woman's body in just two years of being killed in an empty space near the burial area.
While Mr. Pena Nieto was elected, more than 1,000 women were killed in the Mexican state, much more than Ciudad Juarez, known for his violent crimes against women.
Mr. Pena Nieto says he couldn't handle the problem of a woman's murder until it was the best way to get Mr. Pena Nieto.
Worse yet, they blame him for not seeing his authority.
In a typical concrete house in the Kahne Valley, Irinaa Buendia is trying to fight with the old eyes when she shows me pictures of Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the case, Mariana died in 2010.
But he believes he's killed by his family partner.
"When I went home, it was like a desert," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were traces that showed that he was being beaten, and he had already begun to suffer from death.
When his mother repeated her story, Mariana looked down from the wall, with a single word on it: Justice.
However, this family has been told that they have been completely rejected.
The people of the country treated me like an old-fashioned man who said, "I'm an old man."
What they want is to simply accept what people say and close their eyes.
"But it can't be true when there's so much injustice and weakness," he says.
President Pena Nieto comes with heavy responsibilities on Friday.
For the past six thousand years, our families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico and promised to give them priority during the new regime.
The Prime Minister of Congress, Olvera, says in Valle del Bravo, "He's a president like my hope."
But it's the most scary of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza.
Bradley Mann didn't complain about the bad behavior, the lawyers say.
Fighters are trying to resist Bradley Manning's mishandling ideas.
The fight is focused on Manning's military in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case if Manning's arrest is serious.
It is estimated that each of the thousands kept secret documents will be played.
On Friday, the soldiers tried to indicate that they had lost more than one chance of complaining about the bad behaviors that Bradley Manning had experienced during his military surveillance.
Before the U.S. trial in Maryland, Judge Ashden Fein Manning pointed out that during his nine-month stay in Quantico, Virginia, he did not show a complaint about the poor record of weekly visits.
One day came after a statement that Manning was thinking of the prosecution while watching the trial, in order to end Manning's case, because his prison sentence was severe and his sentence was so severe that he was punished enough.
The army arrested in 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while performing a mission in Iraq.
Material later released by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never proved Manning's source of information.
On Friday's stand, Fein joined Manning in the form of a meeting of the members, followed by the meeting of the Quantico Army, which was held in a prison sentence increased from June 2010 to Nisan 2011.
The members asked Manning questions and noted their findings.
When asking questions about the forms on Friday, Manning's guards indicated that the conduct was "professional" and that all of the tests were "many professionals".
Forms don't make a complaint about bad behavior, but members ask Manning about the right behavior, says Fein.
He said he wanted to express his concern about Manning, and he said he was talking about the concerns of the visiting members and told them that he would be directed to them, but they didn't record them.
Manning said: "The truth is that it will not come to you, nor will it bring you any interpretation."
Justice Dr. Denise Lind de Manning asked why he did not complain at the 2011 meeting of the Council of Ministers of the European Communities about any conduct that would distort the content of his speech months ago.
Manning confirmed that the purpose of the meeting was to "prevent progress" and that the status of the event was to be submitted.
Ordu said that he and others had put him in a restricted position of six to protect himself and others.
"I wanted something to know I was good, and I wanted to get out of POI... to enjoy a quality of life that I'm looking forward to," said Manning.
Manning was arrested in Iraq on Friday and reported to Kuveyt about two months before he was transferred to the Marine Base Quantico prison in Virginia in 2010.
He said he was thinking about suicide in Kuwait and he was there once because of the heat.
He said he'd be stressed if he wouldn't be allowed to know what he was and what he was in the outside world.
"My world has been reduced to Camp Arafjon," said Manning on Friday.
I thought I'd die in that coffee.
Manning said most of his days to Quantico, at least 21 hours, and for more than 23 hours, were spent alone in a small cell.
The man said he was given only one bed, a bed, a ring between his fingers, a little clothes and his eyes.
She tried to move because she said that it was contrary to rules that were consistent within the day and even extended.
Man said he always slept with the light that came out of his eye.
When he came back at night, he said, "If the guards had not seen his face, they would have raised him up and turned him back."
Manning's lawyer, Ocak, was in charge of the conduct of Manning in 2011.
Manning was transferred to the prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in Nisan 2011.
At the same time, a statement made by Judge Manning on Friday in his statement on Friday, asked him about the forced night in Quantico, which was forced to fall asleep at night, and the guards were forced to stand up in front of the other prisoners in the morning.
He said he wasn't given a chance to beat himself up during the man's count.
On Friday's question, the judge said that Manning had to shoot a battalion that could catch him, but no one ordered him to shoot.
Manning said he was forced to sleep the night before, because of his desire to show that there was no danger for him on Friday afternoon.
Manning said that he didn't do it by using a stick or a finger between his fingers, but he didn't.
Manning said that that night he was taken from his fingers and eyes by his fingers.
The prosecutor hopes that at least the trial will be taken into account by the prosecutor and that the sentence will be reduced to a large extent in the case of a military trial pending in the beginning of our year.
The defense said that Manning would accept the crime in smaller cases and fight in the most serious crimes.
The situation is expected to continue at the end of this week, so they are expected to discuss the fact that the guards' custody is guaranteed.
Pentagon Manning indicated that all the maximum custody courts in Quantico were held in accordance with the rules.
Those who are against Manning, who are involved in helping the enemy, who have been posted on the Internet in an wrong way by greed, who are spreading national defence information, and who have a lot of property or records.
If the judge wears all of my belongings, he can face the prize.
Mexican American identity crisis
Many people say that because of the lack of opportunity here, it's hard to leave Mexico.
The Mexicans are in a prison camp; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, says
Navarret says Mexican Americans are interconnected between the two worlds.
I was on a trip to Mexico City on a very difficult journey, and I was surprised to see that.
The signs showed two classes: one for "Mexicanos" (the Mexicans), the other for "Extraneros" (the Japanese)
I stayed there for a few seconds. I wasn't sure where I was going.
I've been called "Mexico" all my life because I grew up in the center of California.
At this ethnic stage, my friends in Boston call them "Irland" or my friends in New York say "Italian" to themselves.
Then I decided in Mexico America.
But it was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's country, there was no need for stano or terra.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, I'm good enough to manage both sides of a conversation in this language.
But I don't have their local words, and I can't save from my American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport and went back for Extraneros.
I thought about it when I visited White Saray to meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto this week in Mexico.
In my day, the leaders of the two countries were always the same, as they were, moving, drug trafficking and trafficking.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about growth in Mexico, which is why it is not possible to stay in Mexico until the Mexicans are trying to enter the United States now.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade blog in the form of the European Union in North America.
She promised that she would continue to fight the drug cartels of Mexico, even if she didn't suggest anything to Pena Nieto.
For Mexico, it's full of confusion and feelings about the United States.
Most Americans probably didn't think about the fact that the United States persecuted Mexico in 1848 and forced their leaders to shoot half of their villages.
But not minutes, there's reminders for Mexicans who have been thinking about centuries everywhere.
That's why when an U.S. competent U.S. official said a little bit about Mexico, you'll start to hear complaints about the fact that the American community is in the press and among the elites.
And Montezuma's kids will go to war.
And yet, it's more than 35 million people living in the United States who are really violent for Mexico.
Do you want to talk about feelings you don't have?
There's so much.
There are people who have won and lost in Mexico who have created the country and who have not created it.
The only reason that a lot of people who live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, who live in one of our summer trees, may have to stay outside of Mexico and go north.
And most of the time, this guy's sleeping in a profile -- he's wearing hair, little education, a poor village, vs.
We are their patrons, and We are their patrons.
It's not Mexico.
And even though we're not living in America now, we're going to good schools and we're never gonna ignore the fact that what we've been doing is not in Mexico.
Our identity may be unknown at times, but our loyalty is clear.
It's the United States.
We also realize that most Mexicans don't like us.
That's a sense of honor.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating phenomenon, and they look up to us as if we're a subgroup that's not quite Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationships with Mexico are never as strong as it is.
Our presence is all about failure in their eyes.
If our families didn't succeed in Mexico, they wouldn't go.
And now we couldn't find ourselves in the back of a bad bitch, who lives well in the United States, but they're still lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, came to the United States as a legal child, reminds me that there is a difference between Mexicans and Mexicans because they are more likely to be Mexicans and Mexicans to be involved in this.
Although he is a member of the United States, he is considered a part of the two countries.
At the same time, most of the people I know don't feel like two Mexican Americans.
We like to listen to Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You're getting the best of both worlds, but you're not proud of anyone.
We're looking like Americans in Mexico.
We are recognized as Mexicans in the United States.
Now, as I have learned on my journey to strengthen the relationship, some Mexican leaders and some whites want to re-connect with Diaspora.
The Americans of Mexico want to run as "members" in the past in Mexico to show their concern to the United States.
We're going to have to tell the Americans what a beautiful country we're visiting, and we're going to have to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
We've got a lot of feelings.
And we're not sure that most of us are a great country with tomorrow's inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence.
I'm afraid you're the only friends.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for their behavior in Mexico a hundred years ago, then some Mexican Americans still have to admit that they still have to be proud of the treatment that has been done to their families in the near future.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
The old wars, the new Middle East
It could be an unlikely basis for a fiery conflict between Israel and Hamas.
Could there be a constant conflict between the Arab and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood pressure shows that such a hope is empty.
Among the endless disputes that arose about whom he began, he turned to a number of buildings, killed more than 140 Palestinians and six Israel as civilians, and the first time from Gaza came near the great city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Kuduz.
Although the Israelites and the Philistines may have been tired of their earlier encounters, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arabians carried away the parts of the land into the air, and the Philistines and the children of Israel caught them in the field.
Maybe it's more blood than their fight.
However, there are reasons to think that this could corrupt their killers.
What a waste of war!
At first glance, it's hard to get out of it right now.
21 Although the fires that were approved in November continued, the war on both sides of the week strengthened the arrows.
Since 2007, Muslim leaders of Hamas, who have managed Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have forced the Israelites to return to Gaza.
Despite killing some of their leaders and keeping Gaza’s 1.7 million people in one of the world’s worst and most powerful villages, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
Of course, Hamas Philistines now win the other part of the mighty Philistines' war in West Syria, led by the great Philistines at Fatah.
In addition, Hamas' leaders can also determine the outcome of their time.
In the Arab world, Hamas became strong and rich friends as the Muslims gained the upper hand.
In one time Israel's closest Muslim defender, Turkey's most reborn regional power was the goal of Hamas, and so was Qatar, one of the richest and dynamics of the Korfez countries.
The happy Hamas people say that the ruling party of Hizbullah's army around Israel is headed north from Lebanon to Syria, and that the Muslim school is headed north, which can turn the Middle East into Syria, and that Hamas' security is threatened by the king.
After all, it changed the height of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the largest and most important part of the Arab countries in the south-west region of Israel.
In 2011, there was very little time left for Hamas of Hüsnü Kingdom for 30 years to lead Egypt.
On the contrary, it's more about the cousins of Brother Hamas and their leaders.
The future diplomat Hamas, Israel and the Americas can be described as an actor who can't even stop.
In the meantime, Israel's leaders will produce a completely different result.
As a soldier, he was put back in Hamas' box.
Israel's Demir Kubbe proved the value of the anti-fraud system, and many of Hamas' faces were destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep more quietly for a while.
From a diplomatic point of view, most European countries have accused Hamas of starting the last violent events.
After all, Israel, in particular, grew up under the leadership of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who did not see the dispute in large terms.
Although the rockets from Gaza have killed nearly 30 Israel since 2004, Israel has been able to save a few of the Israeli bombers who have fled to West Syria, a part of the Palestinian country in question.
Mr. Netanyahu, who is still with the armed group of Avigdor Lieberman during the 22nd Ocak election, is pleased.
Why would you be surprised that these false Philistines had given up their own kingdoms?
If they really manage West Şeria, won't they fire rockets like their passengers in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and get them out of their heads.
Maybe the reporters will win, and the Arab East can change their accounts.
When the Muslims conquered Egypt, and the rest of Israel were very few in love with them, they fought with their own forces in the homes.
Israel's defense belt is bigger than the Arab neighboring alliance.
Initiating war with the local superpowers will not help to improve the economy of the new Arab governments.
Pragmatik Mr. Mursi worked with Barack Obama to keep a fire that looked good, and maybe they could start something.
The Israelites were to take a long look at the valley.
While the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, the destruction of Palestinians from their own rights this week, like a bus in Tel Aviv, makes it impossible for Israelis to spread in areas under business.
In the Jewish state, pressure is already undermining democracy and the Arab spirit is taking on democracy as it grows.
Every few years, blood duties against Gaza will reach a diplomatic level that is growing.
There is a need for an outsider on both sides
On both sides, most of the world outside and the reasonable people in this newspaper are represented by the two states that represent Israel's territory for security.
In short, a small hope in a valley will give the deaf a little more strength to those who are struggling with this goal.
Now it's better to convince Gaza, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, that it's going to stop the flow of arms, that it's better to convince Hamas that the Jewish government has changed its views on land and that it's going to agree with Kurdus.
Foreign Arabs must also force Hamas and Fatah to join.
This will be much more effective than the global government proposal in the BM in the area of the formation of a Palestinian government.
Mr. Obama is also playing a role in bringing Israel to the table.
For the first time, he refused to pursue his own struggle plan.
It seems we don't want to get in in the white Saray.
This pain doesn't make any progress.
America has a life-threatening Middle East.
This would mean an agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
The cigarettes are simply packaged in Australia.
Cigarettes and diseased organs are placed on single green boxes for all brands
Australia's smoking and the world's first laws on smoking and the whole world have been introduced, leaving brand logos and colors in place, the emerging images of disease organs and the smoking of children and babies who are sick because of smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the same small type of label names will be printed in the same small type of label that will occur during the day of the coming Summer.
I'm the only one who's able to pack the fabric in this world.
Australia's federal government aims to discourage young people from smoking by cutting off their addictions.
This is based on studies that show that people will never start smoking until they are 26 years old.
"You can see that all of the children’s companies have been trying to sell their brands even since very early in life," says Tanya Plibersek, a federal health officer who took advantage of the work that showed children’s gambling logo to be a princess.
Australia has one of the world’s lowest smoking habits and changes will have little effect on women of many nations, but other countries consider similar steps.
They've built a strong lobby against the laws of the whole industry.
He said all the companies would support their trade if they bought karaoke, and they would open the way to more cheap and more accessible cigarettes.
From British American Tobacco Australia, Scott McIntyre said, "There will be consequences that Yasama doesn't really care about."
Those from China and Indonesia will bring more and more of these products to sell in the streets of Australia.
Others say it increases the work of the law.
A small family company from Zico Import Pty Ltd to Sandra Ha's cigarette boxes, nearly two months ago in British American Tobacco, England, British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, and Japan Tobacco Australia, left the office of higher courts.
Zico says he sold more than 6,000 to his shopping malls, and he's waiting for a new stock.
It's a good job for us.
Scientists say that social media is popular in the demographic goal of the potential action plan.
A number of Australia's laws have been moved by the whole trader after he has banned television advertising and sports sponsorship and wants most salesmen to keep their cigarettes out of sight.
In Australia, local companies and websites have posted online advertisements, but they can't limit extra sites to the sea.
Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University, said, "If you're on the whole market and this little window is left to identify your products, it's the place you need to share."
Freeman's brands indicate that there is an increase in social media incentives such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Did this Marlboro cigarette really come into the hands of a civil servant and a video player, or was it a marketing company in it?
British American Tobacco Australia said it was intended to comply with new rules despite the fact that the industry was failing to sell it.
Entürstri moved to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay money to read from the new legislation, which states claim that despite the fact that no country has been legally restricted by the World Ticaret Organization in Australia, the trade has been unduly restricted.
A WTO decision is likely to emerge in mid-2013.
Plibersak said the government had made talks with other countries considering package decisions.
In 2001, it was Canada's first country to warn.
Now they have spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In England, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, there are several more laws.
Most people in Australia are reading from the tobacco industry.
Images don't affect me.
I'm coming to see them.
When he bought a pack of eight-square pictures, Victor El Hage said, "Take a cigarette and put it in place,"
If I have to be honest, there's only one reason I'm leaving, and that's my little girl.
In Sydney's center, James Yu, who runs the King's store all over, said it's hard to block the tracks of the single type package.
Yu said, "I've got an hour ahead of me, and now I've got four hours."
He said, "The people had to write it down. All right, we're done and we're gonna close the store."
Fasting Is So Bad in a World
I spent five hours in the air without waiting for another flight when we had mechanical difficulties on Saturday, and when we had to wait for another flight.
So it took me a lot of time to think about it.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Even if it's very expensive, books, magazines, and iPhones to wait in the air for a half-day flight (even if I don't talk about the whole deal).
But in a further way, some academics and child development tend to slow down experts.
They're saying it's sometimes normal for us and our kids to have a tantrum.
It forces the brain to go to interesting dancers, and maybe it's increasing creativity.
And most of us don't try the benefits of smoking because we're connected to each other from a screen.
So we have to open the hole to warm up?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'm going back to this.
First of all, I imagined that it would be a new challenge to be able to cope with more empty time than many people.
Peter Toohey, who is a professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University in Canada, says that it is not.
He said, "There's really a long story to go."
There's a Latina wall letter from the first century on which to burn in Pompeii's walls.
How do we know how to be patient?
The problem is that these are widely recognized and discussed, says John D. Eastwood, a psychologist at the York University of Canada, Ontario.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the opinion of a group of about 100 people in the room, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were identified as a "study but satisfying activity" that they did not interfere with.
The thing that separates you from poverty is that you don't want to be busy, but you don't want to be.
He doesn't have to do anything about poverty, he said.
He said, "It's a failure of the pace of the pace with the slow pace and the slowness of the time."
It can be much the same with depression.
But Professor Eastwood, who may be concerned, said that only those who are depressed are in a position to see the problem around or the world, but those who are depressed see it as their own.
Sometimes we just think we're tired when we're living in a concentration camp.
Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier attempt by participants in the work "Science of Non-Innocent Recognition" that was published in the Psychological Science Statements Report on the Month of the Year.
Some groups heard a TV program that was very loud and no interest in the room, others heard it very little at a very low level, but they never heard a third group.
Those who heard low-level television reported more stress than the other two groups, they lived without concentration, but they were not sure why it was, and they were involved in it.
Mark J. Fenske, one of the writers of the work and the University of Goelph in Ontario, said that when you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, it is hard to focus on it.
On the other hand, when you read something boring, it might help you not to push your attention away from the area of music, like looking at bad tools in a factory band.
In fact, it can make it more difficult to fight it by making it more physically difficult for people to do so, which is usually a sign of stress.
"It shows that children who are allowed to move are more learning and getting more information than children who are forced to stop acting," said Professor Fenske.
We're all trying hard at some point, the night of my flight, a monotonous speaker, a hot movie.
But some people think I'm more patient than others.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a "Creation of the Age" to help measure this.
I have a lot of questions, I don't have time to do anything.
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at West Florida University, said that researchers have found that it is more frequent in the hearing of girls than in girls who need more and more.
But usually they're in a very poor group.
In 1991, Professor Reed Larson, a professor of human and population development at the University of Illinois, conducted a seven-to-one trial with nearly 400 adults and their husbands.
He found that 32 percent of adults were in school and paid only when 23 percent were not in school.
On the other hand, they said they had three percent of the victims.
Professor Larson said that now 21 years later, he knows that the percentages of depression will be higher or lower.
But he said that he knew that what children and adults wanted to do was not being given more control over what they wanted to do to the elderly, because he knew it was "the turn of the turn of energy."
That's why I'm going back to my first question: is it good for a man to walk?
Sometimes no, because research shows that as a way of reducing people's risk of falling into physical danger, gambling, or drug use.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who worked more than two years on the subject, said that many philosophers and writers dispute the link between the complexity and creativity.
Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at N.Y.U., said, "It's like telling you that your brain needs to do something else."
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you run and use this energy to play guitar and eat, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it can make you happy in a short walk, but it won't be in a long walk.
So if you give him an iPad when your child is pregnant, he can't be pregnant anymore, but he doesn't know how to have fun or how to fix himself, Professor Fenske said.
And he said, "This will be transferred from one state to another."
Your child doesn't only know how to enjoy himself, but in other areas, he'll control himself more.
I don't think we really want to be happy.
We shouldn't be too tired.
Rather, our goal should be to be content far away from having a constant flow of energy and technology.
Professor Eastwood was involved.
"We're going to need more patience, but it's gonna be painful, and it's going to be connected to something that doesn't make sense," he said.
He said, "What people really are looking for is a way to get out of business and enjoy leisure time."
He said, "It's hard to find ways to be busy when you're busy in an area where we're constantly being warned."
No Senaryo for the New Marihuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in southern Colorado, faced with the crime of taking a few pieces of marijuana and pipe to drink.
One day, Mr. Orozco Elul said he and his friends were stopped in Lamar, near the Kansas border.
After finding Marihuan in a police car, Mr. Orozco received a call for a small criminal, transportation and drug dealer's vehicle and a court history.
"We were treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is that someone?
The answer to the law of hundreds of small drug addicts in weeks is largely due to the lack of determination of the small amount of marijuana to be used for the fun of Colorado.
Hundreds of minor criminal marijuana cases are already closed here and in Washington State, which has approved a similar procedure.
Police stations have stopped the crime for small amounts of transport to be legalized in the weeks ahead of us.
However, in more occupied regions of Colorado, the prosecutors have vowed to carry out the case in a decisive manner and still call on people to be brought to trial for their conduct.
At the same time, several cities from the Denver Bay to the Western Mountains are using games to prevent the opening of their shops in the areas of marijuana.
Aurora's police chief, Daniel J. Oates, who was born in Denver, said, "It's growing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen later,"
And the editors in Washington State are losing their heads.
And they're looking for a license system for production, sale, distribution and sale for the last 1st of April 2013.
They say that Colorado is in front of most of the state for the preparation of marijuana in my fun.
"They will have a more orderly market in Colorado, and therefore will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, the Inquiry Control Centre in Washington State.
But Mr. Smith went on to say that he can't do more than suggest where or what the system is going to work.
"There is no real example to follow," he said.
The law given by Washington I-502 will enter into force on 6 December, and the country's licensing system will leave for a year of uncertainty, but the legal transfer.
In the meantime, there are serious mechanical issues to be resolved, such as how to "appropriate access" to the licensed marijuana directive by the schools, parks, child parks or childcare centres.
Ben Livingston, a Newly Established Research Group, said, "It's no harder to find a licensee in any place than in the cities, especially the Great City Area of Seattle."
In November 21, Chief Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail saying that a 21-year-old lawyer in the city would not blame little marijuana for anyone, and that the police would let people commit these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would lay down the walls of the city that would repair the developers of marijuana and trace the drug dealers and sellers again.
Ken Buck, head of the region in North Colorado, represents a more recent visit.
After he played, the office said that it would continue to monitor traffic cases as a way to force users to be treated.
Now, when 119 people are accused of carrying two or less marijuana, many face other charges.
Mr. Buck said in a statement, "There is a need to open up cases of crimes committed in our office when they are alive."
Even in places like the Red Sea Region, where the moons had refused to enter marijuana.
The biggest city in the province is the police in Grand Junction no longer accuse the adults of small coins.
The regional head of the region, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision but decided not to close the cases pending at the same time.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to apply your law until it changes," he said.
It would never have been easy to bring fun marijuana into the government and the legal system, even though 55 percent of those who took the lead in Colorado were supported by gambling.
And there's a deep gap between local authorities about the country's great green economy.
Marihuana's lawyer representing lawyers and Marihuana's Laws Reform Organization's local spokesman, Sean McAllister, says it's "a global barrier" to the leaders of the region.
He said, "They spent a lot of their lives accusing people, so they don't accept it as legitimate."
In small quantities, the first countries to be treated as alcohol in marijuana are prepared to have a national test bag for drug abuse in Colorado and Washington.
Lawyers and state officials are waiting to be transferred from the federal government, which plans to close up the sale and execution of marijuana as a federal offence while planning a new limited sale for legal sale.
The convicted marijuana lawyers expect the Court to be dismissed.
Despite the high profile arrests of patients and sellers, doctors in marijuana have largely allowed the federal government to operate marijuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 instances.
In Obama's administration, former drug policy speaker Kevin A. Sabet said that it is likely that drug agents will not shut the doors to capture a small drug bag but that they will not be allowed to allow their businesses to enjoy the pleasure of the country, which is regulated by new laws.
He doesn't expect several cities in Colorado to move to federal offices.
Even before the election day, some local governments have accepted the debt payments of new marijuana stores, which are about a year later, to open up some local governments.
Last week, Montrose brought the city with a six-month stay, and it's probably our next week's reception.
The City Council member Bob Nicholson said, "We don't want to get into a state where this is a big federal problem,"
He used to play against the change in our area.
We're looking at the region that's playing against the situation.
There's too many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was kidnapped from Oxford because I was a writer
It's just that today's students don't get hurt because of the meetings.
I can't remember when I didn't dream of winning a place at Oxford University.
My father and my older brother, my brother and I, were both in a place where the world's best-known modern wine crown was at the Greek Semposium, where we had the freedom and tolerance of the environment, in a place that promoted freedom and tolerance.
But to read history at the end of the season, I collected my bags in two weeks at Worcester College, and I started my first scandal of life.
My father was lost and crying.
The friends are surprised.
The house told me that I was away from my friends in the room on my standard day.
The writer A. Wilson heard that I was separated because I was forced to drink from the crack.
It's a little less funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away, 'cause I stood up against the systematic sale and fear.
Not because my name's a little weird or because I'm coming from a private school.
I was only offended for one reason, and the fifth time I understood this word, it was also the head and the barbaric: my father, my cousin Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Thatcher, was a high-profile speech by Margaret Thatcher, and I supported the Mahabazaers.
You can ask why I'm open to this.
According to recent reports, new genetically-centred students are starting out of similar treatments.
In Oxford, a group of homosexuals, intelligent people, and ethnic minorities have been subjected to the same hatred and hatred over the past week.
Corpus Christi College's third-class partner room (JCR) members said that because of political encounters, they were "simply left alone in an active way, subjected to personal persecution and felt that they did not want to."
They want to make a release in the university's Equal Opportunities Committee so that meetings can be released free of charge.
The new BBC Two documentant Wonderland also did not help: Young, Parlak and right-wing reporters seemed strange and neo-Nazi about learning politics.
The OUCA, the former president of the University of Oxford, showed Joe Cooke a silver-colored suit with Rolls-Royce and a silver headstone.
In other universities, college students say they are treated as "the world's pass" for higher education.
Luke Black, 20, Nottingham University of Universities, the United States' assistant, told a Poster newspaper that "there is a left-wing gap in universities."
"People think we're like Bullingdon Club before we meet us."
Historian Samuel Roberts, in Corpus Christi, who takes the lead in a better defense, says that such an environment is "no pleasure," but Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA, says that the other elected members of the JCR are a violation of their right to the right.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere and the well-being of its members," he says.
In the first few weeks in Oxford, I was one person's fault.
In 1986, at 18 years of age, I went as an unsatisfying prisoner.
He was at the hottest time against the party.
In the first year, Margaret Thatcher, an ex-educated student at the university, gave a joke in order to refuse his prestigious degree.
This atmosphere frightened Stalin's side.
During the first few days of the first week, I watched the pain I was going through when my students were socializing with one another and with my teacher's duties.
I'd like to see you come back and see what you've done without seeing the students get involved with the college students.
I was brought to the top panelrooms of the state-of-the-art political training of the media, the private sector and the government, against South Africa, which was separated from the government.
The first 18th century was about translating French texts into English, and I was not prepared for those who came later.
Professor Harry Pitt said, "Mr. Wyatt, please turn the first paragraph,"
That's what I've been through.
Pitt, a little man like the face pasta hammock.
"Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?"
The other students of the license were on their way.
He hurt the eyes behind my eyes.
"In an empty time, if you're not very busy with socialism, I suggest you take basic French lessons," Pitt said.
I walked back to my room with a rough picture.
That night at the university, I sat alone at the dinner table, and then I felt a little nervous.
This was a second-class English student named James, who identified himself as a member of the OUCA.
He said, "I know who you are."
I'm afraid so.
He's dealing with anyone who's suspected of being a writer.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that my father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most teachers act like the first grade student's working party's wrong.
Then, in a local bar, I tried to make a terrible dance.
I insisted on not participating in anything that Mrs. Thatcher said.
This was proof of tactical failure.
A first-class PPE student in Eton, ironically, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist doll,"
You're called.
The other students kept themselves.
I was wrong, I was wrong.
Someone asked, "How are the prostitutes sexing?"
They're attacking each other, aren't they?
I felt like I had sex before I made liberals in the sixties.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people with the same idea only when it's dark?
Would I go back to my work party and print my birthdays?
It was three years before I was born as a full-fledged, single-eyed lion.
Professor Norman Stone was the only open author of modern history at the university.
He was also hated by both the writer and the foreign politician of Thatcher and one of the writers of the text.
He was very little there.
Because he was small and far away from there, and it was due to the necessity of Marksist's historic experience.
In 1997, Ankara, Turkey, became a professor at the University of Sciences.
He said to me, "You're not going to be happy there."
From Oxford, I started going to my grandfather's house in London, and I got a better look at my big city friends and my family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and told him why.
He couldn't believe it.
All political talks were held in circles during his own time.
He said, "But it's the best place in the world."
They won't do this, not between my ghosts.
Even my Communist friends always had perfect behavior.
It's starting to blow your eyes off.
Give me a chance.
I'm sure it's all a joke.
If you leave, my heart will break.
I was losing my emotional stability from my frequent visits to London.
A guy who's been a spy, and he's been snooping his faith.
I decided to do the same thing when I told you that I'm a very serious enemy of mine during the next week's course.
In a way, I acknowledged that I was ashamed of my advice and that my brain was breaking up, and I told them, "You idiots."
It's too short to ask.
My dad took a glass of tea to the roof of Oxford's career.
Then, every week, Murdoch wrote two poems.
My door was locked.
I was in, and five minutes later, those who were behind me broke up.
When they left, I prepared a doll and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a piece of shit.
But no one in the 18-year-olds should be so afraid and disappointed in an educational system.
Even more tragic, Oxford's 14 presidential appearance and a sense of equality and freedom of thought are behind the day.
Match two objects of the same type in Trabzon
Trabzon left the second class with the right-hand side of Yomra.
When two women who had been found dead in the wilderness disappeared, the village of Shavan was about to cross the way.
One of the two women who were missing in the cell was caught.
The rain was active at Yomra's high altitude at 15 a.m.
By the time he moved his second train, the Second River was located about 200 metres below water.
Abraham Karss, one of the villages near the end of his village, who had not begun working to inform the authorities of their arrival, "The road is closed for 3 hours.
We live the same thing in every heavy rain.
We informed the authorities, but they didn't leave.
They're having a party.
We're living this stress every year.
When the trees reach the level, they go out with water."
BY AWAKE! WRITER IN SOUTH CENTURY C.E.
The President of the House of Lord Abraham said that one of the two women, who had been lost in the field at the end of the year, had reached the age of two, kept on calling the other.
He remembered that the mother of the two women, who had gathered in the valley of Tashdeen, had survived because of her right hand, which had been active in the day, had died, and had been buried in the water.
Sagerogul, who said that his call work for hours late in the morning began again in the early hours, said, "The work of the Belledian machines was finally reached by a relative of ours under the ground, and the call continues."
He added that he had lost the effect of the rain, that he had left his place in the sunlight, that he had lost someone, and that the work on the underground roads had been carried out peacefully.
The missing women were informed that the road to the outlying village had been opened during the search.
"CHANGE ON THE PHONE"
In the village of Tashdeen, in the village of Trabzon, on the right, they are trying to escape the wounds of the cell and the breath of the breath.
He said, "The rain is not as bad as the rain."
Tashkara, who said that he had destroyed the homes of many people during the rainy season, "We left the collection.
After that, there was such a mistake.
The lost comet and the source were gathering dust during the rainy season.
And then, when they returned to their homes, they were caught in a rage."
He added that there was electricity and that there was no water.
As for Hasan Selim, when he was 60 years old, he said, "If the water continued for an hour, it wouldn't have remained on the rocks."
It's a natural college that rewards success!
Of course, College provides students with a 100 percent chance of a bus with OYP success.
In terms of innovation and visual education, the Doga College, which has won education models in Turkey and the world, supports its successful students with a 400-year-old bus opportunity to capture the importance of the education that the T-MBA model applied to.
Only students with t-MBA, a high-licence program for students, applied at the University of Anadolou Colleges, begin with vocational training, and in the course of higher education.
For the past 3 years, Donga College, which has been in high school in SBS for the past 3 years, encourages and supports education by awarding success with its students' bus opportunities.
In the four-year-old Anadolles, which is applied by the T-MBA education model, the bus is changing from 5% to 100 percent, according to the student's success.
In the OYP 491 and above, the South College, which awarded students a percentage of 100 burs, provides a 50% chance for students between 481-490, 471-480 between 60 and 451-470.
Of course, the College is rewarded with burs in cases ranging from 321-450 OYP points to up to 40%.
Turkey's most successful students prefer t-MBA.
With the success of the SBS, Turkey's most successful students choose the T-MBA education model, which has won to Turkey and the world through the understanding of South College's youth and vision education.
Only a high-licence program for students with t-MBA, applied at the University of Anadolu Schools, begins in the course of higher education, and begins at the university and in life.
Students, Teachers, T-MBA Applications, Foreign Language, International Projects, Inter-Agency and Training and Social Skills are developing in the T-MBA Education Model, which provides the university's high-ranking licensing programmes.
The chances of nature's bursing in Oxford's conceptual camps are clear...
In the first year of the Oxford Quality School, which developed with the cooperation of the Oxford School, and tested its success in the first year of the SBS Turkish Championship, Oxford's concept model of education also changed from 2% to 75%.
Between 481 and 490 OYP, 75% of the students who received the OYP were awarded a scholarship, and 471-480 were awarded an opportunity to students who received the OYP between 60 and 451-470.
"I'm going to pay for what we've done for our students, and I'm going to pay for Turkey's future."
With students, it is always the bottom of what they're always proud of, and the CEO's success is about the opportunities of the bourgeois community, "The College aims to develop offspring that will achieve success in every area of life.
In this objective, we encourage our students to make better and better progress in their careers, from the academic field, from the construction, to the music.
As teachers, we know that each student has a different perspective.
The important thing is to find out what they have been able to do and improve their success by focusing on them.
Our students are acting with the knowledge that the investment we've been teaching is being made in Turkey's future, and we pay for all their success."
It's always good to win
Hope Davala said they left a hard fight behind. He said, "3p is not easy, but it's a pleasure to win."
Mr.Saray said it's a pleasure to start the season with the possibility of the G.Saray Supporters.
If they're in some parts of the Gaza Strip before the new season, they're in trouble with two cups, and they're in some parts of the Gaza Strip, and Davala says, "It's always good to win.
It's an active group of gas stations, but it's all easy for us to find after the hands we've found."
BURSA MACHI KOLAY OLMAZ
Davala, who added, "We have a strong bussport deposit now.
The games aren't easy to win.
We don't see any cracks in the bag as we've been accused of, and the gas station has proved it."
Who is considered foolish? How does he get it?
I'm going to try to give you a lot of attention and experience in dealing with the problems you've faced in the social security field, or whatever they're concerned about.
You're meeting hundreds of news in the field of social security and work in the field of visualization that our readers need.
From this, I'm going to bring you the most accurate, healthy and reliable news in the Journal of Health and in the hurriyet.com.tr.
First of all, I want to get a very loud silence file.
We'll take these letters in writing form, which will continue as sections.
In our letter, you can find answers to all questions about respect for your mother's lines.
You can send your questions to alipten@hurriyet.com.tr.
I'm going to be in the warm ghetto to answer you in the shortest time.
What's the amount of money?
MALULEN is able to meet the security requirements set out in the SGK Act to ensure that SSK and KUR, who are unable to work, lose at least 60 years of employment, are able to meet the security requirements identified by the SKK.
It is also possible for the people who have lost the ability to win in the community to be able to do their jobs, except those who are assigned to them.
Who are considered foolish?
I'm writing from the diyarbakr, my name is Mehmet Gültekin, I have 920 days insurance, and I have a military insurance plus 540 days plus 1460 days insurance.
Besides, I'm a kidney patient.
I'm connected to the diagnostic machine.
I'm still working on a job.
Can I have the moon of honor?
- May I have done it first, Mr. Mehmet?
You didn't specify the first time you were in the job.
But let us briefly consider how the moon will bind you.
Firstly, the most important condition in the law must be insurance for 10 years, and you must be a public press day of 1800 days.
In addition, you are considered to be ashamed when you are exposed to at least 60 percent of your work force or the result of the accident or disease.
But you're here because you're a diabetic patient, you're doing 60 percent of the conditions, because you don't have a month since you didn't complete the number of the 1800 press days.
We don't know how long you've been working.
Your 10-year-old and 1800-days will be connected to you as a month after you leave your job.
Ways to Win the Battle for Riches
Can't anyone have a 10-year-old, no-one who doesn't have the 1800s?
- The press payment rate has to be completed in the 1800s.
However, there is only one exception; it is linked to weakness, for those who are judged to be vulnerable to the constant care of another, and for those who are determined to meet the other conditions of ten years of absence of insurance.
What illnesses or disappointments will be changed in the areas in which we continue to write about the constant presence of the person in a safe place.
Status of people who are infected with dignity before starting to work
I'm Ahmet Güler.
When I took all the steps in the law of the SGK, they said, "You can't take credit for my illness before I get to work first."
I'm so mad.
Isn't that unfair?
How am I supposed to be mature?
- Ahmet Bey, you've written that you've managed all the steps taken in the law, but there's no need to have a disease that is based on the loss of work for the SSK and the law enforcement.
The moon of honor is not connected because you don't carry this condition.
However, you may be embarrassed when you have to carry a measure of ambiguity in your life insurance policy.
- I've got 3980 days, and I've been in insurance for 16 years.
It was detected by the SGK before I entered my office.
They said you wouldn't be ashamed of me.
What am I gonna do in this situation?
I'm not gonna be hungry.
Will you show me the way?
- Yeah, you're right.
You can't be rich.
But you know, the SGK law has a prescription.
So there are two cases before and after October 2008.
If you first started working before this date, while the SGK found that you were pregnant before you started working, you could have a minimum period of 15 years of insurance and a period of 3600 press days.
That's why we suggest you be in a monthly connection request by contacting the nearest SGK Manager.
Well, if you were on duty after the 2008 team, then you could have been in insurance for at least five years, and you could've had at least 3960 days of dignity, age and death insurance.
Should we get out of the job while we're on the run?
I'm still working as a driver in a business.
When I went to the hospital, he gave me a history of cancer.
I want to be rich.
Should I leave my job in this situation?
Can't I get to the moon before I leave?
I don't want to be unemployed until the moon is bound.
- You're right.
To give you a monthly connection, you need to leave your job.
However, before starting the month, you need to count the number according to your SGK law.
However, if you are grateful, the moon will be joined by other conditions.
It doesn't mean you're willing to give a month's connection before you're appointed. You're not at risk of being unemployed.
That's enough of your 1800 days for that.
When you go to SGK and you give me a wish to see my weakness, the SGK will love you for one of the patients who've grown up.
And when you bring your health care report (as a cancer) to the SGK, the SGK will assess this report in its own health institution, and decide that your cancer's work force affects you in 60 percent.
However, if you have to complete the 10-year security period to connect your month, you will be able to connect the month.
So as soon as we can say this, it's not wise to apply the health system of the SKK, without seeing the decision of "no disrespect."
But if any security guards who do not work in any way are able to remove all conditions, the SGK may require the identification and connection of the status of honor and the monthly.
If this situation is empty and the other conditions are gone, it might be useful for him to start a little early in the month.
Will the Day of Judgment be a thing of the past?
I'm a bond-kur security officer.
I'm putting everything in order.
But they said, "You can't be ashamed of your duty."
What should I do?
- I'm a valuable student.
Whoever told you was right.
You don't write what other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, it's necessary to pay your press duty 4/b.
But I can give you a special tip.
I'll advise you to pay your debts to banks or similar organizations to do the same.
As soon as the month is fixed, you will receive so many months and you will pay in advance your debt.
It will be easy for you to be held accountable for what you have done.
What is the balance of wealth related to?
I worked on both the SSK and the Link-Kur and the Employment.
Where's the moon gonna connect me when I'm right?
- The most valuable reading, the link, the SSK, and the membership, is that you are the most respected month of your life, the last of which is the security condition. So if you are the last of the SSK, you will leave your job and you will get a month from the SSK by registering other conditions.
SGK-like hospital reports
How's the rich thing done?
Which hospitals can I get a health report?
- It's enough for you to contact social security administrations or social security centres that you're involved in for health care reports.
The SGK will love you for health insurance and research hospitals, university hospitals (except private university and temporary hospitals), and Turkish Armed Forces.
However, as long as these hospitals are not available in the year you are trained, they can also be treated with love for the very grateful patients of the Ministry of Health.
Isn't it possible to love a private hospital?
- There's only possible conditions.
In the former edition, only with the registration of state hospitals, the love of sleep and life-threatening patients who are able to build up their sleep, and the new management that will enter into operation on 01.09.2013 will now agree with the SGK, and the treatment that will treat them in my care and the identification of another life-threatening patient will also be considered appropriate for the special patient who is at risk of death and the health reports that you have received from here will be received.
What are the conditions called for in love?
The security provided by the SEVK requirement is sufficient for the 1800-day premium for the construction of the state of dignity associated with the act of love.
He's going to pay the hospital fees for the property assignment by the SGK.
Besides, it won't take ten years of security.
In the case of a bond of wealth, if a person has the potential to maintain his or her financial situation, the period of 10 years of insurance between insurance conditions is linked to the monthly according to a health-care report only in 1800 days.
That's why, when someone first comes to the hospital, it's probably because I can't afford to be blind.
Nargile Operation
Nargile started to experiment for the pianos that started to fit the caps.
The last week's tests had to stop the sale of a lot of businesses.
In Zabul, he began to edit surgery with a telephony that went on to the coffee shops in stanbul.
The sale of narcissitis was stopped by non-smokers with operations performed in the nargic region.
Almost all the money will be paid to those who continue to sell it to their customers when they're affected by all the nargi.
If the sale continues, it will be closed.
REGULAR PIONEERS
The TAPDK (TapdK) was published in February last year on the “Required Specifications on the Use of This Sites in the Application of the Autonomous Areas/Agency Document on the Status of Use of the Sites”.
With the speech made, it was recognized for five months that the hats were moved from schools to schools at least 200 feet [200 m].
We're also saying he's drunk in hidden areas.
On the first day of the operation, the word began from Bešiktash.
Al Faker, the most popular Nargile in Istanbul, was also forced to stop selling the business of Mis Nargile Cafe in Bebek, the most popular Nargile in the Middle East.
Penalties start at 23 degrees.
In the meantime, 23 thousand TLs will be punished in order to continue to be sold by non-smokers.
Three times you're going to be punished.
It is estimated that there are now about five workers in Istanbul who have a kangaroos.
Warning about too many flags to keep
TAPDK, a 27-year-old TAPDK, managed to bring the nurses into the process of getting their kidney fluids ‘response’. According to the published language, health warnings were transmitted in the form of nargic fluids or in the form of conical form.
Warnings are used to start from the mouth section of the bottle.
Blue, red, black and black can be used to print health warnings.
There's a lot of warnings in the coffee shop right now.
Critical notification to families from security
The Security Authority warns families about the activities of the "white camp", "high camp" that are organised by outsiders.
A new plan was put in place between the teams of the TMKP-C, MLKP, TKP, TKIP, and some legal structures.
In order to collect terrorist attacks, he warned the families that the "white camp" had been organized under the name of "high camp" and that children would not be sent to these camps.
The terrorist police, who found out that 41 camps were planned in different years, wanted to send their children to these camps by meeting with families.
He refused to send 350 families to the camp.
In particular, the terrorist police, such as DHKP-C, MLKP and TKIP, have warned against the activities that young people are expected to win by using the legal extensions of terrorist attacks, such as DHKP-C, MLKP and TKIP.
The 350 families who took note of the police's warnings refused to send their children to camp.
After the police warnings, 41 camp 14 were scheduled to be set up.
The terrorist attacks were carried out by 20 camps against my participation.
The security forces indicated that two camps continued, and five camps were planned to be repaired in the future.
Security General has also sent a letter of notice to the teams on these camps throughout the years.
Young People Ask...
The 20 camps where the terrorist attacks were carried out were held in Izmir, Kokaeli, Balikasir, Chanakal, Niğde, Eskishehir, Bursa, Bartın, Artvin, Mersin and Hatay, Ordu, Samsun, Trabzon, Bartın, Izmir, Bolu and Adana camps.
According to security reports, these camps are mostly attended by young people who have won the university.
Unlawful farmers win the race for young people with propaganda that they are doing in the camps.
In these camps, education for young people who are newly engaged is also increasing their commitment to education for young people.
In these camps, under the picture of the camp camp, education is given in matters such as "how the violence of the actions can be turned into violence."
Half an hour later, it's the message that's coming out.
Dennis Komsa found his owner in New Jersey, U.S.A., who was sent to Atlantic Ocean 50 years ago by a child named Dennis Komsa.
Cam bottle came out of a house next to Sandy Kerrga's house last year in the U.S.A.
"Please answer the following questions, and send them to the address below.
This is a scientific research carried out by Dennis Komsa (12)".
In writing, the person who finds the bottle wants to tell you where, when, and how to find it.
He's also taking the money in his pocket to pay for a gift of cash and mail.
The August 16, 1963, issue of Awake!, had been published in New Jersey, some 35 miles [35 km] away, and it was given to the owner in the past.
Komsa, 12-year-old in 1963, said, about half a century later, that she was surprised to see the bottle she had thrown into the ocean, and she said, "I've put some of them in the water, thinking they're gonna find it, but I've never imagined that the bottle would come back to me."
Loves sound frequencies
He told me what Turkey's first sound mechanics could do with South Pamir's sound frequencies, and I was surprised.
Sound technologies or sound engineering are about to come up with music-related sound systems for everyone's mind.
And did you know that with sound technologies, terrorism can be stopped, the instant noise frequency can be subjected to endless killings, the love of the person you want, the acceptance of a secret, or the acceptance of the world's rhythm?
After completing the Department of Inquiry at the University ofbilities, he graduated from the SAE College in England and trained sound technologies at Middlesex University.
The Institute for Communication Technology in Galatasaray also develops sound technology in the ITMs and provides training in music technology, sound technology, performance technologies, electronic music and recording technologies.
Terrorism subliminal message
"What sound technology exactly?" the first question is.
"A technology that can be used in many parts of the world.
Our brains took everything with electricity.
The sound frequency is a kind of electricity, it's energy.
Using this energy, you can change people's behavior, you can make them move with the command you want."
One of the most important subtle features of sound technology is the subliminal message.
The message contained in the music or song is located in a frequency other than that of a person's origin, which is not identified by the above note, but goes to the bottom floor.
For example, when a terrorist attack was taken, Pamir told the region that he could have a music broadcast.
If a message such as "Do not perform this attack" has been changed to the published song frequency, it will be optionally recognized by the terrorist.
He doesn't understand what he's hearing, but he's got a lower voice, and there's a voice in it that says "don't do."
Even if they see it as a message from God.
But in the world and in Turkey, we're sure that these messages are used without public security.
It's a subliminal message prepared by a conference student at Istanbul Technik University to understand the subject.
"I listened to the students during the conference.
I put in the music an audio frequency called 'Su'.
At the end of my interview, I asked them not to bother the students.
They said they were all very upset in a strange way." She says this experience.
There are those who use the subliminal message, according to Pamir, "some of our country's radio channels have been detected, but the details are not yet known.
In Germany, there is a channel called "Kara sound Radiosu", a frequency for radical Muslims.
It publishes messages that are excessively violent, religious, military, and drug trafficking.
German police and Turkish police know this, but they don't happen because they're changing frequency."
Also, in the music world, such dangerous messages have been used.
Especially in the song of some heavy metal groups...
According to these notions, there was no terrorist in the planes entering the waves, and they were carried out with subliminal commands called the sub-commands of the wounded direct pilots.
Desktop
Sound technologies can also be used in criminal cases.
This knowledge is especially used in U.S. banks.
For example, when the police were on the phone with the police driver, they could identify the room where the sound person on the phone was in the bank, who was in the room.
A sound is different from the sound of a metal, a roof, a plastic, a wall, or any other material.
It is also possible to detect the size of the room, according to the style of the sound, even identifying the shape of the room and how many holes it has.
In effect, the voice of the criminal can be identified by what kind of objects he has, what size he is in a room, and how large he is in a room.
There's also a computer program used to do this that Pamir even made drawings of an opera building from Tataristan, and I thought, "If it's located in 175 Hopperllor's buildings, the perfect sound level can be achieved.
It's not a bad technology, it's worth $4-5 thousand."
The sound frequencies are also used in migraine and decoration.
Pamir's got a lot of work to do on this.
For example, in a restaurant where people go to work, where they're going, where they're going, where they're going, where they don't go outside the table.
Only those on the table can hear what they're talking about.
There's nothing else on the table that's going on two steps ahead.
And the general system of these kinds is: "If you want to destroy a sound, you're going to mix it with another sound in the same frequency of your molecular structure, and you're going to turn it into a tape that destroys the existing sound energy.
No one's ever been able to fly without this system.
Because the sound of the plane engines is so high that they won't be controlled.
These voices will attack one another on the plane and destroy themselves.
Even if your windows are open with this system, you can create a far-fetched environment in your house."
Was the pyramids made with sound?
There are other interesting things that Pamir, one of Turkey's first voices, did.
For example, he arranged for an open air drive in the city of Avyak that could not hear music from outside.
He can't get out of the line, compared to another sound frequency, and he's lost.
If you want, even in a room, a certain line can be made without a voice.
He brought the sports halls and the sports and concerts to a famous school.
It's double-use.
Because when you play basketball, you need to be on the side, but you don't have to be on the side of the concerts.
And in the open-kwave concerts, there are sound technologies that can only provide a quality of sound that music can hear.
"We often use frequencies to destroy the voices that are heard in a loud voice and to improve the quality of the person's voice, making music more pure.
MTV is very advanced in this.
Openkwava sets up concerts and feels like a studio record in the sound field."
That's how Tubika tried.
With the frequency of sound, two aluminiums separate the liver from each other.
There were some scientists who claimed that the pyramids of Egypt were made with sound.
They thought the rocks might be removed by sound and put in place.
I'm asking, "Is it not comforting to be used for bad purposes?"
"I was very afraid when I read the works of the University of York from the Internet, or that others would read.
Because what is written can lead to bad consequences even if people with good intentions do not believe in it without the lab's speeds."
"Employed with the Arabic language"
Süden Pamir, who says that the noise will affect the way we are, explains why: "For all the sounds that you hear are being turned into brains.
The rest of mankind only hear the sound of consensuality, but the other voices, in fact, lead to depression.
The brain needs to be emptied, so it's good to walk out on the ground, walk through nature.
I think there's a need to make arrangements to learn how to talk in school.
So the student only concentrates on the voice of the teacher and can lead to longer concentration."
Pamir, who says that his prayers are likely to be effective if he reads from Arabic, notes that he has a very rich frequency, and notes that when his words come back, the voices will be arranged in a way that will leave a very real impact.
"But I need to read your prayers aloud, and I'll smoke cigarettes when I read the live picture."
Frequent love chart
The question is, "Is it possible to love a person with the frequency of sound?"
Don't love what Pamir gave you, and it's a frequent date to move the feelings of a more honest person, and it's like, "You have to find the frequency of the pressure you're using when you're talking about.
You can use a higher frequency of this frequency to interact with it.
Let's think that the person for example is 300 times the frequency of the press.
And when you're with him, you want to play a music that will arouse his feelings.
If you're going to play the 300-frequency music, you're going to be able to get the power of those who have to print the only ones you have to print on, and you're going to have to do it twice, that person's ability to influence.
Maybe that's the way to show love to the person who's in front of you."
Pamir, who said that there are special sound systems to communicate with politicians in the world so that they can communicate more effectively, can feel a very strong and creative presence when the sound of the press is presented in advance.
"It's about to be made by Michael on Thursday afternoon in Japan, what is it like for you?" Pamir said, "There will be a voice near the human voice because the most powerful voice of man is near its own voice.
For example, what an excellent tool he has been created by the human soul."
'He'll raise gold prices'
Canada Jennings Capital Inc.'s Chief Gold Analyst, Dan Hrushewsky, pointed out that the government's efforts to reduce the value of money companies would also raise gold prices from the current level, saying, "The Lord will continue to be a safe design tool."
In the first half of the last week's most successful global demand year, Hrushewsky, China and India, who have a high level of value for the AA bidder, said, "The gold demand from China is rising in relation to India, and Chinese investors play a major role in this."
Remember that India is the largest gold buyer in the future, Hrushewsky said, "I believe that the government's involvement in the management of gold is no longer so bad.
People will find a way out of this context."
Hrushewsky, in his advice to investors, through long-term investments, will continue to serve the role of a safe design tool.
Many U.S. governments forget the high levels of debt from the 'discipline' failure.
The governments are trying to reduce their debt by reducing the value of money companies.
That's why gold prices are going to rise from their current levels."
"It's a long-term improvement in the ability to reduce the risks of gold and silver."
The World Golden Council's Investment Council is the General Manager of Marcus Grubb, which is simply a physical presence in the more complex and popular financial markets, which are more expensive and reliable, "If you are going to lose gold in a long way, you will be better able to reduce the risks of the underlying characteristics and risks.
The gold ports of small quantities, showing that the profit has grown, have generally proved to be much more stable and better able to cope with the uncertainty."
Grubb, who pointed out that the demand for gold was rising in the last 10 years, "The gold represents less than 1 percent of the world's wealth.
This means that paying money for growth in gold is still very important.
In the course of the past year, more than 78 percent of gold and strong copper entry into the tank is an indication of the protection of the investor's interest in the underlying."
"India must increase national gold stocks to support economic growth."
The world's largest gold market in India and China also contributed to the demand for gold prices, which encouraged the demand for gold, gold, and sugar in the second quarter of the year, and also to the increase in the demand for sugar in Asia.
Grubb, in his speech period, recalled that 54 percent of China's demand for bribes has increased 51 percent in India.
Grubb, who wanted to sell those who had taken gold from a low price and had a higher trend, said, "China would have been silent in the second half of Mucevher's demand.
After the gold prices fell in an unexpected manner, Nissanda grew up in demand and quickly broke down the trunks."
In India, Grubb pointed out that with the government's gold deposits, India's Bank has taken a lot of steps to support the downturn and reduce the flow of debt, "It's as difficult as it is to apply the restrictive applications at the level of gold, and that's why we can ask for enough channels.
The World's Golden Council believes that India's policies should be seen as a strategic investment.
In addition, long-term policy objectives should increase national gold stocks in order to support economic growth in order to support long-term policy objectives."
Global Subroutines
According to the World High Council last week's report, in the second quarter of this year, the global demand for gold was 856,3 tons, global gold reserves and 508 tons.
In the second quarter of the year, while seeking an important increase in the country's demand for asylum, the demand for asylum rose by 54 percent in China, 51 percent in India, 38 percent in Turkey and 33 percent in the Middle East.
In my speech period, the demand for consumer demand in China continued to grow, and the demand for gold increased by 87 per cent over the same year, with the expectation that the prices would increase in the future period, and 276 tons in the year's total.
In India, however, despite the increase in the government's prices for the first gold supply in the first quarter of the year, the demand for tobacco increased by 71 percent to 310 tonnes over the previous year.
A beautiful Karadenian film: Children of Tepenin
Doctor Trabzon...
And the players are some of the most beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, funny people of the Christmas village where the film is taken...
Savda Serbia
There's only 400 thousand TL bottles in the film, lots of birthdays and coffee.
The film "Tepenin's Children 1980", which was featured with love and love, was designed to "each of us want to follow the story of a true Karadenus."
The achievements of Akchaabat's film "Tepen's Children 1980" which was held on the Crossroads of the Accobat, and all of the amateur players, were the reason for the fun scenes of the film itself.
The Forum was concerned about the impressions of the gas pressure in the AVM cinematographic Films.
They signed a great night with a group of people living in a very large cave, with the Horonians and the Karadens.
President Muhammad Balta of Trabzon Beledi, President of the Republic of Ghana, Dr. Orhan Fevzi Gümrükükükökök, Il Emniyat Director Ertan Yavash, Il Kultur and Tourism Director, Akchabat Kukamakam Abdul Rauf Olusoy, Akchabat Beliad was included in the context of the numerous calls by the sponsors of the sponsors, national and local companies.
In the film that Dr. Ismet Erayun wrote, the presidents of the Hautgu Little's exhibition director Samet Karahasanoğlu, Ayše Oztuk, Koral Koch, Salahattin Cakrır, Free Saral, Adam Erayun and Vahide Erayden participates.
In 1980, the Tepenin Children, who were vaccinated with 61 copies, were used for the first time in Turkey to better understand the Karadeniz virus.
We're a star on the roof!
Samet Karahanoğlu is 18 years old.
You're looking at the best game name from Samt, who lives in Trabzon.
Amateur theatre history player, comedian and drama are successful.
Samet Karahanoğlu, who deserves the prizes to the end, has taken over the "will be one of the players of the future."
Between comedy and drama!
In Trabzon's Bibliography Valley, a film about events that occurred in a period near the 12th of May 1980:
"The main character of the film is the father of young Hikmet in Germany.
He continued to write to Kashnu school and was able to complete one of Hikmet's greatest ways of caring for the sheep during the months of his studies and be a doctor.
It's not a lot of things to read and work.
And it's hard work when you add love to Züleyha's richest family.
This love that has been hidden for years is a strong barrier to Hüleyha's father, who has decided to tell Züleyha his friends and his friends.
There are other plans for the daughter of Sabri Aga.
And what they did on the other side of the river together was one of the greatest obstacles to the Tepe, and it was a war against the villages.
Short-term meters from the movie...
Dr. Ismet, director of the Galda film, made the following statements about Tepenin's Children in 1980:
"When this film started, our goal was to make a short film.
But the sights of the first hits were so big in social media that we started to feel excited to draw a long meter and pull it off.
When we went to the division firm in Istanbul, they said, "Do we have a good game?"
And I said, "We don't have the courage, but there's 86 other Karadensian games you can't find anywhere."
A lot of bad bottles were used in movies and shows, and Karadenis was mistakenly identified.
You'll watch 86 original Karadens people in the movie.
I tried to get a film from one of your Karadens.
I wish others had taken it before me, but we'd have watched an incredible comedy movie.
If it wasn't for your charity, I wouldn't have taken this movie.
The first time we wrote the Turkish film, we wrote it under Turkish.
This will be the first one.
We've done this so you can understand your Karaden wine better.
We also wrote down the English speaking courses in the film and translated them into Karadeniz.
When we turned the camera into this movie, the player came out.
We're our first film of the Tepen's Children.
My mistakes, my ex-girlfriends."
Don't miss this hot movie that brought a new light to your cartoons!
Watch your perfume when you choose!
Your personal appearance is superior to your appearance; even if you are walking with a perfume bottle in your hands, be careful.
The perfume you've used may be due to the diseases you've used.
We talked to Dr. Funda Ataman about Civatte Poikiloder, who was more frequent in women and who was the source of various cosmetics.
Dr. Ataman, who wanted to see the depth of coloration seen in the inside and in the sky regions of the Civatte Poikiloderum, said: ‘Inspired by lightning, it emerges as part of the sun’s rays.
The brown red is seen in the shape of the leaves.
It is He Who has made the sun a lamp, and the moon a light, and the stars are a guide to it.
Pulse is one of the options for laser treatment and sun protection.
Another is the use of the creams that contain retinoic acid.
These creams should be used for a long time.
It's not the warmth, the concentration, the appearance of a side effect or an allergic during my use.
In this case, treatment should be continued on a regular basis.
In order to be a family, the parents of Civatte Poikiloder should be informed about early life care and treatment."
He's got a big drop in his cigarette smoke.
In Turkey, the number of cigarettes consumed in the first six months of this year, according to the same trend over the past year, rose by about 10 percent to 41 billion 779 million.
In Turkey, the number of cigarettes consumed in the first six months of this year, according to the same trend over the past year, rose by 10 percent to 41,779 million,190,000,560.
In view of the information provided by the TAPDK, the Global Research for Adults in Turkey has been completed with a view to providing information on the full use of adults and creating a data source for decision makers and researchers in this regard by the Statistical Framework for Turkey.
As a result of the survey, in January 2008, there were 31.2 (16 million people) using all the products in and around Turkey in 15 years and above, with 27.1 per cent (14.8 million people) in 2012 and 13.4 per cent of the total volume of use was reduced.
He uses 41,5 percent of the men, 13.1 percent of the women.
And those who used the whole range also fell from 47,9 percent to 41,5 percent in men, and in women it fell to 13.1 percent in 15.2 percent.
According to the study, he thinks he's going to give up 6 out of 10 people who use all kinds of drugs.
The percentage of those who planned to leave the whole product in one month was estimated to be 35.4 per cent of those who planned to leave it within 12.9 and 12 months.
The evaluation section of the study was set out at the following meetings:
"The net result from the disclosure of all products is that Turkey has implemented all control laws and the Universal Control Programme and the Action Plan.
As a result, the number of students from all over the world has increased from 2 million to 200 thousand in 2012 to 4.1 per cent, with the most specific drop in the use of cigarettes and the lowest educational population in proportion to the increase in prices.
According to the 2013 World Health Report, Turkey has become the first and only country to meet all the criteria, making it the top level of control.
In the report, the other countries wanted to follow Turkey and take the example."
In closed areas, smoking continues to show its effect.
In the first six months of this year, the amount of cigarettes consumed was estimated to be about 10 percent by 41,779 million by 190,000,560.
This number was at 46 billion 325 million at the same time in 2012.
The walls will no longer touch the screen!
Ubi Interactive produced a very interesting product using Microsoft's 'Kinect' technology.
Microsoft included 11 new kinect Accelerator programs last year on support for projects to use Kinect in Windows.
The software department was supporting these companies with money, space, and hardware.
One of the most interesting software demos that emerge from Kinect Accelerator was shown by Ubi Interactive.
A dynamic projector that comes in between Kinect for Windows and transforms the wall into a touchscreen.
According to a new post from Kinect for the Windows web site, there are several companies that test this technology.
The software that tested the collection on 50 in the private beta period is now sealed by Ubi.
It's possible to access files from Ubi's website.
You have to pay 149 for a touch screen for 45 inches.
A 100-inch touch screen capable of touching from 20 points will be $1,499 for you.
Ubi's software and Kinect for Windows are only required to buy the project separately.
Another news to Android!
Google will make it easier to 'take-to-do' with this patent.
Google, the first open-ended interface between mobile operating systems with Android, has received the patent of a new interface technology that will develop for those who regularly share files with friends.
The function of sharing the content over wireless technologies such as NFS and Bluetooth is not, in fact, very different from the Android Beam and Apple Airdrop examples.
The last update to Google's signature is that this task is being distributed to groups around the world instead of single-time partitions and that it is being sent to users by the user.
It's like he's taking a place in the future Android versions of the new feature...
This is Turkey's first local smart phone.
Turkcell's on the smart phone, too.
There's a smart phone factory in Turkey that's going to be co-produced with China.
Name T40
Turkcell identified Turkey's first local smart phone.
The TCELL design in Turkey and with China will send T40 to the market at the end of Monday.
The Turkcell General Director, Sireya Ciliv, said they planned to sell a smart phone T40, which was developed by Qualcomm, the U.S. co-founder and identified as the Gobze project on Saturday, in nine countries where Turkcell was active.
Ciliv, who made a presentation at T40's launch, also said, when he talked to Turkish producers, he said, "A part of T40 will begin to be created in China; in 2013 it will be held in Turkey no more than a year before the end of the year."
PORTRAITS FROM THE PAST
Ciliv, who tells them they're going to sell the phone with an appropriate price, explained that they're going to hear the price soon.
Ciliv said he wanted to increase the use of mobile phones with a more affordable price than selling equipment with T40.
Ciliv, who said that Turkey's T series since 2010 has sold 1 million stamps on mobile phones, indicated that these sales opened up 500 million lira.
THE FINANCIAL WISDOM FOR THE WILD BELIEF
The Turkcell General General said there will be features such as a T40 stop-up, high resolution voice, stronound sound and adjustable user interface.
Ciliv said T40's sale would be explained before the phone came to the market, and the phone's going to fit.
Each year, 5 billion dollars are spent in the field.
When he said that he also supported local production by the Information Technology and Communication System (BTK) President Tayfun Acarer, who was speaking at the meeting, he said, "The phone is 57 per cent of Turkey's calls.
That's why the increase in the number of telephones sold came at $300.
We're surprised every year by 15 million calls, and I'm worried it's going to be going."
The Android operating system will have a T40, Qualcomm paired processor and 1 GB RAM feature.
It's all my boss's got it!
The records of students reading in the normal environment have been updated as a learning environment teacher
The MEB has become the primary, secondary and educational center of all the primary schools in Turkey that we have attended following the 4+4+4 reform of my education.
After a 1-year course of education, the fact that the re-examination of a number of schools has become a reality led to a new scandal during the conversion process.
In Turkey this year, the "reveal" scandal that could affect students of all schools moving to the environment came to light during the conversion and registration process during the Shaker Ortaokul, in the spring of June of Konya.
1 year normal average
In the beginning of the last year, after the 4+4+4 reform, the chess school was turned into a middle school.
In school, students at the first three and four classes to be transferred to another school were studying with students of the 6.7 and 8.
For a period of 1 year, the school served as a normal secondary school, with the end of the 2012-2013 school year, was converted into a school and became a secondary school.
My degree school, for the first time this year, has adopted students in grade 5 as a "study teacher".
But last year, the records of students who read grade 5 in the normal environment, and this year's 6th grade, have been automatically updated as teachers of education and education.
'Other school'
The parents who learned about my condition became complainers when they went to school.
However, the school administration, in support of the instruction received from the Millennium Education Manager, said to the parents, "The parents who don't want their children to continue their studies can take their records with another middle class."
The statement made by Konya Il-Million of Education Managers took place with interesting comments.
He explained, "In view of the number of students and students, taking into account their preferences, we have reclassified some schools with Konya Valiggio, and 15-20 schools have also been converted into schools in Conya.
Schools are entering the e-school system of slavery with school codes.
But the code of the old school is removed from the system by my school teacher.
A new school code has to be set up by students in the system.
They also transferred the students to the community using their new code of education to ensure that students and teachers of different types of school are free of charge.
Parents who want to take their children's shelter from these schools can take them to other schools."
The high bed operation in Istanbul!
160 million liters were talking at 8 o'clock.
In Istanbul, during the operation of the gold team, eight o'clock was said to have been sold to a foreign country and not to enter the gold sector in Turkey.
According to an explanation made by the Bank of Gold and Ticaret, in an operation carried out by the Government of Istanbul and Ticaret Region and the Government of the Sea of Blues and the Government of Istanbul, the 8th floor sold by the Turkish Republic of Turkey by E.A., which was purchased by the Government of the Republic of France, was identified as the company in the name of the money from the Bank.
It was understood that following an investigation by the gold library, U.E.A. brought beds to Turkey to sell them.
A service bag, radar system, like a generator, which was sold to another country and which was not to be admitted to Turkey for 8 seconds.
It was estimated that the total value of all the motor beds mentioned was 160 million litres.
The Metrobus is alive!
As we cross the road in the circus...
The subway that moved to the Avzilars from the concentration camp attacked Yavuzcan Dulgun, who wanted to cross the road right away at 8:30 p.m.
He was hit by the impact of the strike.
Yavuzcan Dulgun was transferred to the University of Bezmialm University of Applied Sciences.
It was found that Dulgun's life was not at risk.
Eight times, your relatives said they're late for the accident.
The police started a case investigation.
