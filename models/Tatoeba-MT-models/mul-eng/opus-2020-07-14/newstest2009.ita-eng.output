Prague's Borsa at the end of the market had a negative turn.
After the storm of the morning, the Borsa of Prague restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares reached almost half the current daily trade.
By the beginning of Tuesday, Prague's Borsa recovered from the roof of the day before it was almost 6%.
Back to this rebellion, there's the crowd of actions at Wall Street.
So, too, we have seen a market reaction as a result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the local financial sector's stabilization plan.
Scroll of actions in Asia
On Tuesday, Asian Bors' actions have lived a dramatic cycle, although the indicators, however, have subsequently cancelled a portion of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Forest during the day ended almost 4%, but then also a part of the losses stabilized by 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong Forest, has decreased by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets have been closed.
The actions at Sydney's Bossa lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses were increased to 4.3%.
Thay-Wan's Borsa, according to the local index, is below 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets worldwide," observed the head of the Hong Kong Currency Office Joseph Jam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages only financial policy, so without relying on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has rates of interest at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return to the dialogue quickly and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is the risk that other countries also have consequences.
Assets of American actions
The US Parliament rejected the support plan for the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars (about twelve billion black crowns) had to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions on Monday lived a strike and the main indicators of the actions recorded the largest circle since more than a century ago.
The Dow Jones index has been reduced by almost 7% and a similar circle has been observed for the last time in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went free.
Congress has passed: the US government can expand $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the US Congress and President George W. Bush's government have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the US financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of the next week.
The US legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic assistance for the US financial system for a total of $700 million (about twelve billion of crowns).
But it's not yet finished.
The representatives of the Congress must, therefore, define some details of the content before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The support plan for the financial system will discuss Monday on the territory of the Chamber of Representatives.
So said Dominica to Reuters, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Finance Services of the Barney Frank Room.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and most fundamental psychological factor to be able to re-establish the financial markets.
However, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, the aid of the markets will be achieved.
Paulson: the Piano must be effective
"We have taken a great step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the way in which the package is presented for market stabilization," said democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place Sunday.
Members of the legislators met on the evening between Saturday and Sunday with the Minister of American Finance Henry Paulson to finalize the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to obtain non-cash mortgages from financial companies, which bring financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are committed to the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to bring forward the recovery plan, but I think we are." said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is very strong on the markets of the actions that are fraught with it.
According to Nevada Harry Reid's democratic senator, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement with Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm the investors before trade on Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the market in Monday following the Congress decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be held at the last moment on some problems.
The legislators hope to be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still make a lot of changes.
The total amount provided for in support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the balance of the sum in case it has the impression that the programme does not carry out its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the end of 350.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations.
Although the President may vote on this decision, Congress may lose its right to vote.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program remained, i.e. to obtain funding to buy passive mortgages, whose price is broken by hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and on the Monday," said the Republican Senator.
The progress in negotiations is also met by American President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush is satisfied with the positive rise of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit such parachutes of gold to the managers of companies participating in the programme and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and have taken a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan relates to the aid to owners of houses that have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates with the aim of reducing monthly interest rates for debtors and allowing them to have their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why we don't know how and why the price will be bought the problem-related assets
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses between them," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of the next week it is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, this week the representatives of the Congress have reached an agreement on the support of this plan and are baptized as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important," Marek stressed.
End blood dues: MP3 readers against cell phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for seeking an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you will find it difficult to buy a high-quality bicycles to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not know how LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is no objective reason.
If, however, on your shoes you will be covered with hard-rock wines, jazz or blues probably, a kind of giraffe like the least you dream about.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader of 8 thousand crowns, as well as a fan of the Pink Floyd may find it difficult to dilute the cubes from twenty crowns in the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The decision is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality musical readers are able to do much more than simply read music, but they don't even make mobiles for mistakes.
There is no other current device as universal as your cell phone.
Depending on primary functions, telephone and texting, you can read music and videos, record both and have a photo machine, sometimes better and perhaps you can also navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and palmaris, you will also have a computer in charge.
It's a little miracle yet no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of cell phones also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your cell phone and first the screen indicator will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobiles are able to read the music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, musical readers (especially the simplest) are much more effective.
As far as economic cells are concerned, they may last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from when, some call, you're looking for work to secure another battery, that's also true for the most expensive devices.
But you will not have this problem with a MP3 reader, even the worst will last for at least 9 hours with continuous load.
Another problem arises when the music is downloaded in the cell.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices have a universal USB port and not all can connect to your computer without a special software.
Of course the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to make it without suitable for minicards that are not used in the cells.
Readers, despite some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill in the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most of the readers and readers only create a multimedia library ordered by the names of the interpreters, the name of the album, type or by the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, like the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manage, mobiles can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are especially interested in the resistance of battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly the ease of use.
If the music serves you mainly from the background and if you listen to it all the days just briefly on the tram you have enough cell phone to read MP3.
This can now, clearly, be any cell phone.
You don't have to care much more about how the cell phone or reader recognises you.
The MP3 readers all support them, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be exactly in this format.
In addition to this format, which belongs to the most common ones, the majority of the devices support music in the WMA format.
There is less AAC (a format used by Apple and its Ipods).
The best mobiles also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit, via the mobile internet, the operator's matching pages (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument to buy a reader cell.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is a mystery and it is usually limited only to a hit at the time of the radio.
Prices aren't very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will in the future dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry the cell phone behind.
Anyone wants to listen to any cheese in the bag while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
It depends on this, however, if you always carry the suitcases or at least the auricola without a wire.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers, has.
Maybe the biggest advantage of readers will be, for many, the price.
Those most economics usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of income for the common tariffs.
The best cells and from the most equipped technical point of view, and also with the 3.5 mm grip for common coffees, cost up to 15 milligrams of crown.
Rather, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy to manage.
Those simple ones do not necessarily need more economics (see our choice) that makes it really easy for anyone to manage them.
The minimum function, the similarity of the mangevolence once with the stereo-comune or perhaps the giraffe, is obvious.
There is no danger that it is dangerous to hesitate to launch the mobile Internet network and therefore a giant data transmission ticket.
Which device to use
Even the most economic cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) have a slot for interchangeable memory (by type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with regard to the purchase of that card, it is reflected in the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy a low cost MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding audiences, you will prefer to take specialized mobiles - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and service comfort so they are close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more streets, whose walkman-line cells have the same use scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in maximum line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile telephone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing – a virtual operator that requires traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
Since these operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe, we have written many times on Mobile.cz.
At the end of the accounts it also confirmed ČTÜ, which has noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming tariffs, perhaps there will be a paradox situation - for some mobile operators whose SMSs are less expensive than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition that would really want to start the dispute.
It may sound absurd, since we have three mobile networks and coverage high above 100 %.
Instead, mobile telephone operators like to relax because the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÜ), Pavel Dvorák, who has expressed in the past several times that there is no other operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its network has probably no more options. (The rest may be difficult to find other frequencies now.)
But there is another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators itself has led to a significant reduction in prices, which the traditional operators should then have responded.
At the same time even before the entry of squalls like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices were collected in Britain like us.
However, it has been demonstrated that the place for operators of the species is there and that they may have really been successful.
At the end of the accounts for examples we don't have to go very far.
In February of this year, we have informed you about the arrival of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In the mid-year alone, this operator has been able to conquer more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, Mobilking is the Penta financial group in the Czech Republic belonging to another U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific stock-group.
In order to be able to actually operate it, many less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not go back, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators are usually low-cost, they offer low-cost calls and SMS, which is often in line with the most limited service offer.
So for example Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that costs at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good moss on a small-scale group.
This operator therefore specifically refers to men.
"The real men choose Mobileking Operators whose favorites and whom they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can claim a concept similar to that in Poland.
There is no doubt in the press for Vodafone Miroslav Čepicý: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
More than the point of view of services is relatively satisfactorily."
In Czech Republic no possibility, the mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there's ever been an operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be the Mobilking.
"It is about the expansion of this success project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have a lot of expectations.
Mobilking's arrival will take place in the other countries of our area," said Jana Studničkova, the printer of the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thought.
Instead, they try to do everything because there is no competitive potential.
For a while he does not hide his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Nova group that would want to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in the ability to provide our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecoms.
And it's better first.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the hidden operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to move forward in negotiations with some of them," says the spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl group.
So maybe better times will come.
The non-official information reveals that the first virtual operator must have it at the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-time virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has come up to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršön of the print section of Phone O2.
Other operators are also involved in the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile printer Martina Kemrová adds in a strange agreement with the O2: "We have not yet noted any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult for a virtual operator to appear within the end of the year.
At this point, we must already have a concrete agreement on the table so that it could be considered as a horizontal one."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather than on the achievement of its 3G licence requirements.
Add Miroslav Čepicý : "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, and this is especially in terms of the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the most productive of the customer's view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for quick mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with the complex operators
The attitude of mobile telephone operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, a reduction in prices and a reduction in profit.
Then why facilitate the access of such a competitor?
The walls around the U:fon testify that when the operators have something they can take away from the same part.
Perhaps the great pressure was pushed against ČTÜ in the U:fon creation period towards T-Mobile company.
This is evidence of public access to ČTÚ websites.
But now the U:fon serves as an argument for which the virtual operator does not accept.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The competitive environment of the mobile telephone market has been little more powerful than the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another competitor would affect him and above all his high-priced services."
However, the attitude of mobile telephone operators is quite surprising to the whole interest of the blind regulatory bodies.
It is not just the attitude of the ČTU which is concerned in the Czech Republic - the difference between Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, in the face of all the problems, this has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator on the mobile phone market would be possible after the completion of the contract for selecting the infrastructure required between the mobile operator and the virtual operator has been completed.
No kind of contract has been concluded until now because the offer of potential buyers is probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional operators," Kristián Chalupa said, from the section for external relations UOHS, in response to our questionnaire.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
Instead of the office that must defend the interests of consumers and above all the fact that no one benefits from its position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Where virtual operators work commonly, we can note that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and price reduction do not fall within the interests of UOHS.
Very shocking in the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators as a result of their reactions.
The question about whether it really is only a coincidence is left by itself.
Just as the same price of petrol for all petrol is different from the fruit of coincidence and competition.
"The section did not find signs of anti-competitive behavior on this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he has no greater responsibility for his market behaviour.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing to the telecoms regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contradictions .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÜ, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On a market of the kind, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator, the network operator's agreement is always unnecessary.
And the mobile operator has- at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS it should be a minor warning that three mobile operators are doing so strangely similar.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the said company GTS Novara) show that during negotiations with all operators, there are very similar obstacles.
Downloading ČTÜ responsibility in telecommunications is a fairly common trick with which UOHS is out of all the facts.
We've already dealt with this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTÜ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts were looking forward to improving the situation.
The representatives of UOHS need to know more about this, but perhaps their interests are different.
You can do it when no one's watching
While we do not agree with the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, there are some of them in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that publish their list of mobile telephone services prices but are only partially published.
This is usually the case with companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the persons eligible.
Magic is in the fact that the company faces the operator as a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prevent a similar sale.
"If the cases you have discussed, which we are interested in, could be dealt with in breach of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová answered the question.
But it is unlikely that a kind of activity would not come to the ears of the responsible subjects of mobile telephone operators.
In particular in the case of the 3 companies mentioned above, thousands of customers can be treated.
No operator defends itself at the same time from a kind of attitude.
From the activities of these companies, this is a non-independent profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only one percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered in their name, so they can not fully have it as the usual clients of mobile phone operators "
But this should result in a minimal shock to ČTU.
In addition, another question for UOHS is open.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a kind of attitude, why stop the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has strong rights to mix similar activities and, if he does not want to, should not be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all of this and that their commercial conditions prevent him.
When we're not going to be more expensive
As already mentioned in the text, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile phone market has led to a significant reduction in service prices.
At the same time virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, too satisfactorily, problems with quality services, etc.
However, in the developed countries in these cases, regulatory bodies have intervened, not by mobile telephone operators, but by their clients.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, it was achieved by the creation of the first virtual operator and by others.
Unfortunately, these regulatory bodies are running from one another all the case as a volleyball pattern.
For our experience, we cannot escape the feeling that the lack of clarity of competence in these cases makes him more comfortable.
But we won't win the jump.
If the information of the backstage is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the mobile telephone market will return to motor.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficultly UOHS could remain unable to refuse (discrimination) to other stakeholders.
And we will probably stop calling for higher prices than for the rest of Europe.
The new ink has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Inno.
Sunday's Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech State's recognition day, presented the new registrations of the National Inno's "Kde dodomov myj".
The new registration of the Inno was made by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – assolo with male or female voice, mouse step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Katerírina Knížínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the Inno revisions are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful women.
He already told the radio "Český dihls" that he chose to sing the variants alone, the songs with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care of both the heart and the heart, they have the clear statement, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national wedding will be held next year on the 175th anniversary.
The song "Where my home" was first sung in 1834 on the part of the Stavovskéh festival in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music by Frantisšek Škroupa.
He bought the popularity and people spontaneously made it.
The first stop of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 was then the natural part of the 'national dream'.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the Czech Republic autonomous.
How the "new" sound
Prague MHD Wednesday will accompany you for the first time with an electronic screen
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the subway, tram and bus will take out the first passengers that will have an electronic chair instead of the ticket.
At this moment you can find about a hundred people who own their Opencard box.
Passengers can buy that from 30 and 90 days and annual (which will take place from the first January 2009) and at the same time get their mail loaded in Infopoints and the Transport Company offices and the stop of the Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
Talliandi can already buy online from the Transport Company page www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers benefited from the service before breakfast.
Those who start using the Internet service can completely forget sports in the metro shutters where they have to make long files for card tickets.
The tagging is bought online and on Opencard is purchased on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a personal-format sport that will help customers in the purchase on the Internet and will record the credit they have acquired on their card." said project spokesman Martin Opatrní.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to load the electronic sizes on Opencards in banking and self-services that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these banks?
They are red, dreaming of the ticket obligators and passengers have already noted them at the stops of Roztyly, Budějoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city, but by the end of the year which should be twenty," Opatrní concluded.
The drawing will be controlled rather than from the author of the bankomat.
The banking service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard box and prior payment of the drawing, you will be loaded up.
The electronic tessers will be available from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
This is in the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of central Bohemia take to reach capital.
"In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague there are the multi-letter letter readers with which they verify temporary and zone validity," he explained the mode of control of Filip tickets by the Ropid organization, which sets the time limits for the collective transport of Prague.
Urban buses have the books of integrated cards in the author's house.
It is therefore necessary to show not only the magnetic card to the author during the exit, but especially to support the Opencard at a specific point next to the house.
This is how the author verifys the validity of the loaded cuts.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loads, there is nothing easier to ask the driver for this type of information," Drapal added.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the drawing is reduced, can return to the self-service bankomat, where the tapes are loaded on the card.
This will display information on the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Sumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the U.S. patronage.
With this desire, according to what it is said, some groups of Germans of the South have turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is more than the letter preserved in a private archive and now stored in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Sumava district" – occupied by Hitler under the Monaco agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," wrote in a letter signed with the words "The people who have the destiny of Shumava with all their heart."
Because, they say, the addition to Czechoslovakia – known as the Czech national character – gives the Germans only hope for the brutality, the lack of regard, 'incompetence, oppression and slavery', the authors of the letter ask the American president to take the protection against Shumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the opinion of a quarter of millions of people, you will recognize this territory as a foreign state, who attacks and robs ethnic minorities and has not contributed to anything, even for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign it is the alleged fear of the sales site by the "close press".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Shumava , a referendum would be held in the district on the desire of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the United States' sovereignty.
Although the text of the letter may seem strange to our knowledge of the history of post-war warfare, according to some witnesses, the expectations of the Germans of the Soviet Union are well described.
Even though the Germans had to at least assume that they would have been moved from the Republic, only a few of them accepted the whole possibility of moving from the Republic.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a sort of autonomy for the people of the South.
Others believed that they would simply have remained in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as German of Buddejovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Holštýn , dozens of other German prisoners went to find him so that he could teach him the Czech.
"These thought that once he returned home the Czech would have comforted him," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners seen in Czechoslovakia during the war, according to him, were to be transferred from the Republic on the basis of the decrees of Beneš.
Don't think!
The emotional campaign will attack the authors
The most expensive action in the Czech history, directed to road safety.
It could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to make from Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ales Rébeček expects this to encourage the leaders from a dangerous behaviour to the volunteer.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on volunteers.
The authors should be encouraged by the quick guide and under the influence of alcohol on the fly.
And remind them also to put the belt before starting.
He wants to touch the conscience, especially young drivers, motorcyclists, legs, and not the professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the "sanguous" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think!
The word "do not think" is capital on the tarpaulin.
And in a blood bag there's the word "you're going to be."
This must symbolize that a person can in an attempt to pay a distraction with his own life.
The spots will "spaventer" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where they can generally see images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It is thus promised to reduce the number of incidents and deaths on the dark streets.
The spot was prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Charging and Commanders
"With the carrots, the carrot system works.
The card for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The bacon is the danger of the lung or the accident.
We need to remember the risk to the leaders," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce hospital.
And that's why we want information campaigns in the press and especially negative publicity, he believes in psychology.
According to him, the panels that warn the users of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warned of the danger has been installed, it will probably meet with the environment soon and the leaders will not pay any more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would restore almost all the territories occupied in exchange for peace.
The Israeli provisional government Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the restoration of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to restore almost all areas (occupied), if not all," said Olmert to the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He agreed that the possible restoration would also include East Jerusalem .
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want the Russians or the spies to take the passengers, as happened to one of my best friends, to abandon one part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in the scene at the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"Whoever wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he also stressed.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for the withdrawal of Israel from the heights of Golan, i.e. the condition that it is necessary to conclude this peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort by Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (the Sciati Movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas' terrorism, Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Question after the incident: Are the drivers illegal in the buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the bus that goes far
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padova of the student agency pulman of the company, the question was raised whether the runners and passengers can move on the side of the bus during the course.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the work of the Steward is in conflict with the road traffic law," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident last week with which a 22-year-old hostess lost his life was caused by a truck that cut the road to the lungs.
The girl was sadly seated at the moment when she approached the driver on the less secure spot of the powder, although there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can cause an accident or also freeze during the time of the distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped or less than foot-and-mouthed according to the driving licence.
If not approved, passengers must be seated.
The student agency's buses did not stand, confirmed it on the website Aktualn.cz by the director of this Radim Jančura.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at first did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the course if they have assigned the place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the Stewart.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the Stewart – no law is involved in regulating this role."
No regulation, however, prevents the carrier from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds the spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorní, however, considers that the law is sufficient to address this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has put it in approved feet.
It's all right," he says.
Category the buses in cities where there are parking spaces and the maximum limited speed, interurbans with parking spaces with higher and longer speed without parking spaces with the maximum permitted speed and seat seating equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Horín does not find the problem of the background in the movement of drivers on the side of the bus.
"During a quiet course there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
Not even there is safe when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can break his head."
"If the bus makes a broken brake, obviously, the laws of physics are void.
Just like the urban pulman or the tram.
The carrier must resolve the safety of the Stewarts by means of an internal regulation," he also says and intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport that offers the services of the Stewards..
This doesn't take about two hundred.
The Director even after the incident considers their dangerous mission.
"I will not just have the sense of having to consider the profession of the Stewart as dangerous work, I will cancel it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
It would also reduce the costs," he says.
Asiana's director Alexej Litvin, who manages a group of lines compared to the Student Agency, has caused the absence of the Stewarts on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have any enemies, we've been fighting since the beginning.
Before or after it will end with a fatal incident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has taken place.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years, was fired.
A Slovenian truck is probably out of the emergency race without using the frequency and has blocked the road to the lungs.
The pulman's driver tried to avoid him with a rough handle, but he hit him with the front of the right.
Jančura refused to accept the fact that the two places reserved for the rest of the Stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to book these places in long-term powders, they are reliable."
The tooth has the intention of accusing the driver of the truck.
The Agency will not wait for the Court's judgment to pay damage to the girl's family, but it expects a financial compensation from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not in View
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarifying the movement of drivers on the bus.
"They have not achieved any concrete results, however.
They do not consider them as much pulses, if they take more of the rating system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the cell phone during the guide," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of drivers as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes Porter Havelka, who is responsible for the control of bus safety by police and security officers.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Francoforte
The words are not missing in the letter from the Director of WestLB addressed to the staff of the house.
In the letter published Monday that could form "the capital market centre of the financial group's savings accounts" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch "a competent block" with sustainable benefits in such an undertaking.
In addition, all such a union could be a decisive incentive for further links in the banking sector of the Landers.
That is how it is read when a Board of Directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Oversight Service Agency, having taken note of time ago to the regional government of the Northern Rhineland - Westphalia that time limits the search for a future solution.
I have a connection between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Risparmio Cases because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB is probably already talking about it a little bit, even from Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas referred to the act of presenting the bill of the first half of the year that a merger of the house in Magonza with a national bank such as the Helaba or the West LB did not make sense.
However, the Deka Management Board, which is brought by regional banks and savings funds, has delegated to the Management Board to conduct talks with the West LB on common contracts.
It could be market negotiations or some of them.
But the conversations have, as they say in the square, just started.
From the Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of those who are more involved in business in Francoforte, not talking about the first time it comes to strengthening the rescue case sector.
In 2003, for a short period, it seemed that the Deka-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and Helaba.
There's nothing about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Renania-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stockholm.
However, they have often thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end of Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
On the other hand, it seems that you create the cognition, that you need to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Landesbank has been held with the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, it's not all good news.
If pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will lose their hands.
In the South we would now be the young partner, although it has so far exceeded the financial crisis much better than the houses in Monaco and Stockholm.
The Association of Assia-Turingia Saving Cases, which participated in 85 percent of Helaba, placed the chain at the meeting with the WestLB.
Only NordLB would stay
These geo-strategic reasons are just one account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to combat the various business models of individual houses.
In June Merl pointed out that the decision-making question, which business model would ensure the future of the regional banks, would not have been answered by the association of the German savings cases.
In the end, the West LB division may also come out, which is of course not desired.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors expresses the desire to appeal in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parties with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time while for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so she says everything is different.
Behind their reach to the 5l bar of the Kaiser brand is a massive barbaric and shows about 200 travelers who are the deep tones that can produce from the gorge.
Elena first give Luca a pack and after a bath.
I came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to bus parking near Porta Nuova station, they arrive at 23.45 four flights to Monaco, the Birra Festival", arriving at 6.30 p.m.
Three courses are reserved mainly for Italians, in another Brazilian alone.
In an corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing with the band in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so funny, says Marco, that it's not for Italians.
Mark who wears a long hat with a fake film feeder and a couple of glasses with large silver bars belong to the buses.
From 5 years to October, this year is 3 tours.
The night shift, from day to day, returns to 22.30.
Nighting would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The 45 Euro cost includes travel, the welcome of the brandy with the Kaiser beer, made according to the values of Bavarian generosity, the disease case and the German leadership – Marco has attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so tonight the buses come back to Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence fell in the bus, the passengers fell asleep.
Better yet, they will still need their forces.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian buses on the A9 highway take a short break before Monaco.
When, as planned, Marco's group arrived at 6.30 in the parking area near Theresienweise, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are grouping together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First: put the yellow hat on.
On the left there is "Oktoberfest" along the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Cononscersigatingo.it".
Second: "When I open the doors of the tower of the beer means running!" says Marco of the first morning.
"Corre!" ran and occupied the post in the back of the tent.
"Don't go ahead, let's block it, and not all the yellow-haired jelly sitting on the same pants, split up in the right space!"
The bottle costs 8.25 Euro, Marco's gold.
And don't forget to give up.
"Show us the security service, we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they will come to nothing."
Third: "Today at 22.30 points we meet again here! Understand?"
He's already gone for the party.
On the way, one attack follows the yellow edges of the trees, the street directories and even a public folder of a large Bavarese popular party.
You want to be ready to fight the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "the weekend of the Italians".
There are no accurate data, there are 50 miles, which are born to pass through the Alps and engulf tendons, and it is claimed that 10% of visitors are coming from Italy.
Monaco's police are strengthened with 7 agents from the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the Bavarese Red Cross, which makes statistics on nationality, where Italians first have 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the trend of Hofbräuhaus.
1. Innocent nights for the creditors of the Real Estate Hypo
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed by the Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that politics has used the word "relative" and has also increased, that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis began at the end of the week.
The real estate funder Hippo Real Estate, mentioned in the DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a German banking firm to protect themselves from market turbulence.
One expert on the situation said to Reuters on Monday that support credits would reach EUR 35 billion.
The Real Estate Hypo must only pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from private banks and from the public.
In the background are the losses of the Defa affiliate.
The State funding provider, according to a newspaper article, has been refinanced in the short term – which is no longer possible because of market challenges.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves decreased by 95% over the EUR 2.37 million, even the share of the capital itself fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current incomes and net income from financial transactions have fallen to 0 compared to last year, the benefits from increases both in demand and certain actions as regards the liquidation of credit advances have decreased by more than 70% over the EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher revenues from the reimbursement of sub-compensation costs resulting from both the restructuring of the former Defa group and the reimbursement of interest under the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for corporate consolidations, the negative profit has been sufficiently moderate to about 16%.
The former public financer after being privatised in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were incorporated into the Aareal Bank.
As the income in the classic state funding was too low, the Deffa was committed more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private and state investors (PPP) projects and was internationally differentiated.
The Real Estate Hypo must now kill the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the benefit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007, 2/3 were reduced.
The Real State Hippo after the absorption of the Defa is an important financing officer of the State and of the infrastructure.
It is more dependent on the refinancing of the market between banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer credit deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the grant of loans between banks in most of the world has been excessive, because banks have accumulated liquidity.
The Real Estate mortgage is required annually for a part of the Deffa credit portfolio – about 50 billion – in a short term.
According to Hypo Real State, the group's financial requirement was covered by the credit for a certain period and the company was protected from the influence of international monetary markets for the most non-functional.
In other sources, it is felt that, thanks to the money, the funding is secured by the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the Steering Committee of HRE Georg Funke told the contrary that the HRE Group will not need a short time of monetary markets.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Oversight Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the commerciality of the HRE group is still ensured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and competitiveness of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding will not be fully used.
But even the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank as it was trained to fail, the immediate rescue was not able to calm the souls.
The operating rate is 75% above EUR 3.30.
They're good enough to give you the rides of the mutants.
While the debts of the previous degree are almost irrevocable, they pass the courses of the post-posted credits.
In particular, the mussels of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate have been able to understand the declines with a decline over 2009.
Before the Della HRE currencies seemed to have an alternative investment, now their validity must, after strengthening the banking crisis and the institution itself, which, with the wake of the Deffa crisis, should be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the central banks, governments and less damaged banks are still ready, they can count on the death of the annualities within the term.
On the contrary, what no one is looking forward to – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
However, as regards the information which is incompatible with the partial statistics, the probability is almost certain to become a justifiable hope.
In particular, it will create for long-term investors several nights inconsistencies with the decision to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the report of losses for future payments of the reimbursable rate on surpluses.
Sylvana and the Bento-Box secrets
When Sylviana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should appear at the Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-nel's new exchange log from Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
I'm so excited.
I was just tired of going to school.
I stay at Tokyo's border to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes with the train to get to the Tachibana High School.
The road was to find me alone and luckily I didn't lose.
The beginning of the first lesson time does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Bassa Sassonia.
Schools reached a plan from 8 in the afternoon, until 8.40 a short conversation with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before I started the lesson, I was touched by my presentation.
I'm not the guy who speaks volunteerly in front of people, in front of a class of 40 schools.
Since I had not yet had the school uniform, I was put in an old house of the host mother, along with a truck, blue pants and black shoes.
So I put myself in front of the cathedral, and I tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and party in one week my birthday.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class were dressed, dressed and made sign, and I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lesson of Japanese girls to survive and means "carino, sweet".
Then I run fast to my place.
The girl who approached me was a honor to sit next to an exchange hall.
The rest of the lesson time was continued quietly, but when he sounded the gong, they were absorbed in the true sense of the word.
They all spoke indisorderly, they laughed at me, and they followed me with questions – then it is really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the meantime everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother just made me the pancake for Lunch-- it's different from the new German pancakes.
I had dried up with species, salsicines, cetriole insulation and algae, fruit and a kind of invertebrates with meat and tofu..
In fact, I don't even know what to eat exactly in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the flowers put under the floor, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bento made of herself, prepared artificially, with the hope of making the boy know during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga smoke.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
"Why is Japan really?" my friends asked me when I told them, that I would want to go to Japan for a year at school.
I always said,
"Why is it bothering me?"
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years with fervor.
And to better understand the smoking and culture that they contain, I started learning some Japanese.
I was absolutely convinced that we would come once.
They also highlight tradition, habits and customs.
There's a lot of them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and last trends - on the other hand against: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Even the rats have feelings
A rat or a scarf escapes when they feel the danger.
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: so many animals also have feelings.
4. But how can you verify whether, when they act in our own way, they have our own feelings?
On the Internet "Edge" journals for a few years are published articles of scientific information.
6. Online SPIEGEL in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What does he think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other state of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about the sense or general conscience, we enter an improbable territory, because the reference base does not fight.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that the other animals do. That is to be killed, fled or attacked.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists realize that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe this.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, it is often associated with the lateral cross-border cortex with human consciousness, associated circuits (this for its direct sharing in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
For at least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the cross-border cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus laid on the assumption that man is quite different from the other primates.
Another dramatic feature should be presented in the way of human speech: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said that it is related to conscience.
In this case animals may be excluded.
Although knowledge does not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how conscience can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, by analyzing it through your own experience because of the special hardware, their research will lead to serious problems.
Most of the interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of the consciousness to which science would be more easily accessible.
They could analyze the processes of the conscience of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens in the studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
Therefore, because of this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, he goes first to the neural correlates of consciousness that cause mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the pre-frontal cortex for the implementation of the visualisation.
What, then, is it about feelings?
I urge them that an emotional system like that of fear be activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "dangerous" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) takes up the memory of work.
Such feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular human beings.
With the speaking nature, there are subtle manifestations of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In this respect, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings are more primitive in the regions of the body of the senses of the cortex and the head panel, similar to Jack Pankseep, who is still more concentrated on the paleocephalo.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could definitely be part of the feelings of the species.
At a purely theoretical level, I can't contradict it, but I think it's inexhaustible.
Pankseep leads arguments about the fact that what appears to rats and human beings as fear is likely to happen with both senses in both cases: but how can you verify if rats and human beings try the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A carrot in danger escapes as if he was afraid too?
In my eyes the simple somnolence of behavior can still show no vital symmetry.
And that's what the neural comparison continues to be of help: rats and humans have similar paleonencephals, the scarfs don't even have a brain.
But is the paleoencefalo responsible for feelings?
And even when you can show it for human beings, how would you like to show it on the rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, maybe the insects (who know him), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to show it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human conscience is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of the rats.
In any case, there are progress at the nuclear level, in agreement with the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don't search for language and conscience in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered myope, but I prefer to take steps ahead rather than always fight against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional for this point.
President of the UEFA Platini: return to Poland and Ukraine
The vice-president Ivan Vasjunik said that preparations would soon be put under direct responsibility by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise Europeans with Poland," said Vasjunik
"This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
Both home-based countries are in the March table for the construction or reconstruction of stations, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be allocated to the Europeans will be reduced by eight to six.
"We can't lose any more time.
Now we must work at the maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian Association Grigory Surkis.
"the UEFA will always have eye."
A more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the management of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.

Dennis Quaid was angered.
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he spoke of the private and now has grass with the ex: Hollywood Mig Ryan's star declared his ex Dennis Quaid as an adult.
He's getting angry with the bastard.
The war of Roses was delayed for the former couple of Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two actors of Hollywood now argue with each other about a serious fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed himself on the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been to me long infatuated, and this has been very painful."
The touch of traditions would have come to know it only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "smoothing of the soul" was the work with Ryan's print for his new film "The Women" – tells the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to her being publicly declared an adult husband was clear: it would be "inaudible", he said the fifty-fourth of the "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the first time repeats and rereads the story of our report".
It would also be "deplore" that in Jack, the son sitting together, again "is publicly remembered the pain and subversive, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from the separation, Quaid is newly married and will soon become a father of apples.
And that is why his judges close with the frequency: "My life is going forward in any case.
I think I'm lucky to have a wonderful family where everything goes for the best."
Prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were more economical than last year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be made up to 50% more economical
Holidays and nights in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study by the financial supplier and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, observed a clear decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have been increased for years, overnight nights in many places are already priced.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review around 6.9 in comparison with 2007
From April to June, however, prices had already been below 3,6 % lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak share of the dollar, which would have led to a "flying desire to travel with American tourists"
Also financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would be affected by the price reduction of the hotels in a stronger way from industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3% are expected to be added to the record in Europe.
Even with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still above:
Due to the defeat of the Cherosene, the passengers of the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-term fuel flights would be added to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, prices of the Economic Class air tickets were high by 12.5 % compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in the Business, the price changes were much longer.
In Germany prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose from 11.9 %, and the second quarter dropped from 23.6 %.
As for domestic German flights according to the study, prices have been reduced.
The reason for the collapse of prices would be a partial economic growth, explains the company.
The request in many segments of the air travel market has been rejected.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition through the open-air agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
The critical situation would be the removal of non-recovery contracts at the Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only 24 airlines have been treated in Europe.
The HSV beats the Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and method, Amburg's SV becomes a capitalist.
An 11 working group is still not available in the Borussian Luhukaka.
Kristoffer Klein here is more successful landing for the national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player has first entered the game later and failed with a hit on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, passing it on the labs in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the streets of the arena of Amburg.
There was no big success in the catacombs, the game break was over, and most again sat in its place.
Rieger has been for almost 3 decades HSV physiotherapist, enjoys an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his monitor also found a hearing in the high spheres.
Assistant Allanator Cornelius Jol has announced and has raised the pollice within approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the mayor of Hamburg, Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded the same way: here's the second goal!
The change in position has not been verified.
"Today it wasn't all good to see you," admitted Marcel Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "more relaxed."
For 1 to zero those in Amburg should thank the head beat that went to Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many of Gladbach's weak players could not hurt the weak players in Amburg.
"It was a slender victory," said Martin Jol.
Amber's SV this Monday will be 121 years old.
The viewers have already celebrated the evening afternoon, if so, the sky on the arena and the lighting classification on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"we are able to put everything in place," said Marcel Jansen.
It has the present, that the provisional certificate from table is more indicative of the impresistability of the campaign than of the domination of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals later – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the Petric gatekeeper as well as Jansen supported by the FC Bayern – finds it slowly, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribling," relaunched with force Jol.
After the vote

The sum must be paid, however, not in a fine, but in degrees.
The State had to maintain the share options of the financial companies, which could be withdrawn with an adequate increase in the quotas, in order to reduce the dueness of the State's cases.

The dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon creates perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be the right thing to do.
The Ulysses space probe has flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that quickly freeze on you now the death for freezing.
Among scientists over the years, a mysterious phenomenon creates a pattern – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight of space probes, with which they get additional slant/spin/scillating in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical transmitter as well as Ulysses solar probe.
What the students have been doing for years: the races do not behave as we would expect under the gravity law.
Previously on irregularity at speeds.
The probes become faster or slower.
So far the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year was abolished by Swing-by's anomaly.
Some experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curve of space, might not be correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before Einstein did not fail, and tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by through such dark matter that astronomers have warned in space.
"Responsible to the anomaly may be the dark matter that might also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter the students in the space are known for only about 10 years.
Clearly, it is an attraction force, whose effect on the other heavenly bodies is seen.
Instead of everything invisible, it means that you don't send or reflect any sort of electromagnetic radiation, especially some visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Rape tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their sequencors, the rapist tourists in Egypt would be again free, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese refugees asked for several millions of euros of cash.
In a spare room before release, 6 sequentials were killed.
In the south of Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
The rebates are already under way.
The Germans are always in the shadow of the sequencors.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are certainly free.
This was consistent with Egyptian state television, the Arab issuer Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're examining their health status," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian co-workers would be in good health and safety, he referred to Egyptian state TV.
The 19 components of a shipment in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The remnants of a shooting took place only a little while before the release of the hostages, so the fugitives after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the arrest, before the Sudanese army was killed by a surprise of 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the officer.
It would still be "just trying to get the hostages in hand," when this surprise came at an unexpected time.
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between the Sudan, the city and Egypt had been killed by gun attacks from 6 of the fugitives and captured by 2 of them.
The sequencors had claimed from Germany a sum of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German mediator, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the rapists feared for their safety.
According to the report, the sequencors wanted to release women from prison after the ransom was paid.
Men would have to remain under arrest until the raptors had a safe escape route.
The German ambassador to Cairo refused a position regarding the report .
The abuses of the patriarch "put him to the murder"
Years of abuse by the patriarch brought a woman to kill herself, she declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, by Stithians, Cornovaglia, was imprisoned for 6 years after he admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he had regularly disturbed his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Tririse wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and living in Covetry, Trerise had a problem and sold her before having sexual relations, while the mother was out to work in a pub.
Tririse and his wife were divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornovaglia.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer to the National Trust, was tortured by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who had been a brave surfist and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that he had "fucked with life".
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
It is thought that he was killed with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle strengthened his daughter's mother, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "The League and the Trader".
"I didn't have sex with him.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Tririse: "She is an extremely strange fetisher, and for her victim she must be a terrible state, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This terrible saga ends with the victim who takes his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't done it, it would have been difficult to finish the facts before the court."
I know the effects that Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter in these years.
"Others were clearly likely to be a promising and happy young success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June has to be charged by the Official Secrets Act, has acquired the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is the less delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal attempt.
The BBC defence representative Frank Gardner said that the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They will have thought that this was dealt with internally at the Mod and at the Office of the Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the information protection clause.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments on al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of his decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
English construction companies could face an account of more than 80 thousand £ after saving Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given 14 billion stars to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savings.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking the money of the savings companies, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Companies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it's "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion stars will be repatriated if Bradford & Bingley's mussels will be withdrawn.
But the interest that will grow in time will be paid every year to 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will grow in time will be due each year to 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is ironic that those institutions that have acted wisely... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The treasurer estimates that interest on loan will amount to 450 million stars in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million stars to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the construction company association, told BBC that he thinks it is unfair.
"It is ironic that those institutions that have acted prudently on the market at home are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions which have been much less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We must examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options are available to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," said Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this may be almost twice as high.
As long as construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk salt at 5 pens per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in prices at the size of his milk for an extra of five pennies per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
The sellers must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANIO) Before the increase in February, the price for the increase changed for the last time in 2002.
Refused to custody of the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court has rejected an appeal for protection from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she may be arrested when she comes back to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to grant them a ban on spending 50 million dollars (729,700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a member of Parliament.
The case is one of many accusations of corruption against you.
The long political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh by Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next week but his party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military should be free of charge.
The respondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she can stay free when she comes back to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected the request for care for Sheikh Hasina leading her to the fact that she can't have the care because she's already abroad on medical care," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq says.
"We shall present or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs protection to return to the country from the outside to prepare the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina's home is expected to return after October 17th, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government joined the military force took power, but was released in June to go abroad to receive medical care.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-polo campaign
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing in the recent immunization campaign due to the violence associated with the Taliban, says the United Nations.
The United Nations has advanced a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that you cannot reach children in the part of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this happened despite the promises of Talibans who would not attack or arrest thousands of staff carrying vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the TV network.
BSkyB was told by the competition court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had said that BSkyB's participation had hampered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV raises doubts about the independence of ITV, making it possible for the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stack was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surprise its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the U.S. prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney-General appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the licensing of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation shall take place when a report is made on the case by the general inspector of the Department of Criminal Justice is the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made out of fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Minister Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to suppress justice.
"Several charges of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or investigated," said general inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special minister with the power to restrict witnesses was one of the main recommendations.
The debate began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers were licensed for cutting performance.
But later it appeared that the licensed lawyers had not been more scrutinised than many other colleagues, bringing many observers to the conclusion that the licensing was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors were involved in judicial action against members of the High-profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic electors.
American prosecutors are investigating and bringing cases before the government in court.
They can be licensed at any time, but can not be licensed for political reasons.
The chief of the Department of Justice, general prosecutor Alberto Gonzales, then found himself in the storm for licences, and finally identified his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice were licensed.
(The report of the General Inspector-General was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the licensings, which he had abused as a leader and had been extremely prominent during the process.
Other officials, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epike Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award to the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to win recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album hit by Meat Loaf in 1977.
The Coldplay will lead the nominations for the awards this year, being in the list of those named in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that pass things like time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained almost nine years in classification and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart beat in 2003.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced it to cancel and concerts.
Get out later that he had a seat on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of adventures, bulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others just for use.
But many Veterans and residents have long found it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, especially because they have never heard of it.
The smallest road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet of width and 120 feet of length, it resembles more dusty visceral than a trafficked activity.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal Atlantic.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the property company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to open Extra Place and create a cleaner pass for shops and shops that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-term neighbors who say they were hit by the narrow road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the ladies' district of the past.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has control of roads, is not interested in having it.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Use of the Land of the Commune Committee on the Environment, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay have drawn up a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers that the road remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to possess Extra Place," he said.
"There may be proposals to system and manage it, which may be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay has been announced many months ago to want to open the small road and install seats, including some to use for a coffee that the real estate company expects to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that he wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this depleted villa and transform it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Accommodation, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than manage it.
In contrast to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a historical impregnated reading.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large agricultural company owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his many children and the strict earthquake was not claimed.
The door on the back of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road may be better known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who made the photo in November 1976.
"It was an immoderate smell, brands of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, leaves, cords."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "generification" of the East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, adding that the part of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a fragment of the city almost for no change that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subscribed, "The Book of Complaints: A Look a little nosstalgic to the city on the way out"), published part of a talk on the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an empty living room without exit, also empty and delimited doors of iron stores and windows with raisins, with old days of weeks flying along the bassifands."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same one last night.
A rat ran closely through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of aristocratic clothing shop.
On the walls there were graffiti and an empty beer bottle from 22 hours close to a group of abandoned daily freshs.
A few people in the past said that they rarely thought of Extra Place, but they suggested it would need to be a bit bold.
Mr Fields, on his part, said that he was thinking that some people also underestimated the attractiveness of the road in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: enlargement in English
In this score of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Iizumi, senior member of the studies in California and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
To attract Spanish voters is really a complicated matter.
The educational projects of Barack Obama are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "the students of African-American and Latin America have significantly less probability of graduating than the white students," it is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitory bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in different languages from English, does not take into account his interest in closing learning gaps.
We take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
School students are for the Spanish majority and low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, one amazing 100 percent of the students did the highest level test in the 2008 math state examination.
Another amazing 93 percent of the fourth students have performed an expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient than that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street highlights the review and exercise, the constant assessment of competences and an attitude of the "no excuse" type.
In addition, and it is here that Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street School, the hostile approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered class 12 months later you wouldn't be able to identify what it was."
"It works," he observed "for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep to replay it in other schools in most Spanish and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-term backdrop of bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevents Mr Obama from predicting the answer.
While he agreed that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the argument when he said that people should stop worrying about the "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these failures, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than reject them or ban them.
Petroleum freezes and renews economic fear
Petroleum prices have been drastically reduced on Monday due to concerns that the US rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The future of the famine has fallen from 7 per cent to 99.80 dollars at the barrier to New York's commercial bazaar in operations in the morning.
Prices have lost more than 20 dollars in the barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the first material markets have been cut off from Wall Street's financial recovery, and from a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a little $145.26 in the barrel in June, the prices were rounded up to nearly $90 at the bar at the beginning of this month, before reselling again on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors on a new Monday even after the congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement at the end of the week about the rescue plan, the biggest of history.
The news has been hidden from the fresh concerns that the financial crisis has been far away from the past.
In the final episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will include the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that the fraternal negotiations last week had led to a rescue agreement " appear to have failed to revive the market feeling.
As the economic situation worsens, we expect the demand for raw materials, including oil, to cool down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that the first materials will not be able to escape from infection.
From a perspective of materials first our most pressing concern is to the point where the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Banking analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year while domestic oil consumption has slowed down the economic growth, reducing oil and gas prices by around 20 per cent for 2009.
The operation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniforms in the last eight and more seasons, defenseer Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched it happen from the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without points into a remount.
"You've seen something like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Cardinals had equaled the grayer of the threatened clouds that prevailed over them with a fun game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-year-old touchdown, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing symphony made a giant step forward.
Favre found Cole for two other touchdowns in the room, including one when a cornerback is lost and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I'm not out of my path," said Favre of all the steps that came to Cole.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think of."
While Favre and Cole played the game, the defense severely attacked Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The Cornerback Darrelle Revis has interrupted a waning launch and has launched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Eric Smith's security has planned another move and has interrupted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner smoker.
The last turnover, the smoke forced by Bowens, could have been the most significant.
The Cardinals have gone for a while on that deck property, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets have recovered the deck with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely has cut a target from 20 yards, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever signed in a room.
When he was asked to describe the peace, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second room or the third room?"
When it was said to him both - the Jets gave 21 points without response in the third room - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second room much more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a little timeless."
Gebrselassie rest over his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown again because many consider it the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the marathon in Berlin on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race well-planned at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sent his previous score at 2:03:26 last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie points to the world's 26th world record of a career that has produced a global championship or a world record at every distance from the millimeter to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie jumped off Pechino's Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively - that air pollution would have made its asthma problems worse.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - single and 48 degrees to departure, 55 degrees to arrival - Gebrselassie has won Sunday with a 4-minute discount and 43 seconds per mile.
Not only half-founders like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat del Kenya have gone to long distances, the maraton record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil came to Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago she had cramps in her pockets and she missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest has left him fresh, unaccompanied.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselassie to the reporter.
"It was perfect.
I started a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at last everything was going well."
It was a little criticised - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - to have overarched its careers, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on apriptics as if it were a race of a deep middle, and putting the world's records on the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely reduce the size of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon.
With the step taken by four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite corridors, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held competition with Gebrselassie after the Appistas were removed.
A little over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made a final commitment to get out of Kambai, which ended at 2:05:36, improving its best personal time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, has completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh time of always.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record at 2:15:25.
The spring course, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprising winner of the Marathon of London at 2:24:14.
The games of Pechino have been lost with what is described as a serious incident, but it has been fought to win in Berlin, making its best personal time for almost five minutes in the third marathon that has run.
She ran a race doing well the calculations, leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan corridors to share with a great distance, taking it about 18 miles and half.
Asscale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the park on an extensive theme on the subborgs of Orlando, a few miles away from the beautiful, from the noise, from the vastness, the quiet city where pride and the complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 brown skins, 300 good fans, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described - and which stops tourists from understanding it in Florida's tourist guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project - remains a part of it.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often refused to share their thoughts with the white man, who "consciously little of us, you don't know what you're losing."
Even now, in a year where a black president, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an open speech on race, many of these remain dependent on the watch of the occupier.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of the city's oldest church.
"You must be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a triumphal parade and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2,400 where the rate of poverty is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the roots of the rural culture of the southern blacks - sometimes disproved, sometimes premiumd - born by the American slave.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Your Eyes We Are Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's leadership transformed the city, just outside the Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a black and human drama scene.
Low as a grancassa in life and in literature, Hurston brought the readers to the store owned by the first union of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, to become more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "it's the modern public school, it's brown with white refinitions, with its well-dressed gardens and courties, where Howard Miller always danced, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the Dash widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds and whatever fits in the passenger rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with analfabetism, second nights and sex.
Obviously this wasn't about Fodor.
In fact, it was not a picture that everyone appreciated.
"Now he said how it was," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters whose Hurston died calling men singing giant songs about their beauty.
Add: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living eccentric who often returned from his family to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalls that when Hurston was pioneering in the city, he usually arrived without warning in a trionfant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is also proud of the dignified dress.
Many people were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were asleep.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, in addition, dondolas on his seat on the back of the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was probably baptized, "he never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were out of print.
In addition to the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although he once was a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 20s, he was buried in a room without a targe in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial ceremony, and no large conference.
"I don't think they understand their contribution to the world or their release to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway through the city to clean up Kennedy Boulevard, the main road to two courses.
The expansion of Orlando has already inspired Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Strong integration, in addition to other things, has brought an end to the relative isolation of the community.
In the fifties, the fight on racial equality brought hatred on the door of the community's home.
"During that period, a group of white boys came and won gold and stuff for the people who were sitting on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who remained killed from that one time.
They got a cook from a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for strong integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "a rather insult than a honour for my race".
Residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite being positive under certain aspects, weakens Eatonville's cohesion and undermines the confidence of its young people.
"The black children used to be dressed - I remember this - you kissed your teacher in the morning, you kissed your teacher at night," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This will take time, it added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, in any way, helped and created space for many others Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame the damages, as he did, with great security of himself and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the empty tomb of Hurston and began fighting for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, an alleged biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway attacked the library caches, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The project of the highway arrived just as his most famous daughter had again worked on the lights of the rebels.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans come to the opening event two years later, and every January, many return to the memorial.
Many years later, I'll take him back from his road project.
"The five courses of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called the high speed, a real pride for the city," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it in a simpler way: "Now he saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project helped change the image the city has.
Those from outside cities like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville added to the public historical record in 1998.
A new library to a single piano (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a newly renovated and dedicated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of the 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
An earlier request for permission is requested for most of the interview, in some things - such as the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who are seeing black men in the camps - have no permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for shining red, are still afraid that their island community will become French.
However, not only has the Hurston festival expanded, it has also developed a high level of civil pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better nor worse, neither worse nor worse, creative, great worker, shocked and confused as other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is a genuine civil love that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work in the local government or for the Department of Police, who said he might need help.
And even younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old ladies from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just come in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after the show in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a grateful city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspapers and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not be inclined to stay in the eye of the cycle.
They would never suggest that the wind offices, at the top of their heads, the bankers and hedge-fund managers who monopolize New York live the worst "worst day in office" from the 1929 clock.
Factors remove metal cartridges for the passing through the marciapies, transporting muffin vessels for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans cross the steps between condoms carrying, like human mollusks, 50 and truck wheels attached to a baton on their shoulders.
The employees are still waiting on their morning luggage on the food carts on the market, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between the 16th and the 19th working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of jealousy and sadness, I decided to open up a new book on saving Thursday afternoon.
Even if I had planned the event so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break to my JP Morgan Chase branch, a piece of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the casino sports hall, to withdraw money or to deposit, but in front of the customer service sports hall, where old customers order free lodgings, tourists ask for directions for the large Macy store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I'd learn from Starr, my "trust banker," were in line for my own reasons.
On the contrary, however, they have already taken the savings from smaller banks from the places where the pendants do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from so-called triffs (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say to treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days the Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkese were headed home for a weekend afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of 440 billion dollars, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and businesses who were in front of me, unaccompanied by another group, were putting their money at a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more charges at Wall Street.
The common New Yorkeses in the last few weeks have become financially competent.
A woman to my Chinese Supermarket of trust, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went missing, and to her emaciated director general Dick Full in all familiarity, as if lying with a bad colleague.
And Lynn, the uniformed portina, almost fifty of my condominium, has changed the subject according to our normal subject of conversation on Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I've changed, I'm not running at any risk."
A profanate Muslim tomb as Austria moves to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left hand side of the Austrian Party of Freedom and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party, took part in a demonstration to present the "Città against Islamization" organization in Anversa, on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry type signs of those Moscow road representatives with a red line passing through the middle.
The police blamed the right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the right-hand side won a lot to the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police thought was an organized action.
The criminals have followed with the Hebrew spray symbols such as David's Star over a few graves, but the detectives believe it might be a attempt to mask the extreme motives led by a hatred for Muslims immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related in some way to the elections.
A spokesman from the local Islamic community said they were "profoundly shocked" by the news of the profession, which occurred at the end of Ramadan, months of religious relevance for Muslims.
In the meantime Austria was en route to a spiritual search following its turn to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme-right parties who have taken almost 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian freedom party and the Austrian Alliance for the Future, have made a campaign with frequently anti-immigrants and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, has campaigned against the winds and the burkas and has also expressed his opposition to food that is perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European fraternity" to prevent Islam's growth.
Both parties seem to flag the construction of museums and mines, leading to political symbols of a continuing Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis took place immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the strongest political block of the nation, indicating that the change was brought to the top by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star of sexual abuse on minors, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain by court.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities that they wanted to go to Spain from France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after he gave the judges the evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse on minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's award in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman from the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's award, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's trip outside France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't presenting himself."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities of his wishes to travel abroad as required by the register of convicted persons for sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police a warning of seven days on his scheduled departure date.
The lack of notification to the authority may lead to a sentence of five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said they didn't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A police officer from Kent said: "Kent's police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have adequate full systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protection of Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we will work closely to monitor the conduct of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country in order to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom the last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two 10 and 11-year-olds.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he had to sail on a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made it through the passport check and finally took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not allow him to enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he should return to England.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow's 3rd Terminal on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Prize in West London since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to enter him in the register of convicted for sexual offences.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having had images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt confident and happy that Glitter was stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher far from the scene to alienate the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Don't touch it, don't fly it, don't live in it.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, mirrored by the concentration that characterizes interpretation, to look at the man or woman’s release.
On the other hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable facts, except in private, at those times far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alters the theatre of some paintings in singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the least known side of these masters.
To this end, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, taking it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, including in the programming of the Month of the Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this ball, every day ever greater," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be treated by common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists, interpreters or performers on the scene.
These people depicted as "the street island" are "Artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are in scene ... and to capture the public.
In order to collect the personality of these great ones, it is not necessary to draw them in a scene,
Because their personality and character are inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture the personality of the large flamenco with the camera."
With the passion for the "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long trip towards singing songs, guitarists or balloons using a camera on the back in 1997.
They are pictures that, due to the type of machine and material, they remember classical photography.
The application of various stylist techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, confers on the modernity photo, according to an idea reflecting the concept of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that develops and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or singing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, is capable of winning the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way to feel and be, and have been the constant of this work, in these days at the El Fotomata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are in this selection of about 70 artists depicted.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the pictures displayed on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for the photos led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject".
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "We admire people, know them and can penetrate them for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the picture is the most difficult type in photography.
You meet or face people, characters who sometimes don't even know you or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture out.
Besides these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concreteize my ideas."
The collection of photos of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is attached to the El Fotómata gallery, on the 20th of the route of the Mata, parallels to the Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa realizes that the novel he's writing is a "zzardo"
It is roomed in places that still does not know and deals with unknown arguments: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is at the stake with a new project to which he is working, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for twenty years and has passed through the Amazon.
Since always favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project you are currently working on is "a donkey" and that "all indicates you shouldn't write it."
"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it as well and hope to finish it as before," he concluded his intervention at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he had seen for four days for the city of Acquedoto a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La Ciudad y los perros" was, as predictively, the figure for the third edition of the speech festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of Hay Festival to be the most voted writer – an ancient edition of the book "Our mutual friend" of Dickens, has completed the places of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public to whom the time was running when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of umorrhage, called out as he was born in him the literary appeal derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "reading" and "to live beyond what I live"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "inspiration lack", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous recovery; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his vocation and as "the images of the memory" are the basis on which his accounts are based.
The Spanish-American novelist, he acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an effective experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, saying that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "makes the most anticonformist people." Therefore he invited the writers to "do not give up" and to "take responsibility" for their calling.
The time stops the Pozoblanco Festival, holding it in the corridors
The celebration of the corridors that should have suggested the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday, after the towers selected for the corridors had verified that the conditions on the floor of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in accordance with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The summers were held against this festival, preventing two days from celebrating on three occasions.
Saturday, the plague prevented the execution of the second race of towers.
In the archives were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Baptista, who had to face a tower of Castileblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had only scheduled events on Friday.
On this occasion Daniel Luque was to trionfare, drawing three ears and coming out in a trionfo, after having torturing with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante brought to an end his two races at risk of health and a hearing, given more to the public than for the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the arena of Los Llanos without honor and no punishment.
With the second bull, after a horrendous fly, the fish of most of the public has been obtained.
A car with two thousand kilos of hashish over the block location in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
The agents aim at the top of the two employees of a van that instead of stopping, they run away.
The agents threatened the height to two drivers of a car that, instead of stopping, were given to the flight.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After following them, the agents are able to arrest one of the two employees, a man of about 28 years of age, identified as A.A.J., as reported in the report of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident was verified when some of Alava's road officials were carrying out a transport control on N-1, in which they crossed the territory of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a vehicle for inspection when the driver, crossing orders, hurriedly speeded up and crossed the block.
The agents were escorted until the vehicle, after a couple of miles, stopped on the road and its two employees fled to a forest area.
The agents of Erzzaintza were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and to trace the 2,178 kilograms of Hashish that they carried and took on once inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The Hashish panettes, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently put under police custody for a deep investigation and the detection of weight.
In addition, since the officials confirmed that the matrix was "doubled" because it did not match that reported in the vehicle documentation, the ban was also imposed on the falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing trials to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the sequential drug.
A. A.J., 28 years old, was taken to the police station to conduct the proper proceedings and to be available to the judge in the next hours.
Arrested the actress Heather Locklear for guidance under the effect of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for guidance under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw him perform dangerous maneuvers while trying to get out with the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a driver of the California street.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "slashed the accelerator in the background, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with brown manoeuvre ahead and back. Making a retreat, he passed more times in front of his eyes from the sun."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first seemed to have not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear was stopped on a nearby road and was out of the vehicle.
This person was warning emergency services, because "he was concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his car, which partially blocked the road.
"It seemed confused," and for that reason the agents have led it to a specialized drug and alcohol centre to submit it to a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was shown to be collaborative and the hypotheses of alcohol abuse have been eliminated since the beginning, even though "as observed by the officials at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of leadership under the effect of some of the no better specified substances and was sent to the local prison about 19 a.m. to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, the Locklear was restored by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Calleres requests the long-term IU Federation to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the United Party, Gaspar Llamazares, has confirmed today that he will expect the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of former assistant to the Youth and Sport of the City of Sevillia, Francisco Manuel Silva, who has appointed the resignations next week following the claim of customerism.
"In these cases there are particularly federalists, and it will be the long-term organisation to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party should adopt against what has been to date satisfactorily in the Civil Council.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of test to be the maximum transparency."
In the same way, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"Sangre de Mayo", the Episcopal Cosmetics of Garci
In inspiration to Episodios Nationales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci recommends the famous revolution of Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director has tried to "show the torrent of characters and at the same time social analysis" which has always admired the work of the famous Romance, has explained today during the presentation of the film, with Kim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría as head of a wide range of interpretations.
Blood of May, more than two and a half hours, starts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television ministry over four hours in the future on TeleMadrid.
The great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have done this "a dream of his childhood", and he believes that he should be grateful to Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community had commissioned him three years before he was filming a memorial film for the second century of May 2rd. The registrant had agreed that the history of basses on the Roman Episodios Nationales was based.
The 15 million budgets allocated throughout the Madrid Community have represented Garci as a "one chance" for Garci to acquire the proper scenarios and customs to defeat a "a tough Spain that failed the choice of leader to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a tremendous delay in development under the Kingdom of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director failed to receive funding similar to those of Alatriste or Los Fantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de May, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided for by the script he himself signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the Rever registries to begin, has influenced what is their practice of normal work, the stage with the actors, with which they often use to try to get together with those who will not be part of the castle, because they consider it "submissive," considering that "part of the work of the registrant lives in the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the interpreters, some of whom come into the Sangra de May castle, try their car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
A candidate for Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci considers that none of the three film candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Blood de May, Seven Masses de billar francés and, the last one selected The gyrisoles ciegos -, they do not represent the younger generation of the Spanish cinema "that should rather be known."
From this film Garci doesn't expect a prize.
"At first you believe to work for the later, then you realize that you are only working for prosperity, and at some point you agree to simply turn a movie into more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon discovers the civil essence of the Ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Civil Ballerina makes a tribute to another ballerina as well as Sivillaa.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, a Catalan father (Frenze Tortola Ferrer) and an Andalusa mother (Georgia Valencia Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in Triana district, and at the age of three he moved with the family to London.
It was a ballerina of free dance and a specialist in Oriental dances.
He led an exciting life and was a pioneer of the female embezzlement, of the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and he defended the cause of the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who opposed a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always highlighted Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gamboa and she's offering me this character.
It supports the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell his whole life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the bride" suggested to me a guru, or "the dance of the serpent" some tanhi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also returns to this aesthetic," he explains.
The scene includes two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as he does in "The Open Door"; and that of Master Matilda Coral, who had an extraordinary desire to work with what was his ally.
"Matilde interprets Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I'm happy that you agreed to work in my work, and I feel very honored about this."
The amplification also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Ariaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi di Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who interprets the role of the eternal accompanying of these artists who were all due, and who have always had a lot of fun."
It is also in some ways presenting the life of this woman who lives far away, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, because, usually, she lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think that she was one of the women who had a huge influence in a historical period and now no one remembers her and no one remembers her work as much as something valuable," says Bayon.
The show will begin today at 20.30 at Lope de Vega's theater.
With the publication of "Diario de un a married poet" the Trinity is also closed
The presentation of the first edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Assadorate to the Culture of the Youth of Andalusia to celebrate the "Thirennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Thirennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the revision of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Chopo de luz", which was opened last May and that, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, it is planned to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Association of Culture of the Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un reciencasado Poeta", in the care of Pietro Taberero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the spread of the figure and the work of one of the well-known poets of higher value.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who I'll work with him in "Ausencia de Malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the inconclusive idea that Newman went.
Even so, it took him a lot to get an Oscar.
And since 2007, he's been retired.
And he knew he was very sick too.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and now I lost a big friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid to turn or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and patriotism died at a particularly dark moment, because of the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on earth, to search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When the times are so difficult, men such without virtue and remain good people to admire, it does not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he wore the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a defender of the causes of corruption and twenty, from the foundation for the fight against drug created in honour of the first-generation death of overdoses to the creation of the casaling and biological food brand.
All gifts to a country where it is a great challenge to go beyond a dead food culture.
The surprise wave went beyond Hollywood, without healing from nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man didn't die, it's been a while.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, a registered director with Oscar, said working with Newman made nothing less than his career.
The captive boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, was eager to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of a high level for all of us," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: maintaining high regard for the need for correction and having a serious and distant private life in the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some have tried, and Paul Newman is a good example for us.
He divorced once, but remained married for five years with Joanne Woodward, who remained faithful until he had certainly missed the opportunity to not be.
"Why am I going to eat out of hamburger today, if I have a drink at home?" he said to himself.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his miracles, which is not so common in America.
"With all the great roles that he interpreted, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, not insultated and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect course of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that before or after the Olympics arrive in Madrid and, after the 2012 failed attempt, this could happen in 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's course, you'll say no!
They called him the "perfect course", but I think the worst thing I've ever seen was a long way off.
A lot of shocks, which, if followed, took account of the assessment act and I had to examine it, would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The shocks began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed they would go first.
It didn't seem a wrong idea, but if you're forced to go, it's to withdraw everything (including the chip to avoid the codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first shock, go only for this) and (after the relevant code), surprise! they had only a skeletal 'S' (second shock, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
It is a crime of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small butter, made with less fabric and thus less expensive?
Well, things like this are started on the very day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the waiting code was 15 minutes and, for more, you had to deposit it.
The waiting period is more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a course of more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was expected, the course was started that we had not even yet deposited the goods, although, once successful in the company, recovery was even worse.
In addition, the plague threatened the waiting for more than 40 minutes, to add attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have the pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct classification because of the chip that, assuming it didn't correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect course, this will not come into my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search recipient (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case described by Microsoft, a navigation service to stay inside the society's campus) by helping the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a form recognition system, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - even to remember their position in the company - and to listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group the participants in the conversation groups.
In the video for example, the receptionist finds a third person, but he realizes that he does not belong to the group he's talking to and that he's not a company dependent.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him he'll be there soon.
All without blue screen.
That's impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now society has better focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had the essential functions and less commercial space, they would be five times faster – hey! Steve will be for "the less".
All a discovery, if it is considered that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change in direction is commendable.
Microsoft has reason: the operating system is becoming increasingly important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported Google's theory that was the first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not a operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software communication.
You have the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to the nun.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is only taken to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and we spend more time daily browsing in networks than in a window-removing environment.
What do half of the operating system's applications serve?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, very less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is interested in more integration of its online services in order to create a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I'll report a little example here.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the resorts for Microsoft employees, in Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the baby machine a folder requests you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to perform online research.
Last week, of course, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is painful.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it in the cost of Azzurra, Leonardo di Caprio reflected in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de blood', as well as Al Pacino's 'Padrio' in Francis Ford Coppola' in addition to being part of the typical uniform of the gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of stars, we can repeat the image of the force with the attached buffs that raise weights in the ambulatory circle.
It is, in substance, of the typical man-made migliette, with the inside of cotton, atylated and without manicins.
It's the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, though, the Belgian Fabulaux Marcel spits over all of them.
The "Marcel" is superior to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex size, for its distinctive taste and for the small Belgian flag (recognisable) that the most emblematic models of butter carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" is superior to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex size, for its distinctive smile and for the small Belgian flag (recognisable) that the most emblematic models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian tooth is not only about the famous "tank".
It also includes hats for college, back boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, seamstress, baby-dolls, mini short...
Immediate beverages thought to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an intimate white man.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't care."
The great sympathy with the sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
At present, the Cruz sisters have taken their new activity seriously in the field of fashion.
For Monica, I'm much more than beautiful girls and celebrity who give their own name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that signature Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes than the Spanish fashion house sponsorship.
He's warm and scared, he's quick to win you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to introduce the new collection that we have thought of my sister Penelope and me for the autumn-minor season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, it's exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango take place in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Whether my sister likes the 50s or 60s, we get a lot of inspiration from here.
Then I love to lose myself in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do so often.
Ballerina, attractive and stylist, you're a very brave woman, aren't you?
I think yes, even though at the end, everything is confusing and there are many elements in common.
From childhood, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to feed my aunt's arms and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the park games.
Then, once in a ballerina, I've always paid a lot of attention to dress.
You know, the whales love to have their own style to go to school and to know, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of attraction, when you are given the guard is the moment you really meet the character.
So it's all going together, yes, with a lot of respect for the stylists and professionals.
Not long ago, you worked 30 years, you got into a crisis?
But no.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that time women are mature and have a good experience to gain life by committing fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted to do, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to become a mother, right?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because she asks me for my own body and I also want to be a young mother, this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and teach him a lot of love.
As far as the film is concerned, you are expected to be in the various rooms of some film filmed last year.
That's right, and I really want them to be.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I want everything right away and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want it to be "The Last Time" and "In Search of the Tamba of Christ."
We'll see if you'll like it.
A few days ago, you started on the walker with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was in the passport as a model.
It is simply Naomi Campbell, who has known me for a long time, who has invited me to go to London to participate in a charity campaign for his organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes that we have shown – I have brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – have been put to the beach to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this side of Naomi's.
They say so many things about you, that I know for a long time I can assure you that I'm not that true.
In addition, I find this good part in which she is involved.
He asked me to scream for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pen, I would do the same.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't get back.
Returning alcoholics will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for an excessive rate of alcohol in the blood to install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a state of emergency or if not in the device position.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Prosecutor-General of State, according to which it will be a pilot project of the duration of a year.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this should take a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Road Safety Directorate General, they will take part in this initiative by the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technology Institute for Car Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of car drivers reported more than once for leadership in the state of emergency then return to drive the car.
Alkolock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the spirited air and prevents the engine from putting in the car if the driver does not support it, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that permitted.
The cost is above EUR 1000 and would be liable to the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles in question are able to reduce to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to punish these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate their development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, of course, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in some commercial solutions, even if it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
In the morning, the Congress of Members will vote for a PSOE initiative which proposes to install this system in schools' buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, second programme, the Spanish plane in which the principles of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential district of Benito Juárez, Mexico City.
The sun was moving, but the rays still forced them to use their hand as he saw the real couple get off the plane.
At the feet of the scale, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
Some time ago I had asked a taxi driver, for the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time ... You're from here or...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
The Mexican press, however, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport range on the red tape and military cordon consisting of 27 marine soldiers who offer the salute.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very proud, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they have referred to her as a serious threat to Mexico City.
They give the photographers a smile and a short pause before passing through the room where they are expected to be taken by the official committee.
At the hotel door where they live, one of the four largest cities, awaits them as a spiritual reporter of Mexican television.
The best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the most suitable world to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and there is probably no smarter stylelist and good living by Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to promote international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched his designs in Mango's wine at the 54th Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and was almost overwhelmed by emotion.
In addition, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square metres of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, together with the desire to please the Valentino stylist who was the leader of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most scissors, the presidential table of gala prepared by Mango, it became even more spectacular.
Nati, with the infamous heart and doing justice, because of the brother's recent death, wore a home and some ELAH supplements to take away the bag and the arm of the son of Luis - a boy of almost two meters tall - accompanied Valentino to the chairmanship of the lunch dinner.
Andik, owner and gentleman of Mango, has made the house and horses that he has finished, along with Barone Rotchil, without a jacket, because they both had sent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the store in pants and trucks – designed by her hand – was transformed for dinner, wearing a long black habit very sensitive and was excited during the evening walk accompanied by Goya Toledo in the work, when they showed us the bathroom for ballet shoes and she, remembering other times, held a bar and covered a "great floor".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the places of the palace, but he showed us pictures of his son on the cell.
The next day we met with Olivier Martinez's presence – another boy who moved into the motor – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his lenzuola, his shelters, and had been assured in advance, that we would not have been in his room.
Stelle under Paris' stared sky.
Oh, that's life.
1001, anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the caottic and frenetic daily life.
And as if this wasn't enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring the relax in the books on September 30th.
The candle is almost a punishment when it shines every morning at 7:00, but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the sudden rhythm of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's bad skin.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two ways to combat everyday harassment and the fact that they are separated from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or "spa", Susannah Marriottt gathers in the pages of his book, all a "menu" of options on the basis of taste and time for each.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its peace will reach the libraries thanks to editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to win peace in areas such as working or personal relationships, this "manual" will undermine that conviction.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as contacting nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relax.
If the adrenaline is no longer running in your veins to find the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, reflect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk to the sound
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not refer to those who are very anxious to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who are talking about being asleep.
The first time it happens, at most it takes a sleepover, but it doesn't really matter much.
This is a benene alteration of the dream defined by the dream.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have told me that you spoke in the dream.
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (one time in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember any more.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes associated with other sleep disorders such as incubation, nighttime fear, night sweating (beginning the nappie), or sleeplessness, but it is not necessarily so.
As mentioned earlier, it can be associated with very high fever rates, stressful situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it's still a little studied phenomenon.
Also the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a tone of very quiet voice, with words of silence, almost in a surrogate or that the opposite (wheat, cry, long talk ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check whether there are some issues that are causing an abnormal state of concern as a result of the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that may be treated (for example, if accompanied by sleep disorder or stress).
What can be done, however, is taking into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exaggerate the child before he goes to bed.
To propose peaceful games and avoid programs or television series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is convenient to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sounds appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are infective for the child and that the day after that will not remember anything about what happened.
Practical advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because it's not aware of what's happening, and you stopped dreaming.
Although he's talking, he's asleep and so he's resting.
Remember that if you appear very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check out where such a concern comes from in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the attempt to make an inquiry to get information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep and so he's not conscious to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions they might bring.
Never tell the child you can ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not at all.
Something like that causes enormous anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illustrating... finally
The Illhaeuusern finally found the road of victory at home after a long infuriated period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Giallo-neri have created the largest number of network opportunities to transform one into the victory of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this encounter in which the attackers expressed themselves in fact.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann team who had fired the seventh with a distant shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and after the other caused the defense of Dannemarie, Funderflick from far away, then Hirn, Roman of Point and yet Diebold.
Dannemarie answered with a block in the center of the camp, leaving only the retreat of Rihai at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initials signed by Rihai and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeuusern, well placed, he took a stand against a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the cannon of the Illhaeuusern will not be able to capture his long-term happiness and will be released a dozen minutes after leaving his team associates in numerically inferiority.
But Dannemarie won't be able to use it and will not cause great problems to the Illhaeusern's Undicies, which was just dealt with to "enforce" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocambolic action, the ball broke through.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in the hills
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Britain.
The President of the Republic decided to relocate to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that he would "be present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit, which is currently taking place with the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to deal with the fuel price commitment, has reached its record with an average of more than €1.14 per litre.
According to Elisio David Martin, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain their competitiveness and make sure the conditions of work and the remuneration of the mariners are secure".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stop.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out the "jump operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections with Belle-Île were not interrupted.
A road block was carried out on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the mariners had already demonstrated their determination by burning, from the sky, pneumatics and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the gates of Brest and Lorient, while they held demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishermen remained at the molo, or at Havre, where a wind of battalions prevented the movement of ships from moving from trade.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at Loira Atlantica, interrupted the block of the total refinery note by Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation of the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fishing committee's officers, who did not support the movement.
"I will continue" because "fishers won't drop" and "does not intend to stay in Paris," he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the yield limit for a storage is only achieved with a gas of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of Butch Cassidy died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and yet Sam Mendes have saluted the legend of the film and plays committed by Paul Newman, who was 83 years old.
The Embraer maintains the delivery forecasts in 2008
The building company of aircraft accounts for 215 delivery this year, despite the threats of recession recorded on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world company in the sector, maintains the delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, he delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian company is widely trusted in the Chinese market, especially for the range airs between 30 and 120 locations.
So far, Embraer has been delivered in eight years 41 cars to Chinese customers.
AIG would deliver more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, released on foot by the U.S. monetary authorities, would spend more than 15% of its activities in order to reimburse the loan of $85 billion, according to the daily edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the transfer of life insurance frameworks to the international market and to the United States, needs the daily on the basis of sources more than volunteers.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to review any delays, according to the FT.
No confirmation was received at the AIG.
The activities that the AIG intends to grant include the International Lease Financial Corp airline, its share equal to 59% of Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these issues, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion grants from the Federal Reserve, in order to see the US authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: Chronicles Morning Meeting
New York's Borsa accused a historic cront of Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives expressed itself against Paulson's plan to save the financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. an invisible failure, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) is completed at 10,365.45 points below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) exceeds that of 17 September 2001, on the day of the reopening of the Bors following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1.983.73, and the expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 lost 8,81% (or 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, with final closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the sitting, Wall Street is expropriated after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by the Minister of the Treasurer, Treasury Henry Paulson.
About two republics on three have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All of this indicates how the market accounts for the project," he added, fearing that within a few days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually fatal (...) then the witness would be passed quickly to the Fed – Federal Reserve- (the Central Bank of America, etc.) and to other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," Brian Bethune, responsible for the financial and economic sector at Global Insight.
And highlighting the state of emergency," every day leading to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, she underlined Piegza.
Following the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organised the purchase of Wachova’s banking activities by the rival City Group.
In Europe, the crisis has kindly accelerated, calling for emergency intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, saying that markets are "not only in the face of an American crisis, but in a global crisis," the FTN analyst added.
The compulsory market has been severely successful.
The 10-year-old Grandfather's income is reduced to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while that with 30-year-old is 4,161%, against 4,357% of the previous day.
Obama in favour of the first TV show
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, there is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the republican and democratic campaign have declared their victory over TV duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to slow down in the polls for five weeks from the presidentials.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives a advantage of five points in Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrats had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on an independent sample of voters found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, waiting during the first and only debate with the rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
"Assessing it would be a mistake.
It's a good idea," yet Bill Clinton warned this week-end.
Senator McCain has never failed to promote his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "intensity" of the adversary with regard to the arguments encountered during the first phase.
"Senior Obama doesn't seem to understand what..." he often said many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills necessary to become president," he assured.
What has been a constant debate for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, in his song, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without prolonged exposure, it has been shown to be concious and precise.
It has promoted its preposition to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama," he said, this weekend, a democratic spot, reproducing to the Republican that he has not taken the necessary measures to address the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the nine minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he complained yesterday Obama, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a battalion, for an election meeting.
He did not even utter the words "medium class" or "laborators". The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the gold of precipice.
"The next week might represent a decisive turn," he considered yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an ex-member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's economic outlook to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crown "is the final green after eight years of heavy economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
With regard to the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's findings, the Senator of Illinois has also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of any country's energy independence thanks to the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, by his side, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates have raised the questions focused on the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday at Congress and extremely improvised.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents appeared on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to answer in advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred of the Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening after the closing of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to express themselves against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they haven't even voted: "To whom? They will do what they want from my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good start to foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the ban on seeing 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
I didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to take part in the vote," Iouri Potemkine, the representative of the Union of the Democratic Forces, complained about a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change of facet, Mr Milinkievitch points out, former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidentials and the leaders of the pro-European movement, since it is important to know who the schedules are and in this case is the executive.
If opposition members enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament may include a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has the right to enter the political game because "it is necessary to start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt with Russia, is in crisis, and we are not making any reforms, we are at risk of becoming a protected Russian.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the security organisation and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the clause.
It underlines that participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has given way to every type of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Asks social-democratic leader Alexander Kozouline, one of the last two free political prisoners this year, in August.
There was no one in the electoral trails.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those most suitable for power."
The nightly silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are working on their success.
The meeting - The blood is again safe
The Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dott.sa FrancineDécary, had all the reasons to relax, as Hema-Québec became one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he has recovered the confidence of the public, seriously rooted in the bloodshed scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been infected by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the people, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994 by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the prosecution of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in writing a report, some provinces have set up a committee with a view to creating a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec began his activities, nearly 38% of the people said to feed still trust in the donations system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Ssa Décary.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood clots and research on the field over the years, we have regained public confidence," he explained before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
The Dott.sa Décary, however, is convinced that "trust is extremely fragile."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases in Europe of the human variant of the mollusks, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's mollusc, which has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we never knew if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelinau reports, according to which, when they have doubts and may have serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease that occurs with a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, takes exceptional measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was rejected.
Now, a few years ago, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has thus shown us that it has made sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the identification of HIV was presented on the market: tests of nuclear acid (TAN) that allow donors to recognize directly the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, which were based on the tests used so far.
TANs have allowed the window period to be reduced, i.e. since the person has contracted the disease to that in which the first viruses can be identified in blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to a period less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and of not being able to identify them is thus significantly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of anti-AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, over 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV infection.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected by the HIV virus.
As Héma-Québec distributes every year between 400 000 and 500,000 blood samples, we will want more than 24 years before we encounter a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion.
I believe that today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of Hema-Québec's direction.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Réunion that, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
Hema-Québec must also provide them with sufficient caution before continuing to stress that, in addition to having safe resources, hema-Québec must provide them.
"Requires are increasing because the elderly population is growing.
Because the cures against the most aggressive cancer are often needed by patients with red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the number of donors who constitute only 3% of the people of Quebec eligible as donors."
However, all healthy people who have worked 18 years and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In the medium, 14% of the people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because AIDS or malaria attacks, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where this last is spread, they will be rejected for a period equal to one year.
"With this 3% we can keep an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
The cases of pensions are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor group that they are older and cannot make donations anymore.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but especially to treat them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so freaky that it's hard to find an hour to give blood," says Elaine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, of which bone transplants, eyecardial valves and skin that are used almost exclusively for severe rashes.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec, which manages the only public bank of Ombelical cordon blood in Quebec.
In the bone marrow, which once was considered a biomedicine, there was plenty of rich blood of stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the introduction into the bank of our sweetest blood sample of cordon blood and planned to take it more than a thousand years ago.
You should start offering them for the tractants at the beginning of the next year," says Dr.ssa Décary, who describes this practice of bleeding cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are reluctant to have access to you," because Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and cost-effective program in all Quebec hospitals.
Calcio - The Impact in Semifinal
The Impact Montréal was qualified for the semifinals of the A series, winning 3-1 against Seattle's Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive game of the four finals at the Saputo Stadium.
Central champion Antonio Ribeiro, has signed the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time without goal from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino identified the following networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We remember that on the first day of the journey back, Friday, the Impact had immediately a 2--1 sconfat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle perimeter.
The Impact will confront the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifinals.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thungler set a first 3-1 in the return game, winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to deal with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed on the day.
In brief - Kovalev’s decisive network
The Canadians and their axles are ready to resume the season.
The third format by Alex Kovalev, Thomas Pleanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, made two steps, and collected a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
I decided to win the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned Russia.
I need another game to feel my action."
"He tried to punish in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the success of the game.
There was a great ovation."
Charrest Point to the North
The first minister does not exclude the launch of elections before the end of the year.
In conclusion, the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest said yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to make himself elected on the occasion of today's partial elections.
"To extend the boundaries of our last great northern border": this long-term ambition of Jean Charrest, presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments from the strong visual impact, at the time of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mulino to Images".
On three main screens, they were surrounded by negative displays of hydroelectric diamonds, mineral cultivations, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", cartoons, etc.
Large means as in full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the first minister refused to exclude the opening of the autumn elections, even though he noticed that he was very busy.
The "Piano Nord" is the fourth point of a "project" that the first minister claims to have for Quebec, a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
The opening of the Northern Territory to the 49th parallel was often mentioned in the recent talks of the Prime Minister.
However, the first minister was limited in explaining that the North would be "a joy from the enormous potential", but it was not spoken of as temporary or investment quotas, as it did not explain what the precise priorities for future projects would be.
More and more, it has been limited to indicate what it considers to be a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mineral sector, which has experienced various improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
Being on the list styled by Charrest, the North contains "Nichel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That's the "great territory the double of France," it's here, it's Quebec.
It's not just here, but it's in us," he insisted, as he wanted to request a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the febre of gold in Abitib, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's our future," he added, after a theatre break to observe the huge card in his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has clarified the first minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which there is no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will withdraw that position in the name of the government," he said.
The rest, "considering climate change, needs to reassess the North," he said about the North-West Pass, which will be open for all year because of the ice melting.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory."
And the people of the place, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project should meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-deputed PQ of Ungava), have already taken the lead in consulting a community of thirty.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) has undertaken an important task, has begun its work.
The first minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would depend on the remaining principles of sustainable development.
The North Piano will be concerted, ordered and respected," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuation with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who have preceded us, we know different ways of transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the current themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to overthrow the Beauharnois Centre in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, Creator of Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who nationalized hydroelectricity in Bouursa, founder of Baia James, our party has always been able to predict the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference was made this time, the "Strade to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, first minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the project on Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric diga, Charest stated that its function would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his soldiers, raising bitter feelings.
In fact, the first minister, who claimed that in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not withdraw the possibility of launching a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines that it must be very committed, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the End of the Week has provided the Liberal Capitol with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed as oil: the PLQ calls for the recognition of "Quebec's specificity" in the Constitution.
It is also hoped that Quebec will have the names of members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and that they will have the right to vote on the decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the draft of the North Piano was heard in a sceptical way.
PQ leader Pauline Marois responded to the Development Policy of the North Quebec, launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which arrived in power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he did, "we'll progress today" said Marois to the candidate of Jean-Talon (scrutinous today), Françoise Mercure.
The DQ said to support the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope is that all of this is not just perceived as a show," commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, in the back of today's holiday.
Letter - Unshade
It was Vic Toews, former minister of the "Giustizia" (serious irony) of the Harper office, to let himself say, the short summer, that Louise Arbor was a "dangerous" for Canada.
In this way, a woman who has fought indiscriminately for justice and who deserves all our admiration tells us a lot about both the prime minister's entourage and the Stephen Harper himself.
This is the first time to a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, to have not restored a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that has nothing to do with the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time the impotences occurred.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, renews its word and lets a child soldier be marked in human terms.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, as an informant, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers, in particular, call upon Omar Khadraffin's repatriate to be subject to a regular process in Canada.
It is the same government that closes the eyes of the beginnings of torture: it matters very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of abuse.
It is not yet taken into account, but we are assisting in an insiduous erosion of our rights, freedom and 'democracy', the word that Harper does not cease to resist and that sounds so insensible on his lips.
Here we come at a time when there are no more morals: we can deal with, torture, arbitraryly imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government so far as to be minority (see what will happen after October 14th...).
A number of voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, respect for the Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has abandoned what constitutes the reputation and dignity of our country.
It's just the shame, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian speech of the Barrick Gold
In the September 17th edition, Le Devor published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, this latter claims that the world's largest affier company has carried out a six million-disfamous campaign against three authors and a small semi-trailer house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a petition for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantive difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for the Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to the robin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to it.
Little is the outcome of the process, the authors and the editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a huge amount of money to organize their defence and fight, to a very undisputed weapon against an army of lawyers financed by practically unfunded tasks of the mining company.
Finally, in these wars against unarmed weapons, tactics are often the thing to break the agreement in order to impose a consensus regulation that imposes the opposition on anyone who wishes to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was a change to the public opinion that he had to present his own view of the facts.
In contrast to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada, debates are normal with exchange of views and not with manoeuvres.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open up its books, documents, and establish a true and well-debated, through journals, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the matter.
But the Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and is in a bad way rejecting the requests and letters supported by the authors of Canada Black.
Maybe Garver could explain how he can ask for a public debate when his contempt for the same public is clear?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the profusely paid lawyers and not to the whole of the Canadians; here is a very limited vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the demigrants have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Black does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways adopted by the mining company.
This public is ready to listen to the Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinions, and not in the look of what many recognize as a sort of embassity (seeking the "public debate", the Barrick Gold has just given Canadian authors a finalum in order to support the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the seeker sport by the Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of the truth, which is essential in every democratic society.
It denied the right to mention authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss issues that are similar to the richest businesses in the world, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Canada Black do.
He's got the right to repeat.
For a long time, the university environment, which we are part of, is able to manage debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of the Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate.
This goes beyond the university world, as well as the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments take measures to limit abuse.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the Capitols of Congress, represented by the republican and democratic painting, finally reached an agreement on the largest saving-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion US dollars, which aims to bridge the financial crisis that takes months on Wall Street, is still to be ratified by the two Congressrooms.
In particular, it provides for verification of its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses punished for missing payments, as well as a right to inspect the remuneration paid to the directors of the protected companies.
The US Secretary to Tesoro, Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative are present at the table of the Treaties, Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day treaty marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to save the economy and the American people from the crisis at Wall Street."
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, imaginative frustrations and turmoil would have turned around the Americans' daily life," said journalist Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the Treaties was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The deadline given was corresponding to the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates to the American Presidency later joined the treaty, however, showed little favour to the agreement, without avoiding expressing their discontent with the adoption of extreme solutions.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama is entitled to add some provisions to the agreement, in particular what will enable the owners to maintain their own home and the income to pay for business directors covered by the State.
"When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibilities of others, there is nothing to be ashamed of.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he would vote in favour of the plan, his opponent, John McCain, answered: "I would like to examine the details, but I hope so."
"As I read it, it's something that we all have to say and that will allow us to move forward."
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion aims to recover with the money of contributors the double credits, risk-related and unsustainable assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the purpose of a real estate bubble that has led first to the collapse of mortgage credit (mutui), then to extend to other broader forms of credit securities (PCA) and to collapse liquidity and bank and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge of sending the first draft of an agreement to the air last week.
It seems like it has been out of that secret neighborhood since the Democrats have agreed that the "toxic" asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at Congress, a provision was added which, if the government had to deal with losses during the five years to come because of this programme, could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for a first sum of 250 billion which may be added to another 100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The budget of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
Instead of its aid, Washington will receive shares of participation in protected companies that will close the dividends in case of profit and that will be resale when the waters are calmed.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the taxation procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and start-up payments paid to the directors of the undertakings involved.
From now on, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that the free way will be given to their plan.
In fact, there were several votes against the project yesterday, both in the republics and in the republics.
"Of course, Washington doesn't feel you," said Mr. Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Commission to his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But I'm not sure to take advantage of contributors.
Leader of a small group at Congress called "the caucus of the sceptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but leads to the same conclusion.
"How many outstanding economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us: we ask the Congress not to bring a complex conclusion and carefully examine the way to take it," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, one more time was faced with the evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would have given up on its competitors, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of Europe's largest banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"It's not money lost, said the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wooter Bos yesterday.
On the contrary, there is a risk of influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It's certainly something that rescuers and families appreciate now that times are false."
During this period, at the other end of Manica, the British government seems to be in a position to nationalise another bank in a car for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be charged with the total of current loans at Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that she would be buying the subsidiaries and customers of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to raise a nationalisation process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time his ass in his hand, for others his weak point.
You were released from the Narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the amplifier smile?
No, it's not.
His discretion, sensitivity, and evident talent would have evicted him from that circle of power devoted to the true and sacred displays.
But what a cost!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Ranch of Connecticut, following a lung cancer, remains one of the last signs of American cinema in recent years.
The least monumental of Brando, to whom he seemed to have been a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his game, certainly more fragile, but also to him, who was also responsible for freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
The mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the father of a German Hebrew father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots, one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last brand of quality.
Because in it he recognized all a country occupied by the safe Made Man, the warrior of the war of the Pacific, the hero in the fight, who, at the beginning of the 50s, studied dramatic art in Yale, subsequently attended the actor Studio of New York, before trionfing in theater, on television and near the cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the motorist pilot who was classified according to 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as six symbol, although part of a married model since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If you go with him the shade areas of a reserved, discreet, committed, allergic starboards of the show-business, you will never be able to shine the mystery completely.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a blow to the heart for the cinemas, while his great characters popularize the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy cannot wish to focus his wife (Elizabeth Taylor) on the roof that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember this in the panics of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), who was disturbed by a marriage that did not keep as much promise.
So many other Paul Newman have gone through history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, guilty, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lassu someone loves me, of Robert Wise, a role for James Dean and recovered after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
That sympathic in the excellent Stingata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
The great film of Robert Rossen (1961), the color of Martin Scarse's money, which was valued in 1987 as the only oscar on 9 nominations.
What I saw over the years was his.
He's still here.
The times are going on through his path.
Young people especially know him for the cute Slap Shot-Colpo music of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, the leader of a little orthodox hockey team.
His sons found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role of the Irish mafia patriarch in Era my father in 2003.
Unlike the most lightest stages of the movie that left the show near the show, Newman will stay long in the halls, announcing Hollywood all his steps, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined it, with a point of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performances excessive.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like a man from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of marginalized young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholics, or desperate, of whom he expressed weakness and rebellion with his perfect treaties.
As a director, Newman discovered unknown moods of his true, dull sensitivity.
The first time Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with Joanne Woodward's wife in the role of the protagonist, was a subtle picture of melanconia.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdose, dedicated the 1984 Harry and Son film, a discreet and sad movie.
Among the countless hummingbirds on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old fellow of the army Robert Redford (who had been quoted together in La Stingata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, there is such a large warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestary of Hollywood origin.
We'd be surprised to see her looking on oil bottles, salts, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of cute, although born as a gag.
However, the income of those sales was for its Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, instead of focusing on his myth, he's trying to make it to the end.
He left his five children a letter that said "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly well-known to his good star.
Be it, it was a privilege."
And otherwise it was a privilege for us to follow the path of an American artist so clean and generous.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What has been produced in the factory of facts from Zuschlag & partners?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and others will be discussed.
The political man and his partners are accused of renegotiated commercial fraud in the context of a criminal association that has caused significant damage, and of other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Search for the money obtained from competition bands, it was used for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of activities through false facts.
The state and municipal money, totalling 65 million flowers, is partly in the Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the contracting authorities, they have taken the money received from competition bands on the basis of factors for non-existence operations and associations have never complied with their obligations.
According to the prosecutorial act, most of the facts were false.
In order to do so, the invoice blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the circular drums were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on whose name you intend to issue the invoices, it was established between the other during the match between the hills over the Balaton where Janos Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of this last one, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for a invoice for consumption, on the model of these then the invoices were prepared to be added to the competition bands, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Community of Budapest.
Many of these are works by István Lados and András Žori, who, according to our information, has made the necessary reports to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "study trip" was an office.
According to two facts issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, as the restaurant claims, would not all come together.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 at the Jobb Foundation, then called Egyyütt in Harmadik Üveveredér, a bottle of formal errors and content.
There are only three bedrooms in Badacsonytomy's pension, more than 10 people were unable to stay, but there were 130 guests in the invoice.
But the compilations of the full of fantasy factors have been exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., and this is also a restaurant, in which accountability - according to the information provided to the judicial authorities - did not even present the documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőret and Hoppa.
Győző Farkas, director of the company, said to hvg.hu that when he was summoned in search and showed him the facts, he immediately realized that it was false documents.
"Only the name and the Iva game of our company were found in a wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons, he did not even return to the fact that hundreds of people were accommodated, when there were all alone rooms and there are not so many beds.
To find out the fact was a restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in service for a while.
The invoice accompanying agents were not concerned about informing themselves that Budapest travel agency from their choice, only organises trips abroad, so they have kindly indicated the invoice with payment in county travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the fact was also about Iva, while travel to countries outside the European Union was about Iva.
Among other things, the amount of Iva was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Foundation Jobb Jövőert, in fact on the services offered by the company to apply Iva to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, the hotel employees also issued only printed invoices, while the invoice was written in hand.
In addition, the "emissions" have broken down other factors, in the case of one of them they indicated how the goods were transported on the road, as found in the Search procedure, which was not carried out by the company originally based on investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - due to non-conformity factor formation, false stamp - it has been found that invoices issued in favour of Együtt in Harmadik Üveredtér Alapitvány, of XXI. Szazadi Culturalis Egyesüet and Biztos Pont are false.
The same was true in the case of Ravenna Bt or the Confehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the facts.
The falsifiers have not even paid attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was liquidating when (2001) fed you a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, which is why the curator of the liquidation of the tooth, according to our information, refused to issue that fact to him.
They issued invoices knowingly.
Another group of invoice issuers is composed of those who were aware of the need to issue invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapest Alapítvány issued a bill on the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjj Socialistták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik  Éveveredtér of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the alleged act, urged Collab Kft's director to issue fetish facts.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and also partners the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices for a value of about 5 million flowers at the Jobb Jözéret Alapítvány Foundation, at the Atlasz Egyesüet Association and Vörösfenyő Egyesüet, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even money movement because the facts prepared were then stocked, but the associations forgot to make this look in their documents.
The following group of invoices shall belong to those who are related to the taxpayers.
Ad. Ivan Kubatov, authorized to recapture the Director General of Delta Trió Kft, who is located in Budapest but is not recoverable there, who is engaged in fuel and car trade.
It released several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer media for a value of about 18 million florins.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas has purchased these invoices since September 14, 2005.
The director-general of this department was a Romanian who, between 2002 and 2005, Ivan Kubatov would have omitted the documents on it.
As we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had released facts on behalf of the company at Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Üveveredtre Alapitvány and the opponent was taken by him.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian walls founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, however, none of these were operational, because according to the tax they had not received work.
The companies, however, made it useful because at the request of the lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's foundation documents, on behalf of the firms, invoices were issued to associations related to Zuschlag: at Atlasz and Y-Generáção.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov released to several 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The investigation considers that Kubatov has increased 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as on the Iva.
The man has also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional facts, manufactured by Bzitos Pont’s competitive band.
Y-Generation and Society in Modern Hungary in January 2006 presented a band for the Socialist Party's public utility agency, TMA.
They also won 500,000 head flowers but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to the TMA five fictional facts received from the Works Team Kft.
These facts were found during the investigation of the office of Árpád Kemexei at the Ministry of Public Education.
Some of the employees, as they have already done in their search, will probably refer to the increase in the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the tax number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to raise the view over everything.
His confession has not yet been very detailed, and even if he has promised to speak in an extended manner more often, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see if it is in his interest, it may also seem that socialists have taken the agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a resurgence of 50 million flowers, much of the damage - would be willing to make the expatriate cap.
Zuschlag could for now also be offended because his requests for relief from his prison conditions, namely the granting of domestic arrests, have not been granted until now.
While not resuscitating and causing much greater damage, commercial operators can freely travel or at least wait at home for the end of the procedure against them, which is not granted to them.
The psychology of biding in excess: why spend more money?
The buyers are willing to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic basiss of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study on Science magazine, men don't want to stay back in a race like eBay, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
Research has tried to trace the nervous system of this "part" at the level of the nervous system through experimental acids.
A group of volunteers played the game, the other group of players participated in a show while with the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the play of the donkey, in which the essential element is to bid more than the other, the body stranded under the cerebral cortex comes in intensively into operation when the game is lost.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "autogratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
So according to researchers, the price rise is explained by scanting the frequent reaction of the stranded body.
In support of their theory, the research group's economists carried out a financial investigation.
In this investigation three groups have offered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group referred to the actual value of the product concerned and made their comments.
In addition to this, another group promised that in the event of a win, they would receive another $15 prize.
The third group, however, would have received 15 dollars before the strike, but the members of the group would have lost the money in case of damage to the strike.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the victory was underlined, while for the other the loss was lost.
By checking the hypotheses of neurologists members of the group who played "against loss" they were willing to make higher points than the control group or "winners".
"These results are not deduced from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These facts have so far explained the responsible phenomena to the axles with the joy of winning and the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have reached a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York Economy.
Hepatitis: when to talk to your doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary, but among the first causes of death are chronic hepatitis.
In Hungary the number of patients with hepatitis amounts to 100, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and hepatitis, but their pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis virus spreads in two main forms according to the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (semi, vaginal loss, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to vaccinating against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two weeks after the use of infected foods accompanied by general disorders, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After they form yellow maces on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the fibers become clear and the dark urine, the healing occurs within two and a half weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of disease, which causes liver tumors and liver surgeons.
The main reason is, according to the estimates, that only one person in ten receives a pharmacologic treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if you are not treated, it may cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogen agents destroy the liver cells subdoally, in many cases the first symptoms occur after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: who had a blood transfusion before 1991, toxic-dependent patients and tattoos.
In the world today the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease, it is appropriate to talk to a family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Acknowledging in time the disease is treatable, the virus can be eliminated by the organism, thus losing the infectious power and can prevent the formation of tumors.
September 30th is the World Day of the Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by disease associations.
The aim is to draw attention to the viral chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the outcome of a recent investigation, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic which has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The scientists at Oxford University have performed an interesting experience, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, has communicated with the British Telegraph.
In the context of the investigation, an electroshock was made to 12 Catholic believers and to other atheists, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
On the basis of the results, Catholic believers were able to overcome much of the pain.
Thanks to the experimental technique of the human brain, it was found that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The test is the first of a series of research that includes scientists, philosophers and theology of the University in addition to academics.
The test was performed exactly like this: a tool that emits discharges and passes the electroshock has been connected to the left hand of the test subject.
The researchers asked participants to concentrate on two drawings, the virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Dama with the Hermlin of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of Virgin Mary would produce a sort of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo's frame was chosen because he did not differ too much from the other and considered it a comforting effect.
The subjects of the experiment passed half an hour before the MRI scanner and in this time period they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while they either observed or painted on religious or other subjects.
The Catholics referred to the vision of the Virgin Mary to make them feel "safe" as if "some took care of them" and "they were comforted and persecuted by peace".
Looking at the image on religious issues, they took into account 12% less pain than they had before in Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Fararias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect even for the atheists, but it is necessary to find the appropriate image.
"We must look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright was accompanied by the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a lady of Leonardo or another painter of such calibre is presented to the believers, what effect might it have on the control of the pain?
Would the vision of a virgin Mary of quality bring better results?
I know what you're saying about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday Google can claim to be both in the pockets of people and in the sky above their heads; he knows where the holidays have passed, which ambulances frequent and what interests them.
This, however, says Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the diet, is not enough yet.
However, as far as the sceptics make a comparison with the Orwellian Incuba, they do not see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that the main purpose of Google is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to reach the original goal of Google founders who were: "we enter into a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's director, after 10 years of revolutionary work, he is still able to manage all the information.
The question what will happen between five years Schmidt replied: would you like Google to answer questions like "What am I doing tomorrow?" or "What would the job be suitable for me?" but the software can't answer questions apparently simply because they don't know enough of the users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their online search the exact words are recorded, from which IP address are searched, and on which page the interested parties are stopped after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago, users like e.g. can remember their browsing history, they can look at what they have looked for and clicked, and then long ago they will generate results on a much better scale; on this same logic it is based on Recommendations that the system offers us products and services based on our stated and registered preferences.
What happens if my data are used against me, if they see what I'm dealing with? - people are asked about Google data monopolies.
In most cases internal conflicts are caused by the spousal evidence of the size of the potential power represented by the tooth, and not by the sense of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire of freedom or access to the power of rebellion.
One fact is confirmed, however, and that all the expressions sought are not only recorded, but in motivated cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases there is no defence of the personal rights of the interns.
The most striking example of this in recent times is perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google has denied the Brazilian government the information that has made it possible to identify pedophiles from the website of the community Orkut maintained by Google.
Interns concerned with personal rights, however, have dreamed of silence by May when the law - in agreement with the EFF legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: neither can Google be bound by any constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully defeated almost 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions obtained in relation to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but it has failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords for two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore somewhat contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are moving Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use services and raise themselves with the rebellious rebellion against the multinationals who spy on the conservative image.
In the meantime, the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users shared in many countries see in them the future generation of big teeth, the "cool corporation" opposite their rivals, Microsoft liquidated as the world conqueror because of Windows, because both fight for the same purpose.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up-to-date and the software package is much more accessible, young and cool of official software placement practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which involves just one of the key words most frequently repeated in recent years, web 2.0.
The 2.0 website speaks of nothing but collaboration, to leave intensive traces behind us and to use the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles on more community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can collect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists their musical tastes, all of them can insert them into systems such as FriendFed or Blip.fm, you can also write blogs about which their latest photo gallerys are automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa.
However, we read of many examples that make it clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, comes easily to know who spent the night her loyal boy or a tooth can license her dependant because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now is completely taken into account.
Those who live a life on-line are able to show themselves and thus we can form the basic theme that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopolies can do it (e.g. starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but who at the same time doesn't voluntarily leave track).
There are few people who do not register about community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from the development of text to image management and the collection of news, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not related to large parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
Public opinion does not wait so much in secret when Google will throw the articles out.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars of value is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the advertising spaces AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, the services introduced at record time cause great damage not only to Microsoft but also to many software development firms.
However, critical observers agree with everything they find alarming points: the company summit, for example, has completely rejected the employee's protest after having doubled the company's asset's right, has considered it too expensive the repeated restaurant to enjoy the employees' daily pleasure, but this also decreases in the fact that in 2006 Google has China's head to the Chinese government and under their agreement it will filter all the results that undermines the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of this decree seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it will be useful, one thing is sure, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will disappear from the world at one point: while some think that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines will take proportions that will soon be found in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others have fear of the Health system, which in this way we can create our health profile with our references, medical and problems.
Since Google is building a genetic basis, it can offer good materials to the next generation of fantasy writers, the famous Cory Doctorow Scroogled account describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google's data can be approached alarmingly.
Two minors helped Ózd's double murder to spread the tracks
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected of having helped to spread the traces of crime - said the police spokesman of the Borsod region on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the fact that they have been accused of being wrong, and are currently accused of being wrong.
The two minors, two girls according to the information provided by the ILO, defend themselves on a free foot.
The benefit shall be payable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man of the place, was held in preventive detention on Sunday.
It's suspected of premedicated multipleicides committed for the sake of profit.
The investigation led to the young Ventitrene having a big debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, so on Wednesday last night, he caught his creditor in a corner of Ózd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to ICT information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a sign is that he committed murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapons and circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Borsa di Warsaw has made an offer for the purchase of the Borsa di Praga
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion black crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Borsa, confirmed the offer made by the Polishs despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Borsa as potential buyer of the Borsa di Prague.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that Warsaw's Borsa is owned by the state.
The 99% of the shares are in hand with the Polish state, which intends to sell in the course of a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial journal E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest ever advanced figure for the Borsa di Prague.
According to the Czech press so far, they have presented an offer to the Bosa of Vienna, the Trans-Atlantic Bors Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the Borsa of London and the German Borsa.
Petr Koblic, director of Prague's values Borsa, said last week that the Borsa of Warsaw would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the close of the Borsa of Prague in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Borsa di Prague in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Borsa di Prague is the Patria Finance with a rate of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spóřitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European journals
The main European journals in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis are already talking about 'second 11 September'.
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the President of the United States - he accuses La Repubblica - that he has not been able to accompany his party behind a rapidly broken law, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire superfinanceer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second 11 September.
A part of Madrid's print is also seen in Washington the spying capital.
According to El World, the lack of US political leadership has led to the global economy on the edge of the barrier.
It will increase the risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system and will then suffer worldwide.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the vote of the Congress, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for crisis management.
The global economy is suspended in air, just as the history of capitalism is being transformed.
It is no longer possible to transmit the threat - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva accelerates.
Some states today can still offer a savings package to the shipping financial institutions and with the money of contributors can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks break as into a dominant effect then they will not be sufficient neither the financial means nor new solutions.
In the long term, Member States of the European Union must overcome their national selfishness and concentrate on controlling the financial markets in the Member States.
Only on Monday did the weak financial institutions get more than 100 billion euros - remember the Vienna Der Standard, which seems to be more realistic than European contributors, like the Americans, will have to hand their portfolio to alleviate the crisis.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvations" should not immediately cover EUR 100 billion, although it would be better if they established where the contributors' money should be used to prevent major damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the flight of the calabron
What could be the best way to develop anti-collition technologies if you don't imitate the senses of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, those of the Api.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the first strategic insight to the Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collition systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biochemical robot, a robotic mini-bot providing api's properties, with the ultimate aim of creating a system capable of scanning all collections.
With the wings formed an oval personal space that is really very similar to our protective shield - he explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR and research and development technology sector.
Important is the role of the eye view, capable of a visual of 300 degrees per direction.
Engineers have drawn attention to the idea of telemetric laser to copy the function of the app's view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two meters of distance within a 180 degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second, the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the wings, changes immediately by turning the routes of the measure necessary to prevent the incident.
This manoeuvre of prevention, unlike the current system, is done in a manner that is quite authentic.
"If it wasn't so, the robot car wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
This technology must respond in an exact and immediate way because it corresponds to the most damaging and internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes an apple to avoid other apples.
This process must take place in an eye battery.
But unlike the apia, the deviation cannot go to the height or bottom or diagonal, it can be only bidimensional and in the direction of the sterility of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to scan the other wings, the robot, as the opportunity available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow.
The BR23C is fed by batteries to litio polymers, lighter and high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, it is important to be aware of the intelligence reaction, not the processing of data, or even less the ability to store them.
This robot must produce some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to remember them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvre data, thus using only a few decades of Kb memory.
There is no need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of colleges that, provided for in Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Another possibility of application may be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that prevents the obstacles on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name of the precious child
The written version of the Economic Savings Act was revised at $700 billion for the purchase of disproportionate loans, to be applied in most parts.
In the first pass, half of the sum is spent.
In the new treaty until midnight, according to the time of the East Coast, the convention leaders decided to save from $700 billion after a debate that lasted for days - referred to Reuters.
We have taken a series of steps forward - Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American Chamber of Representatives, said that he has just left the deal on the letter.
Both the presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Minister of the Treasurer Henry Paulson spoke about the outcome of the compromise: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi, it is not about the saving of Wall Street but about the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 p.m. in Washington (the 2nd night of Monday according to the Central European time), but did not produce a large increase in the buses.
On Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will vote first on the proposed economic stability law of 2008 concerning the programme, after which it will reach the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, then welcomed the news of the agreement at the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress made this evening and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - Tony Fratto said he was bringing home from the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that $700 billion would have been spent all for the purchase of securities with disproportionate loans on the back.
As a first step, you will be able to spend at least half of the sum of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of the Congress, with which the Ministry of the Interior will buy titles with non-proportional credits, of the remaining $100 billion will decide by the President.
A special colleague will control the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve is also taking part.
The cost of the next half of 700 billion is dependent on a new decree of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of the Interior can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time credit, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "advanced".
The purchase can happen through this and directly – they have announced the ministry’s competences.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested parties to take part in an insurance scheme where the Ministry of the Interior guarantees the means to care for which companies will pay an appropriate price for the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the necessary means so that 700 billion dollars will arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which is about the purchase of incorrect financial means, or their insurance or to prevent the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to find us ready to introduce the law just signed - it has added.
Bank managers in crisis and waiting for state aid think that the government will limit their well-being, defined by the oil slang just as a golden parachute.
The limitations of payments will only occur in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of the Interior will provide assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an asterisk, it will impose a fine on the gold parachute, if they do not hire the decoded bank manager.
At the time of the purchase of non-proportional credits, the government will intervene aggressively in order to ensure that the money of the directors is not excessive.
This adds that the existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for the new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the U.S. history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of the general administrators - he commented on the provision made by the democratic Barney Frank Chairman of the Commission responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, it has the right to adapt to a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of contributors, since they can, in the end, also benefit us if the economy, together with the saved bank, is to continue.
The proposal for a law includes that in the next five years, the President must submit to the Congress a proposal on how to restore the planned losses from the financial sector to the contributors.
Of course, both sides were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us not to defend the contributors' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the crowd of Wall Street.

The next year in the United States?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that by January 12th, the US-Hungarian visa exemption agreement could enter into force - the Foreign Minister has spoken about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that but ultraocean is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
However, he called attention to the fact that in the new system we will no longer have access to access, but the tourists will have to register before departure.
The responsibility of Hungarian diplomats will continue to apply to the treaties in Washington today.
You will meet with the Minister of the Foreign Condolences Rice, who will deliver the medal of the Cross of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will invite the foreign policy consultants of the democratic candidate Barack Obama and the republican John McCain.
Also Barack Obama and John McCain hid in favour of the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates to the presidency of the two major American parties, have guaranteed their support on Sunday at the government level of $700 billion for bank rescue, but there are politicians who claim the resignation of the Minister of the Treasury.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration after the Marathon negotiations continued for days, on Sunday evenings announced that they had concluded a principle agreement on the Bank's rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys with the first stage of economic issues Obama has again gained some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of the vice-president of Sarah Palin, was disbanded.
Obama, in a speech in Detroit, expressed the hope that the convention would quickly approve the law on the plane of $700 billion.
He stressed that the proposal contains these consumer protection steps that have been supported by him.
"Now we must act responsiblely (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, the full economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
McCain's economic ideas are not allowed to go beyond definition.
McCain, in an interview with the ABC, explained that "all of us are going to be able to handle this situation with difficulties (...) but doing nothing is a road."
The rapporteur said that the proposal included the creation of a control committee for the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of top managers, which he had to insist on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the Minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Print version of the German-language world
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole of the electors have become more familiar - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Hayder's party is ready to rule Austria in order to prevent the red-nera coalition.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The revolution of Bavaria robs its parents of the causes of CSU's squat drama.
According to the well-known politician, CSU's erosion has already begun long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber went into custody.
The Christian-socials have remodeled the Bavarian for decades, and right now these modern citizens leave them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Mercer.
The sconfitta was not a great surprise for the CSU, but it was finished a process that exactly ten years ago had been realized: the inconsistency of a party-state is over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was estimated at 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago to the Bundestag elections in 2005 in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
This is the reason why modernization is carried out in a way that destroys parents in the region.
Sociologists have predicted it 40 years ago, but they have failed a lot of time. However, secularization, the results of education, the installation of East and North Germans in the bavarese developed region could not remain without consequences for the integrity of the electors to the CSU.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters become more aware, critical, hosted.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the CSU has attracted the classic bourgeois groups: free professionals, artists, diplomats and laureates.
This is where CSU support has been made under 40%.
The printing (depresse.com)
The daily conservator came "Who with whom?" In the article "The presidents of the parties are blocked in the issues of co-alition" he is dealing with the confusion of Austrian internal political situation created after the elections.
The SPÖ intends to deal with the SVP.
ÜVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ shows open to treaties in all directions, the Greens still don't want to discuss co-operation.
The elections were made, and now all around the coalition; in the public TV discussion, the party's leaders have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to deal with the ÜVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open as to whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the ÜVP, as vice-president.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molter race was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction shall not be considered.
Molterer has reacted cautiously to all the red bids.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
If his party chooses the opposition or enter into the coalition is still an open matter in the party, the issues will be discussed in any case within the ØVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeatedly been open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-nery coalition we are ready to assume the responsibility of the government" - Haider said.
Járóka: The vision of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris, the European Summit for the Couples has been launched, organised this year by France with the presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party, Fidesz, in a message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the Congress called attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that afflicts Roma children and to achieve the most serious obstacle to their claim.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among the conference invitations were governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil organisations and the defence of rights in the context of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Parliamentary Group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the allegations, that Roma are expelled from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have a medium-level study title and as a result of elementary quality teaching, only a number of them can achieve a higher study title".
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in estimating human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the delegation, it is necessary to make these connections widely known between Roma and non Roma.
In fact, the first time the school starts a rom, it increases its potential to become a productive member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes, it contributes to the budget of the nation.
"The right to European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and secret schools" - Lívia Járóka stressed.
According to the Member State, the European Union's objective and action is needed to speed up the disintegration of schools, and that is why it is essential that the right to respect existing anti-discrimination directives is respected.
"The vision of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, and Roma children need to be given the opportunities granted from the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens of the future of Europe" - Járóka asked.
Under the "European Year of the Paris Opportunity" to ensure for all, the purpose of the European Summit for the Couples organised each year from the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and to set up opportunities at the national and European level.
CSU: patent for a transitional period
At the end of October, you will decide on the fate of the infected couple Huber-Beckstein.
Although the gross electoral sconference has not yet been broken, the KSU Bavarese summits have been referred to as the time when personal issues were discussed.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in his seat, the question is as long as the painting lasts.
Of the fate of Tandem which has immediately lost 17% of votes will decide the party's extraordinary convention in the final week of October.
The two very criticised politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not attacked by all forces at the seat.
They have thus tried to destroy the angry writings of the parliamentary group and of the basis that one day after the "bavarese tsunamis" claimed the personal consequences of the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the end of his career, the Christian-social union received 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber, it fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been an "absolute monarch" in Bavaria that gives 18% of the German GDP.
Although conservationists in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, in the future they will be forced to coalify themselves.
What is the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of the Horst Seahofer Agriculture, who is considered to be the leader of Huber, takes a position in the restricted exploratory group that will initiate treaties with the liberals of the FDP and the electors of the Free Elections for a possible government coalition in Monaco in Bavaria.
For a strange drawing of the fate on the list of the Liberal electors, Gabriele Pauli's attitude against Stoiber was used as an opportunity to strike by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
CSU's leaders now concentrate on all their efforts to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, which has so far been in the shadow. The former regional and former President of the CSU has defined the day of his political career on 28 September.
On Monday Huber released some statements to the CSU, according to which they would deserve greater support from the brother's party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel cannot be cancelled after the elections of the Bundestag established in September 2009 unless the CSU has been sent on foot with common forces, which has played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory.
According to Merkel, which does not hide deluxe for failure, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
This is certainly true: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, but the social democratic crisis is still difficult.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability in the country guided by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained by the booklets made in the context of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 million people in a country is free of opposition for more than a decade, prior to yesterday's elections, the opposition gathered under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped that Lukashenko, with the renewed presidential mandate for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections in the circumstances in which it was discussed, "conceeded" some sitting in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus abandoned a previously assessed booking.
According to the opposition's expectations, Belarus, more and more economically dependent on Russia, which has requested a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas increasingly expensive and has agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines across the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter into the anti-democratic political situation.
It referred to a distance that the OSCE in assessing the electoral campaign placed emphasis on positive movements and not on the shortcomings, such as the prohibition to present themselves for a third of the candidates of the opposition.
The OSCE's rapid report on Monday, however, also criticised the campaign, during which the applicants of the opposition in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the polls.
Despite this opposition, it is understandable that an improvement in the political climate is possible: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also ready for a small comparison with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state letter, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - has declared our daily Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election, it is unlikely that "the power had been afraid to enter a single opposition in a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide for protest actions for the results, but rather tries to bring the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the days of opposition in Russia, for the distribution of local authorities were having difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly, Millinkeovich said, referring to the fact that even the most officially assisted ceto, the pensioners, is considered appropriate to the Lukashenko regime, which considers its main result to create social security.
Due to the neglect of the country and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a matter of time for social security disintegration "which recalls sepolcral silence" - considers Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition's policy, the Russian observers have condemned democratic elections.
Sergej Lebedev, President of the Independent State Community, told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in fact," so the lack of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never been successful in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were generous ports for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is taking place against the dust, against those who smoke and then drink a cup of coffee at the bar in working hours.
The novelty of antifanullons has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The gates - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," said the minister.
"Now a new stage of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is reformism," Brunetta still points out.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of railway ports is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no resistance from employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was cooperation between all."
In short, no more meals in working hours; nothing more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
In the course of a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the absences for public employees' disease were reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand people in more than one year's work".
And add that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "his salary dynamics - explains the Minister - in the past 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates."
As many as thousands of public employees are united to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by resorting to the application supported by the Codecons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is failing today, there are still numbers about the least absenteeism in work due to disease - writes the association of consumers - the people of the 'opportunity' are growing.
In fact, in Italy, there are thousands of right and productive public employees who are united to declare war against the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, Tar will be opposed to the exclusion of additional economic treatment for disease-related diseases; the extension of the hours of reperability of the sick worker, including the visits to the inspection, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister's mandate.
Labour incidents, Napolitan: "Crescent Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 incidents occur, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail's data confirm that the white dead were about 1,200.
Numbers that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and cause almost twice the deaths compared with the murders.
In order to draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, Anmil now celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Labour, institutionalized in the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the same chronic tragedies of these days confirm how crucial it is to prevent work," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Inalienable Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "live appreciation for the continuing associated effort in order to prevent workplaces, the protection of informed workers, the assistance of victims' families and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, there has been an angry 'bout', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedy, which, for their size, provokes the clarivor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality calls for dramatic, even repeatable cases in their dynamics."
Napolitan does not realize that "there is no doubt also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In part, many initiatives promoted in the school field take place for a more direct awareness taken by young people who are facing the world of work.
It is important to pay attention to the phenomenon, not to dwell in the alarm of its social severity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
From his point of view, the President of the Gianfranco fini stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which undermines the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment towards urgently ending pigs".
"The data on labour accidents seem to indicate a slight positive move, but this does not remove the number of white deaths as impressive as it is," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this "severe tendency" to be translated into less attention, because it is right when attention is trained to explode tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level it is still too little to counter the phenomenon of infoturns and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
We need more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this comes from the school's world."
"It is a further effort - it has added - to the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But, above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility by employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of pension protection envisaged for the victims of work" and the "advancedness to which the system is sensitizing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the sort of person who is involved should not depend on spontaneousism or sometimes enlargement provided by the legislator."
Mp3 readers under the charge, risk the hearing
Listening to high volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is how the European Commission, in a communication published in Brussels, refers to the scientific committee's opinion on emerging and recently identified health risks (Csseri) published today.
"From this scientific opinion - we read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than one hour a day with high volume device risking permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who often use portable music devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly harm their hearing in irreparable ways," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific discoveries - continue the responsibility of Ue - emerges a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
More importantly, we need to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We must also examine existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to make them fully effective and take the step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - which concludes the Ue executive - confirm that there is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now consider with the Member States and interested parties what measures they can possibly take to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and fine equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits 100 dB to the level of noise of portable musical equipment, but concerns about hearing damage may arise from an excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit many of these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue indicates that users of portable music equipment are listening to high volume (over 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits on maximum noise permitted at work.
Those who listen to music under these conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would involve 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number could be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany leads the Commission to the future of capital
Today it begins, in March, it closes, in June, the sums will be dropped.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Committee for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning in its new headquarters behind the terms of Caracala.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other Commission components will point to the guidelines for Rome.
Once the combatants are closed in March, the Günta and the Common Council will evaluate and evaluate projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ballot" of the Campidoglio and its German union Gianni.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas - it has to be underlined by Germany - it will have to provide proposals for an idea for the development of Rome by which political decision-makers, who remain in the Community and the Council, can then proceed.
There is no superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will wake up, because this experience must have a time-limit.
In June - announce the union - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany reiterates: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, both in France and in France with the Attal Commission and as safe as in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
It is too often a matter of day-to-day management and of the emergencies that once again occur.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and longer, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Roma union has to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a car: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to justify and involve the best intelligence that the capital expresses."
For Germany, in fact, "there must be a strategic, non-closed and real reference design to allow our city to make a genuine level jump, which it has made absolutely necessary, thinking with a united spirit in its future."
A future that, according to Rome's union, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will save much more" not only in the Baltic of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first president of the United States.
He wrote an American political note that has to pass on to us as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, took the US economy and had reports (as it does today from a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
They increase attacks against Obama just as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great deal of pride: he believes he will win the highest rank of a nation that has had both rulers and five black senators!".
In fact, there are attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racist attacks and they don't answer the electoral question: will he be a good president? Still there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good discretion.
Even in this case there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A daily from Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It goes out one side of the American mind held up to the last.
"Tell you what you want, then we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'll leave America.
Something you've never said before, which seems almost certain of the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasons, however, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? The 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to dig in the tent.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the valuations.
Nevertheless, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Use, the economic trachele also feels about journalists: in the journals it's time to cut. And many blame the Internet, "killer" of the printed letter.
Five hundred American journalists were interpolated by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control over the future.
Well, today's journalists are almost all cruel about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destructive economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the journals together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that will be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the public understands it, to be substantially replaced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today by the American journalist.
You are on 10 newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the daily at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against Broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a boat to the internet, for many views such as the "skiller" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are using technology in the hope that "it does something good" for their journalism.
The biggest space in American journalism today is among those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national executives are sure their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage decreases to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "working security."
Executives who think of losing their job in 3 years are 47% at national level.
For reporters, it's going to 30%.
The "secure work" at staff level (our editors, etc) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a vast nation like the Usai, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet workers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
The directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can also earn $10 thousand a month, as well as pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reason is complicated: every day after the first year, every day after the third to arrive at 15 days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, for their admission, often "implant" during the year.
It's all climate issue.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, DANILO COPULA RISTA GROTTAFRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Roman court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to cancel the residence of the real estate worker Danilo Coppola who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in the city of Rome.
Coppola is ingested by a banknote under the investigation of the dispute relating to the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the process, the last week, he obtained the discharge from the households converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the realist might walk through the road from the province's town to a housing in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (which he considered contrary to the PM) would have the effect of influencing his company and access to the evidence they accuse him of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon was already shown a few days ago by the vote of the Chamber of Representatives against the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars from the White House: a significant part of Americans were, and it is, more interested in paying Wall Street than in saving the economy.
It confirms the New York Times yesterday, informing us that the current crisis is spreading the Republican Party, more and more divided between its old animal East Coast, moderately favourable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, host to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the point, which has been made quite alive by the vote I mentioned at the outset.
However, this is just one example of the changes, of major changes, which the current economic climate may predict or already let go: not only in the United States but in all the West and perhaps even here.
Both in Usa and in Europe the crisis seems to work from accelerator of phenomena incineration from time to time which in the new climate are solidified and finally brought to light.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relaunch, of the double category of State-Sovereignity in relation to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is the crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, yes, ties with the outside, but that are primarily involved in the broad scale of the balance of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: and that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, inter alia, are also elected.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of play or has little to say: the lamp test is given by the European Union that divides as usual between various interests and between the various state strategies cannot decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of each individual State that all expect intervention, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and especially fund-raising: since when it comes to strike, only the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources can try to relocate things into sex.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use: two resources of unlimited value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organization can ever have the same size.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-national element is of the remaining in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the latest developments in the economy tend to attach to a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now going into the government of the network, of sophisticated technology, of materials, and we were convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized from a treaty that our future should rather make up for growing accounts with those very little material things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look at a little, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth, but they are also linked in an absolute way to a circled space, to a territory.
So that whoever is found to be superior, he certainly has a lot of cards more than he is, to whom he does not, to whom he strives to live in a place without collections, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second news, but it's a mess.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for volunteer leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, there is a lack of discrepancy for existing leadership, economic species, so revealed and filled with shadow areas.
And together something more profound and in some disturbing sense: a discrepancy, an insatiableness, an image of inequality, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class of leaders in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems that this is becoming more and more roads, in large sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of social elites up to now, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, having done their time and being ever more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The request for leadership, in summarily, provides a ramparted but powerful movement of delegation of the leading classes and of traditional political assets, which is shown in the electoral “revolts” or in the recent events of the collective immunities of these last and last days, from the conservatory in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the labor consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rhythms, their journals, their intellectual accreditations, their format would make it more difficult to understand, and thus to represent, what is not taking place in the deep streets of Western societies today and that the economic crisis is growing, potentially depleted.
In the face of all of this, talking about a "rebellion of masses" at the end of the day would be openly exaggerated.
But keeping the eyes clearly open is certainly not for anything.
The supercolle to walk on the walls
Secrecy the laws of gravity through a super hill and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the objective of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close.
The students were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall with an adhesion of just 2.5 cm square feet.
LO STUDIO – American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the studio team is an evolution of those who use a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubs.
"The origin of the hill can be imagined as a series of tubes systemed as a spaghetti pill," explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the teeth of the geese, covered by microscopic skin that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests performed on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adaptor is ten times more powerful than these rectangles and at the same time, it's easy to get out of the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
CAMINARE SUI MURI? - "This material could be useful as a transitional recipe" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use than the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubs are heat and electrical current drivers.
Other applications may refer to aerospace engineering.
For now, I have no superiors.
The ALTRA RICERCA – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new beneficiary.
In an article on the American Chemical Society magazine, California students presented an adjunct form of microfibre as hair that are self-pulsed by dust during the movement on a surface to maintain perfect adherence.
Pharmacotherapeutic group: never with fruit juice
Attention to the juice of apples, the oil and honey.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summers because they are dissipating and rich in vitamins, if they are administered concomitantly to some healthy medicines, they change absorption by amplifying or reducing them depending on the case with serious health consequences.
Reconfirming the risks of fruit juices, it is provided that freshs associated with the use of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th American Chemical Society's national meeting in Philadelphia launch a new alarm: just a bottle of powder, rice and honey to reduce the absorption of some healthy medicines, cancel the benefits and endanger the health of patients.
The powder juice was already finished under the charge because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, anthropic, antihistamines and neurological medicinal products.
PHARMACACI A RISCHIO - The same Italian Medicine Agency had reported in a leaflet two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the risk of this mix and to give attention to what you are drinking in the case of medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT only POMPELMO - Experts also suggest that orange juice and honey contain substances that inhibit the drugs.
Along the list of active principles derived from powder and other sugars.
From here the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"These findings are generally reported immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that are likely to change the information notes of the pharmaceuticals.
So always read the illustrated pages of the medicines you are taking and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not impress us but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarifications" stressed the expert at the Ansa agency.
The Nobel of the Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to the American Paul Kruggman for his studies on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Neokinesian who teaches at Princeton University and is an editorialist in New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical of the external economic and political choices of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, in the days when Enron failed, Kruggman had planned in a paper published on New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that is not a bit Polish and that has been addressed to the economist for years, but that has now become clear.
"I'm surprised and also somewhat shocked about the speed with which the memory of scandals like the Enron or Worldcom collapsing has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a disclaimer with a very aggressive style, especially critical against excessive freedoms of Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, in which SUN Microsystem monitors SUN, the new Open Office is shown to the large audience with different news: on the screen of welcome and less open-ended interface, if they add more substantial than the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as what allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via e-mail, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphical design module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Ibrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text manufacturer.
Cooperation is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, more and more users can be involved, avoiding conflicts over changes in the text laboratory, each participant is assigned a color in comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functionality on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks they should deliver the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/Download/3.0.0/Download300.html and is added to the English that was on Friday's mirror.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent at home or at work on request.
And if the topic of freedom can be a training for the dissemination of houses, it is right in the business field that Open Office then tries the big score, and can already count on various projects already carried out in public administration and schools.
And they don't even lack the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the Word corresponding video script; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's fine presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the database; Draw, it is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to get to 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Even Kohl's positive result is the fourth case of doping
New case of positive in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, the third-classed and winner of the best-scaling sword.
To report the news is the website of the daily team.
The 26th Kohl is the fourth positive corridor to the Cera, the third generation's Age, after the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Scumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl's blood samples takes place between those performed in the last few weeks by the laboratories in Losanna and Chatenay-Maabry.
If the controls confirm the positive in Cera, Austria will lose its third place at the Tour and will meet two years of canonic squallification.
To confirm Kohl's positive news at the Age of the Third Generation is the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26th Austrian was placed on the final podium on the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also adding the clay to be the best scaling.
MIGRATED: NEW YORK TIMES AND CHIEDE, ITALY IS RAZIST?
Italy "from the country of immigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with a return.
This is transforming the Belpaese into a nation of racists? Is it how much you ask in a long article the New York Times that has dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "paradosso of the north": the northern regions are at the same time where it registers "more integration and more work" but also the "higher anti-immigrants feeling of the country and the highest support to the North Law".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation intended by the Law that binds the immigration barriers and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine prisoners is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The emphasis is underlined both by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedetto XVI at Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to confiscate racism."
High-cost car rental students up to 900 euros per room
The price market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the residents' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon is now very serious at the point of exclusion from the right of young people from the study for the top comprehensive costs that families of origin should support - explains the responsibility of the Sonia study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so fragmented the market to introduce a process of generalised growth for residents."
In the majority of cases, tenders include a series of infringements: free-of-charge contracts, not registered, free-of-charges, under-charges.
There is a need for special intervention for the Union that, through the revision of tax taxation, prices can be reduced.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, about 450 euros are happening; for a single room is a minimum of 650 (Black Bande) to an average of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence an average bed area of EUR 350/400, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrated in the areas near the University, they spent 250/280 euros per bed in a double bed, from 370 to 500 per single.
In Rome in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 per bed in a double room.
Lower prices are only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas near the other universities (Ostiennes and Chinese).
It was saved only if it moved to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 one single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed, 300/450 euros were spent, from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed, there were 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rent to extra-Community students, such as Perugia, is more frequent, an additional anomaly is recorded: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested by foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Old Addio cinema Paradise, cities cancel historical halls
Historical cinematographic rooms are closed in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms is a hidden city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore takes an effective picture of what is happening in the great Italian cities but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalizing cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the great multisalals and the resulting death to conconciliation of monosals in the central areas of the city, is one of those events that we find inevitable and undisputable but also has all the features of a true and own cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and memory loads, "it's as if there were less a friend, a familiar one with whom we shared a piece of street and so many emotions," observes the director of New Film Paradise, the film that spent twenty years in Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Cannes's Grand Prize of Juice, and that recorded the poetry of a province hall and the nostalgia for a way to live the movie that might have been lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of the emperors, are clear: in the last five years, the 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and to pay the higher score are mainly the rooms in the main cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 persi monosala cinema, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsibility for their disappearance is the occurrence of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisalam cinemas: 195 screens in more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exercise has been radically developed," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but should ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its participants are willing to move to multiplex.
In order not to speak of the lack of funding for the fund in favour of the taxpayers: the State's advance debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shame, from a ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, they would serve between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million a year.’
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, has decided to proceed with the signature of a protocol between the Commune and Anec, the first of which is in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical and in the peripheral.
Among the standards provided for are tax facilitation measures for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: viewers will be allowed to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special tariffs for support and some parking.
"It's an initiative I like," observed Josephe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by taking other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter the strapothe of the multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Supercinam of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the stencil that convinced me to do "New Paradise movie", which I had thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I move forward to the Rialto or the Quirinale via the Nationale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the folders attached to the dust I turn around from the other side.”
Links between politics and the arrest of soldiers of Joia Tauro
"The union of Joia Tauro was available to form the Community's elections to the interests of the Piromalli cosca".
The charges against the judges of the Anti-Calabria Anti-Calabria Directorate are heavy against the union and vice-president of Gioia Tauro Giorgio from Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the union of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested for external competition in a massive association.
In the Manettes too, Joaacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer, homonymous of the boss, has already been sentenced to association for the crime of mafia printing, sentenced to 10 million euros.
"In spite of any legal and moral standards, as well as the good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations expressed their desire to pay advice to the lawyer Piromelli.
"It would have been thus granted to the county - they wrote the judges - to enter officially within the municipalities by facilitating the possibilities, already urgent, control and address of public administration."
The president of the Calabrese regional jury Agazizio Loiero does not hide that "colosions between local and organised malavits are different" in his region: "There are areas where the mafiosian intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the dragongheat, people who keep themselves clean."
The arrests of the prisoners follow those of the last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromelli castle.
By the end of April, the joint council of Joia Tauro had been dismissed but already in 1991, and in spite of alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been charged with administering the Community.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, a union of Udc at the time of graduation, was elected head of a central coalition, after the vote in May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the expulsion of the municipal council.
He then called on the Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of architecting everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the written arrest order, explained that the Piromelli case had been brought up to ask for a variation in the A3 project.
From the environmental interviews ordered against Dal Torione, writes the pm, "the availability of a entrepreneur, representing a larger group of not-so-called Piromalli, is denied "the ability to marry the needs of a entrepreneur, representing a larger group that is well-knownly close to Piromelli, uniforming the choices of public administration to the interests of the coast".
When energy is born from where they now come into the field and big
It is a cut-off, which covers over 70% of the planet's surface and is now being eliminated by the world's major energy companies.
Where, running, sea are the new renewable sources on which the eyes have been placed, and now they try to put their hands, such as the Chevron.
The possibility of getting energy from the sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental conditions and the new oil increase pushed the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the world's electricity demand could be covered by water-based power plant.
This amount would be the double of what is currently produced by nuclear power stations.
And more would be the currents and the seas.
I'm close to the attack.
The first shipping company was Enersis, who signed an agreement to build an plant in North Portugal in 2005.
When the intention was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
For two years, it has always been more and more of these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on oceanic energy - he has said that the carrier of a company associated with the U.S. oil column in the economic day Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned concerns the granting of a permit from the United States Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy-use project in Alaska.
It is a signal that is not very small, especially if it is considered that in Alaska, the Usai continue to extract oil and President Bush has recently launched a plan for new triumphs.
In addition to Chevron, there are New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to travel the way of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, as it is not known in the details, according to observers, indicate an interest in the rise.
Technology to put the point.
Experts are still talking about a technology for trees, even because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as that Portuguese or some in Scotland are small sizes and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a wide scale, however, technology needs to be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bonding between them.
The thrust of the waves, which makes the boots move up and down here is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders within the galleys.
Pressure causes a turbine to turn into a generator.
The electricity is ordered to flow through submarine cables.
To date, there are four installations of this type of design, awaiting only federal approval and part of energy could serve for a military installation.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when there are the seas rotates the bubbles of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After where, ma'am.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Energy Research, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or waves and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is about the energy of the seas that were like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others who are on the coast, have already invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
