At the end of the exchanges, Prague Bascula's boutique in the negative
After the fall in the morning, Prague's boutique rectifies its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ actions reach almost half the normal daily exchanges.
Mardi, from the start of the exchanges, the Prague bourse refurbished with her loss of the guard, when she lost almost six percent.
This time, the drop is due to the drop of actions at Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote by the House of American Representatives, which refuses to adopt the US financial sector stabilisation plan, is also understandable to us.
The Court of Justice in Asia
Asian bourgeoises experience a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indicators succeed, during the day, to remove some of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hong Kong boutique index loses four percent during the negotiations, but later, it erases some of the losses and reduces the drop to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises' index following the movement of Chinese actions in Hong Kong borough lost 3.8 per cent, the markets are closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's bourgeois shares were more than five percent, but finally we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, Taiwan's Bourse lost 3.6 per cent.
"The harassment of the US rescue action will affect the financial markets worldwide," observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, he has established his own monetary policy, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should immediately resume negotiations and adopt the financial system support proposal.
On the other hand, other countries would risk being affected.
The Blood Ban of American Actions
Monday, the House of American Representatives rejected the financial system support project, which it had to allocate up to $700 billion (about 12 billion in Kč).
The legislators are thus calling for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
America's actions take place, Monday, a blood bath, and major indicators of action are known to be the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index was lost almost seven percent, having known a fall of such a disgrace for the last time in 1987.
The index had already been lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was free of charge.
Congress passed: U.S. Government can inject $700 billion into banks
The heads of file of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement to the American financial system.
It will be submitted to the vote at the beginning of the next week.
American legislators made a decisive turn in the discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 billion), granted to the American financial system.
Success is not so sure.
In fact, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must conclude a number of details of the agreement.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed Monday at the Chamber of Representatives.
The President of the Board's Board's Banking and Financial Regulation Committee said Sunday.
According to sources, early Wednesday, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to the economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor in the destruction of financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which aid to markets can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent opinions about the form that should have the package of measures for market stabilization," Commissioner Nancy Pelosi confided to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be held this morning.
On Saturday evening at noon, the representatives of the legislators met with the Minister of American Finance Henry Paulson to give the Government a final form.
This should, in the case of financial companies, buy invasive real estate assets that lead financial enterprises to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety.
"We are on the point of agreeing on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has considerable impact on the markets of actions that fall.
According to the democratic senator Harry Reid, the legislators are making it possible for Congress to enter into a final agreement this morning.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of the Congress could affect trade in Mondays.
But for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, even if negotiations are not likely to be blocked at the latest by such a problem or problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law is still subject to changes.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it has the possibility of blocking the grant of the remaining amount, following two steps: firstly, $100 billion additional, then, to conclude, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in negotiations
Although the President may refer his vote to this decision, the Congress has the opportunity to make it a minor.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the acquisition of bad real estate securities, including the value of loss, was that hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages.
"All the work is done.
The Chamber of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday in the vote of the Act, and the Senate Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush is very pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the shared effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Delimitation of expensive parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of St. Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors against losses, the agreement on deterioration, the implementation of the plan on the axis of time.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of the cash balances for the directors of companies participating in the programme and for the establishment of a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Department of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made important progress towards an agreement that will make and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides for assistance for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new accounts in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the monthlyities of the lenders and allowing the latter to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to the economic leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"This is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and price of asset recovery will be.
This will be determined to reduce the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is now adopted, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not, according to Marek, as important as that.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time," Marek points out.
An extreme battle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you how to choose
While practically all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player is able to phone.
It seems clear that it is best to buy only a telephone.
It does not prevent there is enough reason to seek an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-level gramophone to put Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the other hand, such music products do not appear on a glass disk, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
But, if there are in your glass-plated windows, with rock art, jazz or blues, you probably smell at least one gramophone like that.
The same is true of music while moving, namely compressed music, for the sake of simplicity - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a fan of Pink Floyd would have the wrong to support the audiences bought for twenty crowns in the market.
There are two extremes, among which there is enough space for the whole world.
The choice is wide.
The life span of batteries is also decisive
Some high-level music readers are capable of much more than a simple music reader, but there are some unknown features of most mobile phones.
No current device is as universal as your phone.
In addition to the first functions, the phone calls and the sending of SMS, it is able to read music and movies, to record them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you take it into account the smartphones and communications, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows the meat griller and no TV will take pictures, we actually help with a miracle.
But the universal character of the mobile is not inconceivable.
The number of functions you use is greater, the range between two reloads will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy Goinfres.
There are rare mobiles that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases this number is just below.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are much more successful.
In the case of well-marketed mobiles, tell them they'll only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you are able to call time in time, you are looking for a second recharge for work - which is even valid for the most expensive devices.
This problem will not be addressed to MP3 readers, who are capable, following a reloading, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performance.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connection, so much more that all cannot be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take it without reducing it, given the minimum sizes of memory cards used in mobile phones.
As for readers, you do not need any software except iPod.
It is enough to complete, through the USB connector, the music device coming from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then after the user's judgment.
Some devices display only a tree structure index, such as Windows Explorer, others are capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more knowledge and experience
In selecting a specific device, you are especially interested in the life of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of output of the device and, of course, the ease of command.
If music is for you, essentially, a sound of the background and if in the day you are going to hear that for a limited period of time, for example by taking the tram, you have enough of any mobile to read MP3.
Virtually all mobile phones are available today.
You are not even required to pay too much attention to music formats than the mobile or reader is able to read.
All come to read the MP3s and the large majority of the music that will reach until you have this format.
It is part of the most recent format and, on the other hand, the vast majority of the devices are also reading the WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple firm and its iPods) is less consistent with it.
High-level mobiles also allow, for example, online music purchase.
It is enough to visit the operator’s (or other supplier’s) website from the port phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service to him alone should be a convincing reason for seeking a music mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunate and it limits, in most cases, to fast-acting radio tubes.
Prices are no longer lower.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the Internet, or the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone.
Every time you want to hear something, you just get out of your pocket's cell phone, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
But it is also important if you always have a listening ear or a hand-free with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated inputs, which have practically all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main benefit of musical furniture is their price.
The lowest prices usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three and four thousand crowns, a walkman can already be very convenient.
Or, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best telephones and the best outlets, as well as an entry for ordinary listeners, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Indeed, anyone who comes to ensure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which does not necessarily correspond to the least expensive ones (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the comparison of the order with that of a caste post, closely used in the past, or a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet that is sold by hazard, followed by an enormous data transmission factor.
Which device to choose
Even the most expensive mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you are not going to exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Base models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive come out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and you still want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a well-iding.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding audiences, choose more specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent command clicks for MP3, and that is how the delay of the command is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 readers sold separately, is the one who has gone the farthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life span of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) above, is ensured by a MP3 reader produced by one of the above marks.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, our operators proposing practically the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we still lack the same thing - a virtual operator, who would force classic operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, today, on Mobile.cz, the fact that the Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÜ (Techéque des Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in our company than in the rest of the Union, has also confirmed it.
This is why, following the recent failure of the European Commission to regulate roaming costs, a paradoxal situation is likely to occur - the SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czechia remain so high, compared with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may appear to be paradoxical, since we have three mobile networks and a painting that exceeds 100 per cent.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this connection, Pavel Dvorák, President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (STU), who stated on several occasions that there was no place for another operator in Czech territory, made a mess with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network did not appear to have more chance (also, at present, he would find only difficult frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is just the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market that led to a considerable decrease in prices, which should therefore also be the response of classic operators.
However, even before the entrance of the parties, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today in Great Britain were allowed to be heard in.
But it turns out that he was left of the place for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are no longer obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual Mobilking operator.
In only six months, this operator managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country.
We add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has the U:fon in Czech.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is also true in the world, virtual operators are described as low-cost operators - they offer calls and good-market SMS, which is often opposed by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers at least twice as expensive as its competitors in Great Britain.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, joining an unusual target group can also be a good part of advertising.
In fact, this operator specifically refers to men.
"The real men choose Mobileling - a operator that they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could be possible to walk with us, too.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman, is in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
More than that, it is relatively satisfied with the point of view of the provision of services."
In Czech, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czechia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but in Czech, negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničkova, a spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in Chechnya were not, in any case, in favour of this idea.
Instead, they tried to do their best so that a potential competitor could not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which wanted to launch a new step to become a real Telephonika competition in the field of business customers, did not hide its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator for a long time.
"We have much to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services but also mobile.
And sooner or later it'll be the best.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility several times with all of the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have made progress in the negotiations," said Paul Kaidl's group spokesman.
So maybe the future is promising.
According to informal information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator already here at the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by complete silence.
"At this moment, we do not think that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is comparable to other very specific ones.
For the moment, no subject of a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sršeň of the Press Department of Telephonika O2 mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also report on the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2: "We have not registered for a viable and bilateral project, which could serve as a basis."
It adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in a limited time frame, we should now have a specific agreement."
Vodafone rather focuses on meeting requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we say means most of the customer views.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to put in place a common network for a quick mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The trend of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and therefore a decrease in their benefits.
What, then, is to facilitate the arrival of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to walk in the field. The girl accompanying the creation of the U:phone also bears witness.
The biggest pressure on ČTÜ, when the U:fon was created, was exercised by T-Mobile company.
It provides information available to the public on ČTÜ websites.
But today, the U:fon is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted on this subject: "The competition on the mobile market was, in addition, recently expanded by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would be subject to high requirements, and especially his services."
However, given the attitude of mobile operators as shown here, the difference between the Czech regulatory agencies appears to be overwhelming.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTÜ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, does not unfortunately have the power to intervene in economic competition in Czechia.
It belongs exclusively to the Agency for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But the latter adopts, facing this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the location of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this type has been concluded for the moment, because the offer of potential interests has not given sufficient priority to classical operators," explained Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the UOHS.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
However, on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among others, take care that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a statement is more than profitable.
More than Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the outside, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be found that their market access has contributed to a low price of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in terms of fair market functioning and low prices does not appear to be part of the interests of the UOHS.
What's really shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it's really a hazard, is all of a sudden.
Similarly, a price of strictly identical essence to all service stations is certainly due to the Hasard and the difficulty in combating competition.
"The office has not, in this respect, identified signs of anticompetitive behaviour, therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way or in any other way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, no one therefore has an increased responsibility for their market behaviour.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," said Chaloupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÜ, which states that telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, one market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer another vision of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at all times.
And the mobile operator has logically enough monopole on his network.
This is how he needs to play a dominant role in a particular segment of his activity.
However, even without this argument, it should be at least alarmed to UOHS that three mobile operators appear to be in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the Novera GTS company mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Responsibilities on the ČTÜ are a fairly current tour in the communications, through which the UOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, there was no success in the modernization of the Telecommunications Act, recently adopted, an extension of the ČTU's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts had promised to improve the situation.
This is what the representatives of the UOHS must know very well, but their interests appear to be on the other side.
When someone looks at us, it can go
That said, the functioning of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains invisible.
It is about companies publishing their own mobile phone service price list, but the latter are only published in part.
In most cases, there is a question of companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile telephone services are thus offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are generally available only for elections.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company is made before the operator of a classic company, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such return.
"If what you're talking about was happening, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions we're considering and could result in an end to collaboration with the company in question," answered our question on this issue, Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that an event of such activity would not have been achieved until the mobile operators were responsible.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of clients.
No operator shall, however, object to such procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms bring them non-binding benefits, and at the same time, by opposition to verifiable virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of non-reliable customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot have it in full, as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that is exactly what should appear strange in the ČTU.
In addition, another question is raised at UOHS.
If operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to trigger such an activity, and if he does not wish to enjoy the interpretations of operators, who claim that there is no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prevent him from doing so.
When we won't be the best country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has brought a considerable drop in the price of services.
But, practically in all countries where virtual operators appeared, classic operators were forced, therefore, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a very small market, too happy to see, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulatory agencies have intervened in developed countries, not in the interests of mobile operators, but in their clients.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they have completed the creation of a first virtual operator followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue in the form of a hot soil pump that is decommissioned by sending it to a close target.
Based on the experiences we have, we cannot be distracted from the impression that confusion in competences is more beneficial in these cases.
But don't throw the missing after the wedding.
If the information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will not be able to easily remain insensitive to the rejection (to discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may have stopped calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech National Hymme.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presents separately the new registrations of my national host KDE domov (Where is my homeland?).
The hemne was again registered by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a single male or female song, a heart interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is guaranteed by Katerina Kniežinkova et Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the immune system.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bélohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český dihläs (the Czech public radio), he chose to interpret the only versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that the two singers, as well as the heart, had a good speech, so that we understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he explained.
The Czech national ceremony, next year, is 175th anniversary.
The song Kde doov my first time in 1834 on the beaches of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), the original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music by Frantisšek Škroup.
It has become popular and people have been able to do it spontaneously.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple became naturally an integral part of the nation's immune system.
It will remain one of seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How the new hymne sound
Frequent transport (MHD) will introduce the powder in their ticket system.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be included in the history of Pražský Doravní mp firmnik (the Pragose Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers, trams and buses, who, instead of having a ticket on paper, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latest is available for almost a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard stand card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and then register on their free-of-charge card in the information points and offices of the Transport Agency, located at the Metro Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrad, Kacherov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying coupons online on the web pages of Transportní business: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people enjoyed the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget the cookies in the metro stations, where they have to keep up to this point with patience in long bags in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will purchase their coupon via the Internet and register it on their card Opencard in one of the thirteen Mästská knýovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, the passengers have a ticket with a trained staff, which will help those interested in buying online and will also record the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrní.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding machines to make tickets and passengers may already have been marked at Roztyly, Budéjoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, it should have four-thirty," Opatrní added.
An automatic controller at the position of the driver
Automotives that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
It is enough to enter the opencard card and the previously purchased coupon will be registered on the card itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding areas of the city.
It is known in the bus trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the residents of the central Boheme municipality to access the capital.
"In integrated trains in Pražská integrated transporta (integrated transport from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and regional validity of the couples," explained the control of Filip Drapal tickets of the Ropid organization, which includes the hours of transport in common Prague.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card readers in the driver's box.
It is therefore necessary to show not only the card to the driver but also to place the Oppencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered couples.
"Where the passenger would need to verify the validity of registered couples, there is nothing more simple than to ask the driver for this information," Drapal adds.
Passengers who do not take periurban buses and will not remember the date on which they express their spouse’s validity may re-connect the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the card.
This is where, on the device screen, information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudanese claimed a referendum in the United States
In 1945, the Germans of the Soviet Union demanded that Sumava be integrated into the United States.
This is the source of a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knýovna (The Scientific Library of the South Boheme).
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the U.S. patronage.
In 1945, certain groups of Southern Germany addressed the President of the United States with such a wish.
This is from another letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedeká knyovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov claim in the letter that the American President will not allow "shuumavská zupa" (in the southern Boheme forest region) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to the Czech Republic.
"We well understand the situation and want to be sure that the words that the American troops claim to come to the German territory are not in the enemy and enemy but in the liberators," is written in the letter, "People whose fate is in the heart."
Since the relationship with Czechoslovakia is not likely to be promising - being aware of the Czech national character - but of brutality, indifference, incompetence, oppression and servicelessness, the authors of the letter urge the American President to take into his hands the protection of the Chumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you will give this territory to a foreign state, which will stop and destroy minorities and which has nothing to do with the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of millions of people," wrote the letter.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for the sale of the "chechic printers".
If the President of the United States had doubts about the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would have only organized a referendum in the region to determine whether his people wanted to be part of the United States, or whether he would live under the U.S. patronage.
While the text in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, appears somewhat naïve, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Soviet Union.
While the Czech Germans had to at least intervene that the issue of their expulsion from the Republic would be raised, very few of them would accept such an opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain some sort of autonomy for the Soviets.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, not in České Budéjovice, confirmed it.
During the war, he was, as German of České Budéjovice, engaged in the sea in the Baltic States.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, and dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to learn the Czech language.
"They believed that once they returned to their homes, the Czech would be beneficial," said Chalupa.
None of the Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war did not appreciate it, according to him, that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
You don't think about it - your countries!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Aleš Rébeček believes that it will discourage drivers from a dangerous behaviour on a flight.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from running fast and alcohol.
But also remind them to take the penthouse before starting.
In particular, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorists, peetons, without forgetting professional drivers.
What's going to appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also testifies to the slogan "sangling" of the entire campaign:
You don't think about it - your countries!
The phrase "You don't reflect" is inscribed in upper case on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood bottle, there's the phrase "Your Payers".
What must symbolize that we can pay for life a moment of attention.
The spots will "hand" the spectators until 2010.
The Department has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen jointly with tragic images of the victims of accidents.
It is believed that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and lead strategy against drivers
"What goes with drivers is the system of sugar and lead.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by winning time when they shine a red fire.
The foot, it's the threat of an amnesty or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to drivers," says Martin Kořán, the psychologist for the transport of the Na Homolce hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, which is considered psychological.
Panels indicating the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static panel protecting against a danger is installed, it will probably merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán reports.
Olmert would exchange peace for almost all the territories occupied
Ehud Olmert, President of the Israeli Provisional Government, is in favour of the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordanian, East Jerusalem and the heights of the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in a published interview Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost every territory (occupied), that is all," said Olmert every day.
"We keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage (from the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be done," he added.
He admits that the possible restoration would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not wish that any traitors and bulldozers break his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, should return to the parts of Jerusalem," observed Olmert, referring to two attacks in the city in July when several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will be obliged to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't go," he pointed out immediately.
Extract of Golan's heights
Olmert is also in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the heights of the Golan, which, according to him, constitutes an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan withdrawal," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to withdraw from their current relations with Iran; they will have to withdraw from their relationship with Hezbollah (slow movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (close movement), Al-Kaïda (terrorist network), as well as Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the Stewarts in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the student agency's car near Padoue, Italy, the question arises whether drivers and passengers can move within the car during the trip.
"If we wanted to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a staird is contrary to the road traffic law," said Karel Hanzelka, the spokesman of the Department of Transport.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old guest died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the car.
The young girl was at this bad time sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats.
However, the car may have an accident, want to freeze in a harsh manner, also at the time when the driver uses the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the auto car is based on its technically equipped seating plate or not.
If this equipment for duty stations is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance bus Student Agency does not have proper seats; this has been confirmed at Newsnö.cz by the company director Radim Jancura.
"It is a question that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits the movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we found that passengers could go to the toilets during the trip, provided they had their own seat," he explained his position.
The law ignores the Stewart
"There is no uniform legal interpretation of the role of Stewart - no legal requirement is involved in this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement no longer prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act is only known as the vehicle receiver's term; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka's spokesman with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorní, Director of the Road Traffic Department, on the contrary, considers the law to be sufficiently problematic.
"All depends on the fact that the author has in his approval permission to propose places of origin.
Everyone lives here," he said.
Cars are divided into urban areas, where there are limits and maximum speeds, interurbans with destinations and a higher authorized speed and long distance without parking with the highest authorized maximum speed and equipped seating of safety belts.
Like in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Horīn, a BESIP expert in road safety in transport, does not see the shift of the rails on board as a major problem.
"In a regular cycle, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
Besides, it's not safe when a turbulence occurs and the air's heat can be turned off."
"Or, in the case where the car would have been frozen in a brutal way, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in a urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stairwells by internal requirements," he said, and he also believes that the problem is not resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only car carrier to offer Stewards services.
He owes it two hundred.
Even after this incident, the Director does not consider them to be a risk measure.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that it is a risk measure, I will overcome it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and journals on board.
That would also reduce the costs," he said.
The security concerns are the reason why there are no stawards in his vehicles the director of Asiaan Alexei Lithuania, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We haven't had hosts. We've been against them since the beginning.
Soon or later it will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has occurred
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for society for two years, died on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using cliché and blocked the road to the car.
The driver of this last attempt to avoid it by means of a brutal manoeuvre, but he did it by his right hand.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the chairs have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company is about to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
In order to discourage the family of the young girl, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but in the case of financial compensation, it will also rely on the offender.
A change of law?
Do Not View
An amendment to the Act, which has been developed for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movement of drivers on the road.
"Or, she has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she doesn't care much about buses, but rather about the point system, the maximum speed on the car and the use of the laptop by flying," said expert Horín.
"The Department of Transport does not consider the activities of the drivers as a major threat to passengers' safety," concludes Hanzelka's spokesman, stating that road safety control is under the authority of the police and the work security office.
The hope of the Düsseldorfeis rests on Francfort.
The great words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the household employees.
From a union of Düsseldorf's financial institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Parkasse Financial Group" could be constituted, according to the public monthly e-mail.
WestLB would bring a double "competence block" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
In any case, such a relationship could be the cut in sending decisions to other concentrations in the banking sector of the Landers.
It refers to what it looks like when a Steering Committee intends to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is always under a strong pressure.
This is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority for the Supervision of Financial Services, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of Northern Rhineland of Westphalia that the time was spent looking for a future solution.
However, it has been a long time since - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship between the Deka bank, which was known to the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB.
The head of the Delta-Bank Franz Waas made it clear when he presented the figures at the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of the Landstrasse Mainzer with a bank in Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is supported every half by the banks of the Lander and by the team of savings caches, commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be due to the financial market, or parts of it.
The speakers, however, come only to begin, said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, accounts for one of the most important employees on the financial scene in Frankfurt, is in play when it comes to strengthening the savings sector.
In 2003 it was believed that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the State of Rhénanie Palatinat and Halbab.
Nothing, however, is derived from this underground hole.
Unfortunately, the plans had been made public that the Government of Hesse had committed itself against all the participation of Hellala in those areas.
As a result, the other two houses were no longer united.
The Bank of the Land of Rhenanie Palatinat was attached to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treaties on the deka-Bank grouping with Länder banks.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellala Steering Committee, was, however, against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
In spite of this, the feeling seems to spread that the grouping of the different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the State of Bavaria has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could be established in any first place.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure required for new mergers had to be increased, the potential partners would have to get away with it a little bit.
In the South, she would now be a young partner, although she was even better resistant to the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
Hesse-Thuringe's savings and operations group, which has 85 percent of Helaba's capital, has again taken a turn at the beginning of the year on the whole association with WestLB.
He'd stay at the NorthLB.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the faces.
Another facet is the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be addressed.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question, which would have given the future capacity of the banks of the Land, had not been resolved until it was resolved by the German group of savings and operations.
In the end, a WestLb depression may have a place, a depression that is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is asked in the letter of the Committee of Directors in place: in any case, a 'global solution' would be intended for the establishment.
How all of this will be put in the same panel with the unity of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied her as a little friend, and so nothing is the same, she said.
Behind them, close to five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built barbu that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival whose deep sounds his master can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then she's snoring.
From Bologna, they've come to Verone.
From there, from the train station near the new Porta train, four buses take the departure at 23h45 this evening, 'Destinazione Monaco, festival della Birra', arriving at 6h30.
Three buses are primarily reserved for Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already on their team, they have already celebrated the last night.
And also funny, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which carries a long double handle of falsified furniture and sunglasses to large silver mountains.
For five years, they've been at the festival of the beer, and they've been doing nothing but this year.
They go out there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 2:30 a.m.
And spending the night would mean unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs EUR 75, including the welcome with a Kaiser beer, broken in accordance with the Bavarous Cleaning Act, sickness insurance and a German-speaking group's responsibility - Marco has conducted a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already running in the night on the highway direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, there's no beer yet.
Soon, everything gets quiet in the bus, the passengers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
There will be breaks in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates make another break before Munich, on the 8th highway.
In the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at 6:30 as planned on the parking near Thérèse Square, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco have a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, it covers the small yellow caskette.
The above is written on the left 'Biere Festival', in Gothic, and on the internet address of Marco's travel agency `conescersiggiado.it'.
Second: "When the doors of the bed's head open, we're short," Marco cries in the morning.
'Run!' Run and reserve the places at the bottom of the tent.
'Not before, but we are blocked, and not all the young caskets on the same banks, they must be divided into the room!'
The boat, it creates Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the sign!
'Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're part!'
Thirdly: 'In the evening, come back here at ten and a half hours!'
And that's it, it's part of the beer party.
On the way, some new snowy caskets to the trees to find the way, the panels, and even an electoral display of a large part of the Bavarois population.
We have to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the festival of beer, known as the 'week-end of Italians'.
There are no specific figures; it is said that 50,000 people are on their way through the Alps and are based in the beer kitchen, 10 percent of visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police, by Italian volunteers supporting the Bavarous Red Cross, which provides statistics on the countries where the Italians take the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
What is especially appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu Brasserie.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Actors
The German banking system was relatively stable, and the Federal Minister for Finance insisted that only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician was to use the word 'relatively' and that the German banking sector would not be separated by crisis movements.
It's actually over this weekend.
The finance of the Bavarois Himo Real Estate (HRE), on the DAX, receives from a German banking firm a billion credit to protect themselves from market disturbances.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the aid credits were delivered up to €35 billion.
The Real Estate Hypo should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it is the Deffa daughter company that suffers losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state finances were refinanced very short-term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the failure to market.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the own capital rate had also decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net benefits resulting from financial transactions were, in relation to the same period, at zero, the benefits resulting from the allocation of defined credit and mobile values, as well as the disposal of supplies in credit operations had decreased by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only due to the significant benefits from the reimbursement of the cost of accounting from the restructuring of the former Defa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the Concern companies that the deficit of around 16 per cent has appeared to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financial authority had at first miscellaneous expectations about real estate industrial credits, which were then affiliated to the Aareal Bank.
Since the funding of the classic state was not profitable enough, the Deffa was then committed more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects among private and state investors (Privacy-Privacy, PPP) and internationally differentiated.
In terms of the value of the company, the Real Estate Hypo has to deal with amortisations that should have an essential material effect that remains even if enough flow is done.
The fact is that the dividends were beaten.
Already for 2007, they had been beaten to two thirds.
The Real State Hypo has been a state and infrastructure investor since the Deffa strike.
It is stronger than other institutions that rely on interbank refinancing because it has no customer deposit.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks was again significantly higher, the banks that accumulated their liquidity.
The Real State Hypo needs an annual part - about 50 billion euros - of the entire Defa credit for a short-term refinancing.
According to a report from the Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets far beyond the current market status.
Other sources say that the refinancing would be ensured through the funds by the end of 2009.
The Chairman of HRE Georg Funke's Steering Committee explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer use financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) are beginning with the principle that the capacity of the Real Hypo Group on the market is now ensured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors are just waiting for it.
However, in view of the dynamic and impoverishable nature of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is also not necessary that he should not resort to funding in all its scope.
But the opposite can no longer be separated.
Following the fact that, according to the latest communications, even at the doors of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least temporary will no longer be possible to satisfy the spirit no longer.
The course of action was 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The courses of obligations, however, are particularly good.
While the debts to the first head have fallen, the courses of the second plan loans are fragmented.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo company and the well-known ones who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The liabilities of the Hippo Real Estate bank seemed to be an alternative speculative position, but now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net collapse of the banking crisis and the institution's crisis, which led to the crisis in the establishment of the Depfa bank.
As emission institutions, less affected governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that arrangements can be withdrawn in time.
Or it will happen what no one can expect at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the face of renewed noises from partial nationalism, the likelihood of approaching success today has become a common hope.
This should provide sleepless nights for the long-term creditors on the decision to know whether they must separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use this on what they have drawn up to constitute a report of losses for the next few years on the next tax on income of automatic profit gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the boat in Bento
When Sylviana Hiltrop, aged 16, has to be present for the first day at the Tachibana High School, girls start to smile: Germany is so "kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word through the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks from Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
That's what I was excited about.
Already the way to school made me afraid.
I live in Tokyo's Periphery in Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I have to find the way alone, I'm glad I'm not lost.
The start of courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as we are in Basse-Saxe.
The students appear after each other from eight hours until at least nine o'clock, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not of any kind to talk to people, especially to a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet had the uniform of school, I put an old jape from my mother's home, as well as a dress, blue mountain shoes and black leather shoes.
In this case, I was presented to the bishop, and I tried to make the correct statement: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At this point, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have done all the low-fashioned exercises, smiles and signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him with my hands.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary for the survival of Japanese ados and means "mingon, chou".
Then I quickly slip into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she found that it was a honor that the person should sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong was lifted, I was relieved in the rules.
Everyone talked to who was better, who could laugh and ask me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand English.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My mother-in-law had also done this kind of Lunchbox - that's really something the Germans are merciful.
I had rice for aromatic trees, small sauces, a concoction salad and algae, fruit and a kind of meat around Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's sure is that everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the sandy sprays, brrrrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, which is then especially carefully prepared - in the hope of getting a little more knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read it in my hands.
I'm curious to know if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"Because it makes me wonder what"
After all, reading manganese is what I've been doing for years.
And in order to better understand the manganese and culture that is, at one time, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was very clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the other hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
The rats also have feelings
A rat or a horse was in danger, does that mean he's also feeling afraid?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we make sure that he tries the same thing when he behaves the same way we do?
In the "Edge" online magazine, contributions have been published for many years by prominent scientists.
Online SPIEGEL is present in a series of answers to the question "What do you think you can't prove?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness states without me or anyone else until now can prove anything as we can't prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least expect all human brains to present the same configuration.
As long as we turn to other species and deal with sensitive issues or in general conscience, we will be imprisoned in difficult places because the Hardware does not respond.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he makes death, he was or he was attacked.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists take it down to a comparable subjective angle.
However, I don't think so.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transfer of our subjective tissue to the difficult animals.
One of the aspects is that the associated circuits are almost always in human consciousness including the Frontal Cortex (because of their participation in the short term memory and in the management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
At least, therefore, for these aspects of our conscience which depends on the Cortex prefrontal, including the consciousness of whom we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human beings are even different from other primates.
Another significant particularity could exist in the language of man: a large part of his existence is connected to his language, which often means that his conscience is dependent on him.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that the animal conscience, whatever the way it is produced, would be very different from most of our state of consciousness.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what conscience may be like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow neither to measure nor, because of this particular hardware, to analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the universe conscious, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientificly.
The awareness processes of animals could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of conscience than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the Cortex prefrontal in the realization of the visualization.
But what is the result for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain is conscious of its own activity.
So what we refer to as "pour" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the system of defense located in the brain (or its consequences, like the reactions of the body) falls from the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially the Human.
A degree of subtils of feeling, associated with our volable nature, weakens, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, distinguish and classify states to impose them on others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio believes, for example, that the feelings arising from primitive activities arise in the regions of Cortex's body sensation and brain trench, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the brain trench.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could actually participate in all sorts of transversal feelings.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I believe it is indisputable.
Pankseep is aware that what is like fear in men and in rats is probably also felt like this in both cases: how can we, however, verify whether the rats and men feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A coward was in danger, but what if he was afraid?
In my eyes, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical vices.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain cramps, capherds on the contrary do not even have a brain.
But is the brain tendon the source of feelings?
And even if we could prove it to the Man, how could we show it in the rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, maybe even the cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are completely different from ours (because human conscience is based on special circumstances and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour of the races.
In all cases, progress is based on the nerve level in the same way that we eat in rats and humans.
Like I don't explore language and conscience in rats, or feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It could be judged as a short term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly getting caught up against a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, UEFA President: a time of gratitude for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European champions," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the construction or destruction of stations, streets, hotels and airports, the two hotels run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European champion could be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigory Surkis.
"The U.S.A. has been constantly looking at us."
A more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN is not able to act in the rules," Drzewicki of the Polish press agency PAP said.
"We made sure in an e-mail to the President of the UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship were not suffering."
Several members of the First Division Link were already convicted of the previous season for the manipulation of compulsory relegation; finally, the beginning of the League has even been cancelled at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid Against Attack
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now she's dreaming with her ex: the Hollywood Star Meg Ryan raised the road to her ex-in-law Dennis Quaid.
The Ecume - and counter-attack.
A late Russian war for former couples Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood players are engaged in a terrible battle - in the eyes and under the eyes of the whole world.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for the American InStyle newspaper on the causes of the breakup of the marriage: "Dennis has been to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have learned about the extent of the trompy only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought is in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - the story of an adult is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his invalid husband's qualifications is clear: this would be "Montreals", he said to the New York Daily News, 54 years old, that "I will reexamine the history of our relationship and the manipulative".
This would be more "recordable" than "the pain and confusion that make a divorce for each child to be relived in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has recovered and will soon become his adoptive father.
So it was her answer to the flu: "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that goes to the best."
Air ticket prices and hotel prices are low
In the first half of 2008, the flights and hotel nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the U.S. travel service provider.
The company analysed its reservation data in the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased over the years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of 48 European cities still under review by 6.9 per cent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices had already been 3.6 percent lower than last year.
The trend was particularly clear in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay from 30 to 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all of this would be for American Express in the low dollar course that led to "the desire to travel down the American tourists".
Financial locations such as Frankfurt or London would be more affected by hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanovre, Colonne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are rising by 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also in the price of flights, the trend was to increase in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kirozen, the economic class passengers paid an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-range flights, very fuel consumers, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices for tickets in economic class dropped by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in class and in first class, however, the price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices were even more important than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this loss of prices would on the one hand be a flexible economic growth, explains the firm.
The application would fall from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the "Open Sky" Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the situation is the removal by air carriers of non-permanent routes, as well as the high number of air carriers that would have deposited the balance during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV Gladbach 1:0
With a purpose and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the first to classify.
In Borussia, Luhuka has not always managed to find a functional eleven.
From Christopher Klein. Agrandir. Disaster attack for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only enter the game later and his up-and-to-date turn was hidden from the target frame.
His message was precisely formulated, it was from his lips in a persuasive manner.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," says Hermann Rieger in the clothing industry in Hamburg.
It wasn't a big thing in the clothes, the middle time was over and most of them were in their place.
Rieger had been HSV's physiotherapist for nearly three decades, and he had a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at strategic locations.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol obtained and raised his finger to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach in Hamburg, Martin Jol.
Their orders seem to have been similar: and that's how it works with this second purpose!
The implementation has failed.
"It wasn't very nice to see you today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sudacity also to be more restrained."
This is 1:0 (1:0 in the mid-term), the Hamburg team has to hit the head successfully by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very low players in Gladbach could not harm the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a victory hall," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV celebrates its 121-year-old Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the screen and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first class.
That's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can take the rest," said Marcel Jansen.
There is no doubt that the intermediate result of the table reflects more than the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its recently engaged arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Petric goal guard as well as Jansen debaxed by the FC Bayern - is well-formed, but it is not bright yet.
"We need more charm and more drives," demanded Joel.
After the vote
At Wall Street, the fear of the circle.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan has temporarily cut down the Dow Jones 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones was a little bit distracted.
By 20 a.m., the world's largest bourgeoiser index was 10.579 points with a drop of 5 percent.
The Nasdaq technology base index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most lost of the Dow Jones were the American Express, which had lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could report benefits anymore.
Bank Goldman Sachs' actions charged a drop of almost 10 percent.
A few days ago, major investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
In the context of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called broken hypothetical paper.
However, the sum must not be paid at once, but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the actions of the financial company that could be correlated to the evolution of the course in order to reduce the burden on the public treasurer.
Courses of action expected in the tournament in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not raise the concerns of investors.
The course of the action of the Grand German Bank Hippo Real Estate will collapse and take the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is growing despite the saving of the state's financial market.
The German index (Dax) has led to a deep deficit in the Hypo Real Estate and the Commercial Bank.
In spite of the federal government's rescue operation and private banks, the Bavarois real estate fund has currently lost three quarters of its value, the Commercial Bank has charged more than 20 per cent.
The Dax is clearly below the important psychological barrier of 6,000 points and is estimated at 5.839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
In the world, the markets of action have fallen to a low level.
In New York, Wall Street would work with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the $700 billion debt saving plan of the Government of the United States could not be sufficient to restore financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points were lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The United States Chamber intended to vote on the salvation plan, and the Senate vote should be held on 1 October.
The other European exchanges have also known only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 has charged a decrease of 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index of Nikkei fell to 11.743,61 points after an increase of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped from 2.1 per cent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main index of Sensex lost 506,43 points to 3.9 percent and closed to 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's actions fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new actions.
The multinational trade and tourism has further indicated that action will not be sold in Thomas Cook.
The dark matter influences the flight of space sounds
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers with perplexity: the dark matter influences the speed of space sounds during what is called gravitational support manuals.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has gone into space.
Because of the recent ice-cream behaviour, death is a threat.
For years, a mystery phenomenon has been a cause of development among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they obtain an additional gap in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, the Earth, for example.
Thus, the sounds can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical habit, as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what surprises researchers over the years: the flying objects do not always behave as 100 percent of the way we expect them to be according to the verifiable laws of gravity.
In addition, irregularities occur at the speed level.
The sounds become sooner or later unexpected.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him in the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativity, which describes the force of attraction for the fact that the atmosphere's curve might not be completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study believed that Einstein was not mistaken and tried to explain the anomaly of gravitational support through what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers know the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It appears that it is an attractive force whose effect is observed on other celestial bodies.
In contrast, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientific calculations, the black matter would represent a very good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists taken to Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their rapists, the children's tourists in Egypt should be released and the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
Sudanese rapists had demanded a sum of several million euros.
During the fusion prior to release, six hostages would have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were removed.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be undertaken.
The Germans are without a stop in the Kidnappere Collimate.
WELT ONLINE covers the most important cases.
European tourists born in Sahara are obviously free.
This is what has been reported as a concert of Egypt's state television, Al-Arabia Arab TV channel and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television channel tickets Sky TG 24: "Our concietuss and other hosts were released.
We're checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian co-rapporteurs are well and safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants in the wilderness should already be on the road to Cairo.
The circumstances around a fusion prior to the release of hostages remain afloat: thus, the kidnappers would have been nearing a deadline for the removal, according to the words of an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without calling the war.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
There's nothing else but to gather the otags," when the sodain, "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers had beaten on this Sunday six rapists in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two of them had been arrested.
The arresters had demanded a sum of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be paid by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the article, journalists wanted to release women's hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men had to be held until the robbers found a safe route to escape.
The German ambassador in Cairo refused to comment on this record.
An abuse of a beautiful father who leads to suicide.
One court was informed that years of abuse by his father had led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from St. Stephens, in the Cornouilles, was imprisoned for six years after he had admitted eight charges for indistinct ways.
The grand court of Truro referred to his daughter, Stéphanie Randle, five to seven years old, regularly.
Tririse wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, was murdered in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise had attached her to her before forceing her into sexual acts, while her mother was working with the pop.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he will return to life in the Cornouilles.
Her beautiful daughter's going to Plymouth.
However, the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer of National Trust, had been subjected to abuse twice a week.
The Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told me that Melle Randle, who was a good superhero and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead since 2006” and “he had lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she got killed by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faces the beautiful father of his daughter, who had also written a confession letter that ended: "I attach her and the bandis regularly".
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Tracy: "You're really surprised as a fetish, your victim must have been a terrorist, especially at the age of 7.
"This displaced saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't done this thing, her story would never be finished at the court."
He added: "I stress in particular, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime on Stéphanie for years.
"Without those, she would certainly be a happy, promising young woman today."
Impunity for the loss of official data.
The Departmental Officer of the Office of the Cabinet, who had forgotten the top secret documents on a train in June, will be convicted by the Office of Secrets of the Act on behalf of the BBC.
The man from the Ministry of Defence was moving when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train headed by Waterloo.
The documents were passed in the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the most serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the key to the protection of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial Officer be placed under the auspices of the Metropolitan Police, seeing the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained appreciation for Al-Qaeda as well as for the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies face factor B&B.
The British construction companies could pay a bill of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million brands from Bradford & Bingleys.
Interests in this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savings money, including 59 companies in the building.
The Director-General of Building Companies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated that he is "irrequired" to know that companies and their members should pay for the losses ...
The loan of £14 billion will be reimbursed when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages will be released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be charged every year to 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It's a shock to see that institutions that had a good attitude now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each company has to pay a proportional sum to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies have to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest in the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to manage the interests of the first year.
Adrian Cole, Director-General of the Business Committee of the Construction Companies, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "freaking" to see that institutions that have had a prudent attitude in the recovery of the real estate market must now pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We must examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks, to assess the options to be taken to avoid the fact that construction companies and their members pay this paid bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from end September of this year to end March.
In 2010, interest will need to be paid for the entire year, which could also be doubled.
As construction companies are non-cooperative organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for the savings accounts.
The milk increases to five pennies per letter
Jersey's people have to pay more for their prayers
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the price of her milk, five pennies per letter, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from an increase in two pennies in February, followed by a research carried out by a consulting company.
The sellers must decide whether they go to their tour, increase the price for consumers.
. Before the increase in February, the large price of Jersey milk had been varied for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh has refused the causation
A court in Bangladesh rejected an appeal to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who was thus in danger of being arrested on his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his case because of his trial to have taken out a man in charge, 50 million Taka ($729,000) when he was a PM.
This case is one of the many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, still in Sheikh Hasina's rival, was released in prison earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh a few weeks ago, but his party, the League of Awani, asked the country's provisional military government to grant him its entire freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not stay free from her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying that she did not need to be cautious because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will submit an appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers argued that she needed this protection to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina should return after 17 October, said an old leader of the Awami party.
She was arrested last year after the military internal government took over power, but was released in June to care for abroad.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, not the charges they make.
Concerns about the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent anti-polo immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, said the United Nations.
The United Nations launched a vaccination campaign last week in the six provinces.
But she said she could not contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman stated that this was done despite the Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB lost the ITV judicial battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the Competition Commission’s verdict, which would require it to reduce its participation in its ITV rival.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares by 17.9 per cent to less than 7.5 per cent.
The Commission stated that, in the past, the participation of MSkyB had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence ITV incorrectly.
BSkyB purchased its parts in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB, of the ITV parties, raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, which consequently encouraged the Competition Commission to investigate
Virginia's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the Offcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB suggested that the effort to reduce its share of ITV would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, it was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just withdrawn from its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney-General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the issue of US nine prosecutors' licensing in 2006.
All was born in the case of the Chief Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the case of lawyers who claim that their license is due to political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy, will now investigate whether the investigators questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
" Serious charges of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor able to force witnesses to deposit was one of his greatest recommendations.
The debate began with the release in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formed by the Department of Justice of the United States.
At the time, the Department had stated that the prosecutors were licensed for medical benefits.
However, it would then emerge that licensed prosecutors were no more critical than their other colleagues, which would encourage some observers to assign political connotations to these licences.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of the Congress, while others would have refused to investigate false vote against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and pursuing the courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be licensed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The chief of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been accused of being involved in this licensing case and has finally been released.
A number of departmental officers of the Department of Justice have also given them their resignation.
The report of the Inspector-General was highly critical of Mr Gonzales' role in this regard, stating that he would consider him "the first responsible" of these licences, and ended with "ambache" his role as leader," which was clearly not involved in the case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush co-rapporteur Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The Pope of Meat Loaf must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscara at the ceremony in London next week, said to be "honored" to receive this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The award night is presented by Coldplay, with this year, with a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that cross things like time and nature, and Bat Out Of Hell is actually part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that takes almost two minutes.
The song was put on sale in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, classing into the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English classifications, and it was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, from his real name, suffered from health problems in recent years, even an operation to cure his heart beat became irregular after he was exposed to scene in 2003.
In 2007, a strong larynx forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we find him in the vocal cords.
A Rue Sombre in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Welcome to Sale.
New York has hundreds of adventures, bulevards, streets and other parallel routes, some famous, other only functional.
. And even some Veterans taxis as well as local residents of a long date cannot provide hints to go to Extra Place because they have never heard of them.
The street is located in the East Village and is on the north side of First Street to avoid confusion with Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it resembles a pulserized alley rather than an active arterial.
No panels show the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard Atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the construction of luxury property on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a more flexible passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbours, have declared themselves to be loved by this resort simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house's past.
But the Department of Conservation and Immobilier Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, during a meeting of the Committees of Neighborhood Owners, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay issued a proposal allowing the real estate builder to buy the street.
However, the Committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and called for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No.3.
"There are only a few spaces in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could suggest that he be released and managed, what other Avalon could do, but we want to keep him public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee that the builder would give the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the port of Avalon Bay, said that while society wants to operate the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned route, and make it public," she said, stressing that this was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Immobilier Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical impression.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the great farm of many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving this small drop of land, which remains after being abandoned.
The later entry of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous with the photo covering the album of Ramones "Rocket to Russia"
"this place was great" said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of irons, irons, bars, posters, fires and wires."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about evolution to the luxury of the East Village, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rare - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be settled in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (sub-titled "The Book of Contests: A View of Nostalgic Amerement on a City in the Extinction Process") relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small dark-sac-cracked, dark-day as night, and delimited by the doors of a routine iron and persentiaries, full of newspapers last week that revolve along the gouts."
With few exceptions close, the street always has the same distance.
A short rat is actively at the bottom of the street, near a door that was kept at the CBGB, and is now the seat of a chic clothing store.
graffiti on the walls, a 22 empty-eyed beer bottle, rest beside newspapers that are just getting out.
Some historians have stated that it is rare to think of Extra Place, and suggest that it be valued.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some undertook to consider the attractiveness of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were driven out in dark, wet and boring places."
The bilingual debate: Emerging in English
In this part of the Education Supervision programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former member of the studies in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not well that you don't think about it. Why the middle classes must choose their school."
Touching the interests of Spanish voters is a complex business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign stresses that "American and Latin students are less likely to graduate than white students." It is a real fact.
In order to combat these differences, the education programme of Mr Obama supports in particular, among other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
The question for Obama, however, is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that supports instruction in language classes other than English, will be his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Six Street Prep, an elementary school in the East of the Los Angeles county.
The students of this school are mostly Spanish, and from low income.
More than a third of the students, composed of many new arrivals, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% had passed the 2008 state of math, an expert level.
Similarly, nearly 93% of students have studied English-language arts
This amazing success was achieved through another ingredient that was developed by Mr Obama.
Six Street has carried out analyses, practice, ongoing evaluation of capacity, and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of the Sixth Street, this school introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total English-language immersion focused on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a great success with a student who was coming from Mexico 12 months after, if you left without his class, you wouldn't have had any chance to identify it."
"That's the way it goes, it's the way it's been for us."
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and repeat it in other schools composed of most Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its part (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its support for bilingual education, overlook the forecast of Mr. Obama's response.
Although it is favourable to the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr Obama has recently considered this question as insignificant, when he says that we must all stop complaining about the book of English law.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must ensure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that are working rather than deduce them or consider them as insignificant.
Net Cute of Petrole Follows the New Concerns of the World of Economy
Petroleum prices fell dramatically Monday because people fear that the saving plan in favour of financial markets will not be able to bring life back to the economy.
The operations at the end of the crude oil dropped by 7 percent to $99.80 in the barrel. New York Mercantile Bourgeois at the sale this morning.
Prices fell more than $20 in the last month's April.
In the past two weeks, the first material markets have been seized by Wall Street's financial assets, as well as by two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After knowing in July, an increase of $145.29 per barrel, prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, before reimbursing to the eyes of the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the rescue plan agreement, the biggest of history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been addressed by recent concerns that the crisis would be sustainable.
In the last episode of this financial disaster, "The City Group will purchase Wachovia Corporation bank operations, the government said this Monday.
At the same time, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that the frenetic negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement, did not seem to have succeeded in reviving the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rate and market exchange has become uncertain" the analysts of Deutsche Bank wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we think the first material cannot escape this contamination.
"As far as the first matter is concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand where the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
Bank analysts reduced their expectations for the next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, were thus obliged to decrease by 20 per cent, oil and gas prices by 2009.
The Festival of the Second Appointing Time for the Improvement of Team Record.
After spending the last eight months, more time than anyone in the uniform of the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets transformed a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and Cardinals also played under cloud cover.
Then the fourth back Brett Favre managed to take a walk in Laveranues Cole allowing a 12-yard touchdown, signaling a front sign of a afternoon during which their relationship made a front ring.
Favre found Cole for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, at 10 seconds of the mid-term.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all his steps to Cole.
"It's a medical player."
"We communicate very well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Cole played the cat, the defense fought the fourth back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, interviewed a lost shot and turned 32 yards up to touchdown.
Eric Smith took another step and interviewed her.
Linebacker, David Bowens lets himself escape the balloon because of Warner.
The last change, the loss of Bowens balloon, could well be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goose with a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could have marked in a while.
"The Jet's coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this follicle, said "the second time or the third time?"
When the two Jets were told to pass 21 inconsistencies in the third time, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gbrssellassie repossessed, more than his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, has again proved to be worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, after having beat his own world record at Berlin's marathon on Sunday, thus becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03 :59 of an accommodation course on the beach, Gebrssellassie fought for 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, discussed last year in Berlin.
In 35 years, Gebrselassie won the world's 26th record of his great career, during which he won the world champion or world record for any distance of 1600 metres from the marathon.
The last month, Gebrselassie had missed Beijing's Olympic Marathon, fearing that today's eyes might be too high,- that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect-timely isolated conditions, 48 degrees from the start, 55 at the arrival-Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, turned into deep runners, contributed to the decline in the marathon record for more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa wins in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie announced to the reporters that she had suffered from cramps two weeks earlier, and that she had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that his rest allowed him to remain bright, but not red.
"I'm so happy," he told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I was sent back last week, and today I have doubts; but in the end, everything is going for the best."
In Kenya, especially, the rival is African, to have more orchestrated his courses, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the books as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the meaning of competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the size of Gebrssellassie's capabilities as a core runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrsselassie after the file heads disappeared.
At a little more than three miles of arrival, Gebrselassie made its final remount to detachment from Kwambai, which ends at 2:05:36, improving its best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived the third time at 2:07:48.
In the female course, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko, surprised the world winning London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She can't participate in Beijing games because of a double hypothetical, but she promises to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It runs through a well-known strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian runners and canyans to take a good advantage, then over them about 18 miles 1⁄2 km after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ended at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, Orgueil and the Trials of the Black Road
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles away from the island, the bright and the giant Orlando, is a quiet town where the pride and complications of the African American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first city completely black to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make of our days." The city at five lakes, three shorts of crochet, 300 hair covered, 300 good nags, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival each year in Eatonville to honor Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And in a number of ways, the city described as a tourist has become a tourist through its inclusion in the tourist guide of Florida, edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project, remains a separate place.
She is also independent, dignified, and private that she was not already in the 30s, when Hurston reported that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even if this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious of foreign views.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has always lived and the oldest Parisian of the city.
"it needs to be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and battle.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of nearly 2400 people where the rate of poverty is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of black South-South rural culture - several times deflated, others acclamed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
What would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville was born with Zora, which the world here calls Hurston.
It presents its birth city throughout the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that passes through the center of Florida, often forgotten, which lies in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacity such a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passing the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school marron and white, with its gardens and these well preserved game areas, which Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells all kinds of drinks as well as everything that can be used to people of passage.
So, in spite of hundreds of words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a government car but also with analhabacy, rehabilitation, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality "did Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, say one of Johnson's young daughters, who was immortalized by Horston, reading songs without color, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She adds: "Some people didn't appreciate it."
Hurston is always remembered as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalls that Hurston came from the city without warning, on the side of a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, traditional customs are high.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told me, while many were moved by it.
"people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he added, balancing himself in his chair of the post-patio that he gave on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was a literate star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman in the Barnard College of the 20s, she was buried in a grave somewhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there is no big memory, no record for the big audience.
I don't think they understood the contribution or inheritance it offered to the world " declared Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography published in 2003 by Hurston.
A crucial moment emerges in the 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted to take a road to five streets in town to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main street on two roads in the community.
The development of Orlando has already moved Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville had just returned from a difficult period of his history.
A strong integration, among so many other things, has resulted in the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mix of races led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At this time, a band of white young people were going to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady is even lost."
They're running a pasta from their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the appeal of the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" an insult rather than a glorification of my race."
Residents now declare that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has intensified the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened the confidence of young people.
"The black children had the custom of being dressed - I remind them well - our master would wake up in the morning and in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, and director of the Eatonville Community Security Watch, a non-profit group.
This lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You wouldn't hide your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Melle Nathiri.
Civil rights, in addition, have created space for other black Zora Neale Hurston-writers, actors and artists who are also involved in the damage, such as her, armed with a happy self-confidence and conduct lines such as: "How can they be deprived of my company's pleasure?"
It's over me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went back to the anonymous tomb of Horston and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an abbreviated biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, re-entered it to American cannons.
The car project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous daughter had found her way back.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider it a rescuer.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the disastrous consequences of this road.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many came back in January to celebrate it.
After many years, the content resumed the proposal of the car.
"The failure of the car on five roads, extremely fast, a real civil height," said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summarized the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the autoroute project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been frequenting our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (also known as Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, reopened.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be seen as a back road on a summer rain day, as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today accounts for 90 percent of black)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, their reason for being, are still treated with caution.
It is necessary to request permission for most interviews, and some things - such as the walls of Eatonville's old church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the camps - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Melle Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for the living red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, in view of the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is rising.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston to consider his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, not better or worse, but also fair, creative, bossy, popular and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is well for the sincere civil love that we hear in the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, aged 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or the police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old winters of Winter Park, it seems that you have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who go through this area will think, "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others," said Alondra Kenon after the last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to record the story, it is a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone talks financially.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kitchen and the fine TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cycle.
They could never think that in the wine and bee offices above their head, bankers and cover managers who monopolize New York, have been working the worst "workday at the office" since the crack of 1929.
The bookers continue to hang on the trunks, with their chariotas and muffin plates for the morning meetings.
The Latinos continue to walk among the residential furniture carrying, like women, a fifty luxurious shirts attached to a jaguar on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to cook to buy their morning sandwich for the ambulances, and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 19 h per week.
I didn't feel the crisis despite the completely pessimistic news until this afternoon when I decided to open up a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work late afternoon because I found out at my local JP Morgan Chase's office, a dozen people who were making the call.
Not in front of the cashier's cookies, nor in order to remove the species or make a sale, but in front of the customer's service ticket, where the usual customers ordered their tickets, the tourists asked for guidance for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd learn later from Starr, my "authorised personal banker", were all crying for the same reason that I did.
Not in the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from the accounts of so-called truffles (i.e. a construction company), credit associations, and the type of local savings caches and their branches that operate only in a state, and who claim to treat clients as their family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327, made use of the bankruptcy union, and while New Yorkers returned home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, to the savings accounts of a $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store staff who are in front of me, exposed to another potential loss, transferred their money to a bank that they seem reliable, or the one who makes the most of the rescue in Wall Street.
Some New Yorkians have become very familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my Chinese local supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and her mayor, Director-General Dick Full, with the same familiarity that she could have to criticize a colleague.
And Lynn, the construction of my furniture, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetables.
She said, after my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Muslim drums buried while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and, Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, participates in a demonstration to present the "Chiefs Against Islam" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry road panels depicting red-ray moustaches.
The Police accuses extremists of having won an Austrian Muslim summit, the weekend of the victory of the political parties of extreme rights to the country's general elections.
More than 90 graveyards were seriously damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, of an organized action.
Criminals have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; detectives think it could have been done to remove the feeling of hatred of extremists from Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be in some way linked to the elections.
A voice from the Islamic local community declared to be "profoundly shocked" in the announcement of this profession, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that reaches its end.
Austria seriously intends to find her courage, following her oscillation to the right in parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two parties of extreme right who voted almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, launched an anti-immigrant campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, launched his campaign against the port of folkland and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to food there.
During his final course in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the mountains of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of museums and mines, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses conducted just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, which is shown by the majority of young voters who have made the difference because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is forbidden to travel abroad.
The courts prohibited the glamour rock, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuses on children, of expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing their intention to return to Spain by France.
The Kent Police had granted this ban to travel last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse on children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at Ashford's limited courts, but was represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman stated "on Thursday 25 September at Ashford, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't here then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving him registered in the list of sexual abuse charges.
It must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may be punished for up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said that it would not discuss any particular cases or potential transfers of Glitter in the content.
"Kent's police will do whatever it takes to protect our children as strangers."
"We think it is easier to monitor someone who lives in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"protecting Kent's inhabitants is the most dearest intention to the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks for the public."
. Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, 10 and 11 years of age, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he had to sail for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him to control passports, and finally he went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities denied him entry into their territory, so he was forced to return to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow's airport on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge, West London, for him to be registered in the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as requested by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for the arrest of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was satisfied and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from moving to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photograph
No pants, no eternal clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free of all tensions to obtain the desired aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, at these times unknown to the great public, where we discover hidden gestures and scenes from artists who are not interested in mounting on stage.
The German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco - people" the theatre of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with this least known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer repeats the special iconography of flamenco under different English.
Even in the programming of the month of Flamande Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater each day," explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that this is not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of passing on stage of passion, sadness, joy ... arresting the public.
To capture these artists' personality moments, you don't have to take photos on stage.
They have a personality and a pure character.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera photos of the personages of the stars of flamenco ".
With the "People's Chant des Mines", Bauer started a long trip to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of photo and material, remember classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and survives every day".
It is not about the dance or song itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that has been presented here in the El Fotomata Gallery.
Flamenco views such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty-ten photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "SportARTproject".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and can enter into their lives for a longer or less time.
I think the portrait in the photograph is the most difficult kind.
You're facing people, people you don't sometimes know or who just leave you for a few minutes to make a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is presented at the El Fotomata Gallery, located at the 20th Street of the Mata (e.g. in the Hercule People's Republic) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he wrote is "true audacity"
The novel is located in places where no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is very determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for twenty years and has been through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday confessed to the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently deals with it "is a true audacity" and that "all proves he shouldn't write it."
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his intervention at the exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days he saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people in the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected person of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of Hay Festival to the majority of the voices of the participants, made the theater with Juan Bravo.
The representative of the Festival, Félix Romeo, met with a fascinating audience who had not seen the past time during which Peru, with a prodigious memory and a large dose of humor, withdrew the birth of its literary vocabulary, which is due to "his dream of reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote a "very methodical way" through an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his "inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his speech and his memories inspired his novels.
Hispano-American novelist recognized that "there is no means" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure taste, an epileptic experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "have effects" and "remains less like people", because it was asked the writers "do not let yourself go to the frivolity" and take their vocation.
The Bad Times Break the Pozoblanco Fair
The banding party that ended the bulls races in the Pozoblanco field was suspended this morning, after the horse-traffickers had checked that the arrene was ineffective.
In this way, the Committee of the Organization, in accordance with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the tour course.
The bad time was found on this farm, because at last two parties on three could not be located.
Saturday is the rain that prevented the celebration of the second stage of planned bulls.
On the show, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Baptista, who had to face in the castle of Castilblanco.
So only Friday's party was in place
On Friday, the winemaker was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was brought to the triumph, after having made his arms movements face the tower with joy and aesthetics.
The same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the roof of the tower and a cut ear that the discovered gradients praised more than his fight against the tower himself.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the ranks of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second pillar, after a much better fight, he became famous by most of the public.
Police control of a fireplace in the province of Alava: two thousand kilograms of hachisch found
At least 10 o'clock in the morning.
Control of the movement of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune d'Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two officers of a firefighter and the two of them run away.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hachisch, is to stop them.
The police continued and arrested one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information published by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit took control of vehicles on N-1 at the border of the Armenian Community.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver broke the orders, broke down, and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two miles farther on the ground, where the two employees were down to escape in a forested area.
The bass police finally arrested one of the two employees and obtained the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch that they were transporting and that they found after inspecting the supplies, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch ballasts. Then they transferred it to a police post for an ex-exhaustive inspection and for drug weighing.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not match that letter on the grey card of the supplier, that is why they also accused the arrest of a falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to stop the other suspect, who has succeeded in getting involved and to determine the source of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old arrester, A. A.J., has been watched to achieve the different stages and will be judged within the following hours.
The actress Heather Locklear is arrested for taking a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) to conduct a drug.
A witness saw him perform strange maneuvers by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, after a spokesman from the California police patrol opened up to the People's magazine.
The witness explained that at 1630, Locklear "supported the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get out of the garage, and going back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Not long after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopped in the middle of the car and left his vehicle.
This person, right now, called the emergency services because "she was concerned about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It had a deorientated air," that is why the agents led it to a drug and alcohol centre to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed cooperativeness and alcohol abuse has been eliminated since the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we think Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested suspected of having conducted under the influence of a substance not specified and was imprisoned at 19 a.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was out of Arizona's clinic where she was pregnant to take care of a nervous depression.
Callers asked the Union's Andalustic Federation to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator-in-Office of the Union, Gaspar Llamzares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Counsellor of the Youth and Sports of the Municipalities of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was released last week after being accused of having been charged with the treatment of his family.
"In this case, I am very federal, and this will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the political party's behaviour that he should adopt within Séville's municipal council.
However, the leader of the Union Gouche requested that the investigations prove "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Union Gouche has always defended this kind of business in order to have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party had "the very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Sangre de Mayo," the Garci osé
In inspiration of the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recruited the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Sangre de Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his film with about 15 million euros of budget.
The cinematist tried to "scant the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous Romance, he explained today during the film presentation, with Kim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film for more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de Mayo" will make its exit in the next Friday cinema rooms, which will then become a television series for Telemedrid more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci ensures that with this tournament "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years ago, was charged with making a memorial film for the two hundred years of May 2, which he always accepted when the story was in the national history.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Community constitute a "only opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the environment of a Spanish who was a leader in the fight, as the struggle for independence led the people to rebel under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the cinema is sorry that he has not received funding as for the movies "Captaine Alatriste" or "Goya ghosts" - more than twice as much of the one received for "Mayo Blood," - because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, who worked with him during almost all his career.
The film "Return to Start" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he used to repeat before starting the tournament and to whom he didn't do castting, because it seems to him "humbled" and he thinks that "the role of the film is to go to the theater and cinema to keep himself informed".
A lot of actors in "Mayo Song" repeat themselves in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, and Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four times a candidate to Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidates who represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de Mayo", "Seven French billiard tables" and finally the winemaker, "The blind tourrs," are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which should be better known," he said.
This Garci movie doesn't wait for a price.
"You start to think that you work for posterity, then you realize that your work is only for prosperity, and now you're happy to make a movie more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón is put in the skin of the sevillen dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillen dancer will give honor to a sevillen dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and an analous mother (Gorgina Valencia Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in Triana district and who, at the age of three, was angry with her family in London.
It was a dance of free and specialist dances of Eastern dances.
She had a passionate life, a pioneer for the liberation of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and crying for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe of the two-year-olds, made Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and this last one suggested that I interpret the Sevillen Dance Tortola Valencia and that seemed incredible to me."
According to the dance, "we're not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the papillo" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" to some tangos.
His dance was sexual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to the bed," she said.
The scene was made with two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabella again in one of his shows, as he had done to "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilda Coral, who was extremely interested in cooperating with the student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature person.
I am happy that she has agreed to play a role in my work and that I am honored."
The scene was also presented through the musical composition and guitars of Jesus Torres y Paco Ariaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the persecutions of El Pájaro, as well as the violence of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal partner of this kind of artists who were considered to be divine."
This work also relates, in some ways, to the life of this woman who has lived in places so far, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was usually in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think these are women who have a great influence in their time and now no one knows and appreciates their work," said Bayón.
The show will begin at 20 a.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married poet" in the church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, was included in the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalousie to celebrate the " Trinidad Zenobia and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the " Trinity Zenobia and Juan Ramón " comes to its end with the restoration of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum, and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This lighthouse" which was inaugurated in May and who, after traveling in the different Andalous provinces, went to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Taberenro and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Encisso, to continue the work of one of the most well-known poets.
America requests less without Paul Newman
"From time to time God created perfect humans
Paul Newman was a party."
This phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in the "Absence of Malice," and well illustrates the disappointment of American cinema, and of all America, facing the striking idea that Newman is no more than this world.
I've had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a tough cut for the whole world.
"Sometimes a feeling exceeds all expression, and now I lost a big friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the parents of the film and the patriot has died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and bourgeois markets are afraid, the US's appreciation has fallen very low, desperate for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, it remains to be human beings but to admire and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It was an ideal of beauty and truth for all the world.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and vaccinated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in the honour of his nephew who died after a overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country who had the burden of fighting against a suicidal food culture.
This expanding vogue of admiration was home to Hollywood without paying attention to nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the summit of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, was able to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"We have placed the high bar," observed George Clooney, who may be the only one today who is trying to track the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious and far-reaching private life.
This is not always easy or possible in the media jungle of our day.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for five years, to whom he was loyal even if his opportunities did not go away.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a biffet in my fridge?" he had the habit of enjoying it.
In heaven, he is proud to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"From all the great roles that he has played, he has never been so proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring father and a philanthropist," he says.
Madrid at the 2016 Olympics event
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the fall in 2012, that could happen in 2016.
But you're asking me if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's course: we're not!
They call it the perfect course, but I think it was the worst course I've ever attended.
If they had taken into account all the errors encountered during the course, they would have been the subject of an elimination note.
But let's examine everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the withdrawal of the folders, which makes you want to move forward.
That's not bad, but if they're trying to move you, it would be better than they give you everything (including the e-mail for the courses).
And it's not.
They only made you go there to take the dosard (first mistake, move only for it) and (after a long delay) surprise!, there was only the size 'S ' for the mail (second error, because I need an XL size)
In what world are we living?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small-sized mails with less fabric and less expensive cuts?
Well, that's nothing about what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that there must be very soon to remove the electronic spot, the waiting file is 15 minutes and, moreover, you need to leave your bag at two in the entrance.
The waiting period lasted more than 35 minutes, which is unclear as 11,000 people are expected for these courses.
Since there was a long waiting file, the competitions started and we haven't left our bag twice to the entrance, although once in fact, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting for more than 40 minutes during which there were rebels and bartenders.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be included in the classification with the exact time, because of the noise they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect course, that would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the J.O. 2016.
Microsoft searches for a recipe (virtual)
At the Microsoft MIT Emergency Technologies conference a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a species of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but is able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft case, a ship to move into the company's fields) in response to what was requested during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, which they are - including remembering which places they are occupying - and listening and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she realizes that she does not belong to the group that is currently talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asked him if she was here to visit someone and she told him she'd answer him in a few moments.
All of this without a blue screen.
That's impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we discussed more than a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and there will be no more associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would be five times faster.
This is a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extra" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft's reason for losing its operating system is important, but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first turn of Google to compete with Windows.
A number of people have just pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operational system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for the information and software to be understood.
He assumes the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
He will never disappear, but he must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
That week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system but more to the Internet browser.
The computer is only assigned to turn Firefox, Explore or Chrome and people spend more time on the Internet than they can walk through windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to have fewer applications, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less complicated, less complicated.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they can finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, in fact, and I'll show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of the spare rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the wine distributor, a display asks them to use their own research tool - "Our research. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not appear at the beginning of 2009 but until the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is delayed and the iPhone is already on the market, which will cost them.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso brought him on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio brought him one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Parrain ' of Francis Ford Coppola' and became part of the association of the muscles.
And if we were to enumerate all its appearances, we could also mention this musutachu suit that raised weights in an ambulatory circle.
It's not just a simple piece of human flesh in cotton, moving and without defects.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Brussels distinguishes from all others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known under the name of 'Marcel' - who has to see with the sport because he takes the name, according to legend, of the poet Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
' Marcel ' distinguishes others by his excellent cotton, by his unique cut, by his distinctive logo and by the little Belgian (recognisable pain) that the best-known body mails have in the cup.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not produce only tanks tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cassette cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Habits designed for the comfort of substations.
Even if it's bad to wear them just like undercovers.
They've got too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me."
His huge appearance with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take very seriously their new activity in the fashion.
According to Monica, they are only beautiful and famous girls who give their names.
It was presented to the promotion of the Mango brand in Paris at its new social headquarters but also to the presentation of prices of the most important fashion than the sponsoric Spanish house.
Monica's warm and scared.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to introduce the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new independent winter season, but also to assist in the presentation of the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in the honour of Valentino.
A very intense day, but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The 50s and 60s film fills us and inspires us very much for our collections.
I love swimming in the city and watching women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dance, actress and designer, you're a very popular woman, aren't you?
I think it is, but in the end, it is all connected and these activities have many things in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look at my aunt's clothes and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way to dress.
The dancers love to dress well for the courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actresses, when you wear clothes is at this point where you really put yourself in the person's skin.
At least it's all connected.
You haven't been there for 30 years. Has that been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, I've been happy for 30 years.
I find that the woman is smarter, more experienced, and more happy with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done everything I've wanted to do since I was young and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're becoming a mother?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body is asking me for it and, more importantly, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I don't care.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of joy and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movie, you're waiting for the different films that you turned last year to come out.
It's true, I hated them coming out.
I'm a woman out of the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, and I'd love to have everything now, but of course that's not possible.
I hated the films 'The Last Time' and 'A Search for Christ'.
To see what you're thinking...
A few days ago you started on the passerella with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't you see that!
I'm not mounted on the passport to make the manoeuvre.
Simply, Naomi Campbell has called me, I know it from time to time, to invite me to participate in London to a charity stand for her association in favour of the support of women and the clothing we show - I have displayed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold to collect money from Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a person in the heart of her.
They say so many things about her, I know it, many things aren't true.
Plus, that's the good side of Naomi.
She asked me to defend myself for such a noble cause, but if she asked me to make the dust, I would have done it at the same time.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol relapsers in flight will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wanted the driver who had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol abuse to install in his vehicle a system that would prevent the vehicle from running as a vehicle, or if he did not suffer.
The initiative was already announced in the last month of June and now appears in the Minister of State's report in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by proposing road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety, but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of the Vehicle, will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of car drivers arrested for driving more than once in a state of accident are driving the car.
Alkolock would avoid this because it is a vehicle-based system that measures the alcohol rate in the hall and prevents the vehicle from running if the driver does not suffer before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the authorised one.
It costs more than EUR 1,000 and is in charge of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in 2007 in the United States showed that vehicles equipped with this device would reduce to 65 per cent of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is thought that this could save life to 115 people every year.
This measure refers only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but the reform by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental title.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote for an initiative by the Spanish socialist party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40 p.m., the scheduled official hours of the Spanish Air Force, in which the Asturias Princesses were travelling to the Presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the side of the sky, but its rays still required that it put its hand in a mirror so that it could see the king's couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the scale, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked in the street, at the taxi driver, if it was the time when the Spanish princesses visited the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, very well, we can't go to the airport to take customers at this hour... are you here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here for two years thinking.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princesses of Asturias and knows the importance of travel.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red tape and a military line composed of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and clothed with sea blue, the Princess, when she, with her hair in the wind, is very dressed and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told him that a prayer was threatening.
They make a brief stop to photographers before passing through the room where the official cortage awaits them.
At the hotel door where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a regular Mexican TV journalist awaits them.
The highest price for the mode
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no designer living more extraordinary and good than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new fashion talent.
The winemaker will be rewarded by a EUR 300,000 price.
Hier Sandrina Fasoli, Belgium came out of the first edition, looked at its models in Mango wine at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and it was almost emotive.
Of course it is the second largest brand store in Europe that has just been opened with 1.335 square metres of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the wish to thank Stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us back in a lovely dinner at the Garnier opera in Paris.
As a table near that of the Chagals extraordinary family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and doing against the evil good heart, due to the recent death of his brother, Nati made a dress of Mango and a few pairs of ELAH, who cut the breath, and arms, hands down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared for her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil finished the night without clothing because they had hired them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who was present in the store with a pants and a shirt - from her own collection - and who for dinner was metamorphosisd by wearing a long and black dress, was exaggerated during the night's visit to the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballroom repertoires room and reminded us of the good old time, she got one of the bars and she managed a big bed.
Ines Sastre is not left for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us first on her mobile phone pictures of her son's son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez, another fine man moving on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel of Paris, with his crew, his servants and asking the predecessor, that he had no honour in his room.
From the stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, anti-stress number
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to cover all, they are all repertoires in a book that will bring relief to the librarians on September 30.
The morning morning awakens us almost every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's worse when we think of the rapid activity that imposes on us the present life.
The office is synonymous of tension and the computer of pain at two.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and the problems associated with the world of work.
But it's 1001, not one more or one less.
In addition to the Yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book all a 'menu' of methods adapted to taste and time for each.
The anti-Strengthening work is aimed at 1001 ways to stop and will come directly to the libraries of editors Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is impossible to find peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' is such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that help you stop.
If the adrenaline is not short in your vision to restore the balance of your body and if stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit down in the couch, relax your mind and focus on reading.
Talk to and sleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not report to those who are very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but in fact it doesn't matter.
It is a blessed alternative to the dream that is called dreamilocchie.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course there's more than one talking during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (one time in life, for example, associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodicly (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child is no longer remembered.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often associated with other changes in sleep patterns such as nightmares, nightmares, night sweaters, or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very strong, stressful, or surrogate situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it is produced is also very variable.
He may speak with a little quiet voice, with isolated words, mumbles or otherwise with crises, tears, long speeches ...
In the case where sleep is very frequent, it would be fair to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to obtain an explanation of the problem.
We said that it is a blessing alternative, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another alteration of sleep which can be cared for (for example, if it is related to a sleep disorder or stress).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exaggerate the child before going to bed.
Therefore, search for quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have to quit, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful smile.
As soon as dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will remember nothing more than what happened.
Practical Tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he's talking, it's okay.
Remember, if you are very upset several times, it is recommended that you consult a doctor or check out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not common), do not try to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because while you're sleeping, it's not conscious to be able to organize your thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not pay attention to what he is dreaming, from the point of view of how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even saying good-bye.
That causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illustrative...
Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory on his land after a long period of dissipation.
Without a big match, Jaunes and Noirs created the largest number of opportunities and succeeded in transforming it into one for the win of the match.
The rhythm was not very supportive during this meeting where the attackers were in trouble to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the Captain Kauffmann who was watching the truck on a distant exit, Illhaeusern was going to take the climber and turn to the long Fenderflick tour, then with Hirn above, Roman of the foot's top or yet Diebold came to defeat Dannemarie's defense.
In the face, there was a block in the middle of the ground and just left Rihai back at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second half-time will be determined with two signs of Rihai and Temporal for Denmark, and shortly after the opening of the score for the Illhouseians by Marais, well placed to take a ball on a first attempt by Godbold (53e').
But the Illhouseens Butter will not be able to satisfy its long-term happiness and it will be forced to rehabilitate the clothingers a dozen minutes later and leave its crew in numerically lower.
But Dannemarie will not be able to benefit and will not pose major problems to an Illhusian One who just picked up a bit to "compete" his defense, broken into all the last seconds of the game where, after a big casing, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy at the meeting of angry fishermen
Before calling for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a tour of Britain.
In view of the demonstration of the strength of fishermen who were strongly disturbed by the access of several flag doors and norms, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures to address the price of the gas, which has reached a record of more than €1.14 per litre per medium.
According to Elysée David Martin, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses find competitiveness and secure the conditions of employment and compensation of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out unloading operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, offering close to 10 km of doors.
The happy port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Island were not stopped.
A filtering barrier has been launched on the island of Quiberon.
The seas have already shown their determination to burn, from the bottom, pines and pallets in front of the warehouses of the Brest gates, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was extended to other ports from the Atlantic and the Manche, such as the Olonne Sabels, in Vendée, where the chaltiers remained at which, or at Havre, where twenty ships blocked the movements of trade vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped at night the block of the important Total Refinery of Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the Ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its continuing participation in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, who did not support their movement.
"The famine will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "does not want to move to Paris," for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that a boat's profit-effective threshold is only reached with a gas of less than EUR 0,30.
Paul Newman the great
The incredible interpreter of "Butt Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and the engaged actor, Paul Newman, who was 83 years old.
Embracer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft has delivered 215 aircraft this year despite the threats of recession on the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 delivered equipment, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, his president.
In the first half, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for his range planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15 per cent of its assets
The U.S. International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have reflected, plans to allocate more than 15 per cent of its assets to reimburse the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international policy and its withdrawal activities to the United States, namely the journal that mentions close sources of the document.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met in the evening to consider possible delays, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp airline, its 59 per cent share in the Transatlantic Holdings Reassurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these issues, followed by the FT.
AIG must quickly make liquidity payments in order to compensate for the loan of 85 billion which it has authorized the Federal Reserve to take 80 per cent of its capital from the US authorities, which is twice the share of the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Station accused a historical fall following the rejection by the Chamber of Representatives of the Paulson Banks Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 per cent, or a loss of sight approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14 per cent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) extended from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most severe loss of its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the date of the withdrawal of trade after terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, technological dominant, passed 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the standard size index & Poor's 500 8.81% (or 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street was founded after the unexpected refusal by the Chamber of Representatives of the Banks Rescue Plan, which should provide some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, the representatives refused to the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the means he requested.
Nearly two republics of three have rejected its plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows where the market was concerned about this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will not happen "too late".
"If the project is actually murdering (...) then the reconciliation will be passed quickly to the Fed (the Central Bank of America, etc.) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would increase the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And increasing the sense of urgency, "every day leading to the loss of a financial institution" in the United States, she stressed Ms. Piegza.
Following the failure of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the capture of Wachovia’s banking activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has been rapidly accelerated, leading to emergency banking interventions in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets face "not just an American crisis but a global crisis", the FTN analyst added.
The compulsory market has increased strongly.
The performance of the ten-year-old Treasury was 3,632%, versus 3,827% Friday evening, and that at 30-year-old 4,161%, against 4,357% of the guard.
Obama, winner of the first TV doll
At the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, another came to know who, John McCain or Barack Obama brought it.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democrat QGs declared their own victory in this television drama that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though honorable, was not "birth" enough to allow him to bring his down in the presidential polls for five weeks.
The Gallup Institute, with a published opinion survey published on Saturday, gives five points to Obama (49% to 44% to McCain), believes that it was the Democrat who took his lead in the game.
Of the Indian voters, who are those who count, Obama has come out for 39% of the probes, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the expected good performance of his co-legislator, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"That would be an error of the underestimater.
She's got good instincts," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The Septuagint McCain had not stopped putting forward his indisputable foreign policy experience, while stressing the “naïveness” of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senior Obama doesn't seem to understand but..." he accused several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also said.
An attack angle marked yesterday in public television publications.
Obama stressed to him that he was the future.
Without showing up, he showed himself discreet and precise.
He has advanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States to the world.
"McCain has not always understood, while Obama, yes," he said, this weekend, a democratic spot reproducible to the Republican that he has not taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American street".
"For the four-and-a-half minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he said Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a fighting rain.
He did not even utter the words "meaning class" or "employers." The financial delay clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most appropriate to save the economy on the front of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive turnout," he thought yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder from Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current decline "is the final outcome of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that even if 95 per cent of American taxes could be reduced despite Wall Street's surpluses, the Illinois senator also noted that the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations from here to 2030.
In fact, the two candidates failed to raise questions regarding the financial saving plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely imputable.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was a choice, you?"
Young people and opposers appeared on the main part of the Belarusian capital on Sunday morning to reject the results of the legislation.
Several hundred of Biéloruses met on Sunday at the closing of the polling offices on the central part of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to express themselves against President Alexandre Loukachenko's authority: "the dictator, resignation".
Some people claim they haven't even voted, "Well, because they'll do what they want from my voice," said a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has done so represents foreign observers in order to regain language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the gel of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers.
They have not been against him.
"We have been held apart from electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the deposition," Iouri Potemkine, the Union's spokesman for the Democratic Forces, said a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, points out Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the President of 2006 and head of the European movement file, because the important thing is that the voices are, and in us, it is the executive power.
If opposition members enter Parliament, they will be appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament may mean space on television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which is deeply rooted in Russia, is seen in the crisis, and we are not reformed, we are at risk of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition feared that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who followed the electoral process would not acknowledge the validity of the polling.
It points out that the participation figures are too high, and that the generalization of the vote by precipitation (26 per cent of the electors in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations.
"Did you notice that there was a election, you? asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the voting offices.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those best qualified."
The silence of the night goes back on the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The interview - You're safe from blood.
Hema-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, as Hema-Québec became one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he recognized the confidence of the public that had been seriously exploited by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (VIH) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the horror of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada set up a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur again.
While Judge Krever was late to deposit his report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Ghelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Quebec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began his activities, 38 per cent of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary is recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground over the years that followed, we renewed the public's confidence," she said, before sincerely affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 per cent of the Quebecese population had now confidence in Héma-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At this time, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease was seen in Europe in the exclusion of many cases of the human form of the disease of the foothills, which has been strong since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know of all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then supported by one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, which, when we do not know it and that a serious disease can cause, in the event of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneracy of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are imposed.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of people who had been resident in the United Kingdom for more than a month has been denied since 1980.
But a few years ago, he was shown beyond any doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode has thus shown us that the precautionary principle that we have applied has meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: nuclear acid tests (TAN) that enable donors to detect directly in their blood the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests were used so far.
TANs have allowed the mutate period, which extends between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
It has thus substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV - contaminated blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a HIV transmission event occurs by a blood product.
I think it can be felt today that it is easy to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Quebec's head.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, at the time of the invasion of the West Nile virus, was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly monitored," continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that more than a security supply, Héma-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies.
"The needs are increasing because the elderly population is growing.
Anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donors network, which does not include only 3 per cent of the Quebecs eligible for the blood gift."
Everyone in health, 18 years of age, and more responsive to the eligibility criteria can, however, give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where they are free from malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The pendulums are very rare.
But the members of this donor network need to be renewed as they grow older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them and urge them to become regular donors.
Life today is so busy, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving her blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone gloves, heart valves, eyeglasses, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen before being placed in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The ombular cord, which was considered a biomedical waste of rich blood cells, can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We have celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousands of blood samples and are scheduled to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start to propose it for greefs at the beginning of the next year," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of blood clotting as very popular.
"Many mothers are denied access," because Hema-Québec has no means to propose this complex and cost-effective program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Semi-final Impact
The impact of Montreal has been qualified for the semi-final round of the final series of the first SSL division, thanks to a 3-1 winner (4-3 in total goals) at the costs of Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series to the total goals, in the Saputo Stadium.
The field environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first tenth without purpose from one side to the other, the ground environment of David Testo and Rocco Plantenino marked the other layers of the exhibitional training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to enjoy Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
We recall that during the first game of the series of return, Friday, the Impact had a 2-1 defect in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder compiled a 3-1 deficit in the game back to import it 4-3, but the Whitecaps have all the same access to the semi-final round 5-4 in total of the goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
A Brief - But Victory for Kovalev
The third number one of Canada is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Pkelanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a Canadian 3-2 prize against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec has collected two aids, and Kovalev has taken a step in this race, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only purpose of the rifle.
"I'm not ready yet, has prevented Russia.
I need another match to feel at ease."
"He tried too much to do in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a great ovulation."
Charrest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
After the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest arrived yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) tried to make an election on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Resume the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest has presented with visual force still on the big lines, at the end of the Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Later, during his speech, he was designed a kind of Moulin in images.
There were three huge screens on the screens of the exhibitions of hydroelectric barriers, mining operations, from Quebec, seen by Google Maps, cards, etc.
Large means such as electoral periods.
In the press, the Prime Minister also refused to exclude the election from this automation, even though he noted that his time was very busy.
"Plan Nord" is the fourth bread of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on working with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the first Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - had never been made for a presentation.
However, the prime minister was forced to explain why the North was “a great joy to the potential” but did not give up on investment amounts, or a specific priority in future projects.
As a result, there may be a number of advantages to what could be developed more: hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, due to the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "field twice as big as France", "is with us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it with us, but it is with us," he insisted, as well as to show that he sought a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he highlighted: the road to gold in Abitibi, the Quebecian engineering, the Bay James.
"It's for us, it's our future," he added, after having taken a theatre break to observe the huge map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of the Quebec territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, explained the prime minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have rejected.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the Government," he said.
In the rest, "with climate change, we have to reconsider our view of the North," he said, referring to the passage of the north-west, which will open all year due to the source of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that the occupation of the territory is a duty.
And the people of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly the Pequist Member of Ungava), have already begun consultations with 30 communities.
A inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has a significant place to work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "confirmed, ordered and respected by the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of the first liberal ministers who had done so.
"Like the liberals before us, we thought otherwise to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the current themes at the end of the week, which was intended to be sold by a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed that the Beauharnois Centre be rebaptized in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bouursa, who made the Bay James, our part has forgotten the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press release, he called for another reference, a conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric barrier project, Mr. Charrest stressed that his service was scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I intend to be there," he entrusted his warriors, raising them with food greetings.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that he would not have a election in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not remove the possibility of withdrawing this automatic clause, as permitted by the law.
He points out, however, that his time is filled, especially by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
At the end of the week, the General Council provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including the "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a post letter: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto right on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, large lines of the North Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
The Pakistani chief, Pauline Marois, urged the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry Government had launched in 2001.
According to it, the Liberian Government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have been more advanced today" Ms. Marois commented on her candidate's side in Jean-Talon (scrutin who is present today), Françoise Mercure.
The DQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, instead of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dedicated Country
This is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (ironie) in Harper's office, which allowed the last summer to say from Louise Arbour that it was a "honest" for Canada.
This is how the challenge of this woman who has fought an intense struggle for justice and who deserves all of our admiration is as long as the prime minister's admiration and Stephen Harper himself.
We are looking forward to a government that is the only one, including all the Western countries involved, to not repatriate its nursery in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the facts that he was denied.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, rewords its word and lets a child soldier cross in human terms.
The only one who submits to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, the International Amnesty and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, apply for Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it doesn't matter whether a young adult is now mentally destroyed, no doubt after so many years of action.
We are still not aware of it, but we are now assisting in an insinuating erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper does not cease to smile and sings if he believes in his mouth.
This is the time when no morality can be found: we can bring down, torture, arbitraryly imprisoning a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a government leader until now (if it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a part that violates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see this government decline to what was done with the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this rebirth, and not anymore.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwellian discourses
In his edition of September 17, the Debor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian miner Barrick Gold.
According to an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has attempted a continuation of six million disfaminate against three authors and a small publishing house without the floor in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, that is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions, but the law.
Unhappily, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would it be to go to ruin anyone or to support a position contrary to the sign?
No matter how much the trial is done, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada should spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and to fight, in very insignificant weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by nearly unfunded mines.
The tactic, in these inequitable struggles, is often to destroy the defenders in order to impose a regulation on the friendly, which will slow the opposition further and discourage anyone who thinks again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that she had to present her vision of facts.
In contrast to what is done in many countries where Barrick Gold works, Canada's debates are usually due to exchange of ideas and not to abstinence.
Therefore, it was sufficient to open its books, records and establish a genuine debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to rely on public opinion and rejects requests and letters of support to the authors of North Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could sometimes ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to the fatly paid lawyers and not to the entire Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even dictators have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and editors of North Canada does it first because it rejects the brutal way of mine.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many consider to be a baillon follow-up (for the "public debate", Barrick Gold has come to place a permanent position in the place of the authors of Northern Canada who intend to stop the use of this term...).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surprise speech, Barrick Gold's follow-up is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the question of truth, essential to all democratic society.
It does not, in bloc, the right to call for credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that move the world's rich business into a country like Canada, in the face of repeated repetition, what can be done?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of North Canada.
She has a right to appeal.
The university environment, which we belong to, has long been known to manage debate and disagreement and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's determined follow-up clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no wish for a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the heads of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the greatest economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the U.S. $700 billion plan to bridge the financial crisis that hit Wall Street for months must still be filled with the two rooms of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the elections of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public funds, new provisions to contain the number of houses occupied for default payment, as well as a right to review the salaries paid to the managers of the insurance companies.
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes later this morning, at the end of a two-day negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been done to open up the real economy and the ordinary Americans of the crisis in Wall Street," the democracy explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do that, the trauma, chaos and confusion about the daily life of the Americans will be enormous," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned to sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that would cause a new gap on investors' humor.
The limited time given was the opening of the markets this morning.
In association with the negotiations, the two candidates at the American presidential election were shown rather favourable to the agreement, however not to express their satisfaction that they were obliged to reach that end.
Democrat Senator Barack Obama has been awarded the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including those aimed at allowing owners to maintain their home and the salary of the directors of the companies recovered from the State.
"When the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibility of some, there is no cause for rejoicing.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked about another chain to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The great lines I've read [shows] that it's something that we all have to say and with which we can advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with the money of taxpayers the suspicious, risk-active and inexplicable credit of the US financial institutions.
It is after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the excavation of a real estate bubble that has initially led to the collapse of mortgage credit (substantiated) before extending to other more recent forms of credit securities (PCAA) and decommissioning on a balance sheet and on the decline of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican elected members who had managed the first draft agreement, last week.
It is believed to be the result of this failure since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are guaranteed only by the government, rather than by purchases.
In order to round up the English for the world at Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to take up losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover.
The new plan provides for the sale of a first fine of 250 billion which may be added to 100 billion other if the President is required.
Another vote of the Congress should be taken by 350 billion others.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will receive participation in the subsidiary companies that will benefit from dividends in the event of profit and will be able to repay it when the tour is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the settlement procedures for housing related to the real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and departure compensation paid to the managers of the affected enterprises.
The architects of the plan would like to see it under the vote of the House of Representatives today and of the Senate Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have green fire.
In effect, votes continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the republican and Democrat camps.
"Of course, Washington doesn't understand you," said the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Commission, at the address of his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one who is responsible for the benefit of taxpayers."
An animator of a small group at Congress called "the caucus of sceptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred outstanding economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to press and carefully examine the way to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was a new evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three countries of Benélux announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas informed it that it had declined to acquire its full shipping competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the US real estate loan crisis.
Strongly employs 85 000 people and is part of twenty-great European banks and ten larger insurance companies.
"It's not money lost, said the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wooter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, a right of vote will be recovered from the bank and from the influence.
It's just something that savings and households appreciate now that time is uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other hand, the British Government seemed to be able to nationalize another bank that was damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take into account the entire current loans in Bradford and Bringley bank, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was the one who would buy the subsidiaries and customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon engaged
His beauty in the eyes of gold was long his whole card, and no one would say his weakness.
Was he released from the Narcissian mirror, the American actor in the charmer's sleep?
Yes, and no.
His power, his sensitivity, and a talent that came from the source will also have been removed from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great depth running!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday, at 83 years of age, from a lung cancer in his joint of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema for the last few years.
Less memorable than Brandon, to whom he seemed and for a long time was a kind of rival to the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also attracted freedom and the eclination of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood is often made of wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
Of these European races is one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without myself, last brand of quality.
Because it is designed by a nation that is driven by itself, by the fighter of the war of the Pacific, who, in the early 1950s, studied the dramatic art in Yale and then frequented the Actor's Studio of New York, before triomphere at the theater, on television, shortly before the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the car pilot who was seconded at 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, which was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The dark, discreet, engaged, allergic areas of the show-business are also disappearing with him, which will not have been all the way through the enigma.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance sought the courage of the cinemas this weekend, while his great role was being played on the black screen of memories.
More than a half century after a seventh American art in permanent change through it.
Reminiscent of the love cow-boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual husband (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a set of fires adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have gone through history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, guilty, tortured, violent, unrecognizable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, reborn after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathic evil in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
Amer and winner in The Hustler de Robert Rossen (1961), he will take back the personage on the return to The Color of Money of Martin Skorsese, which was valued in 1987 by his only Oscar on nine nominations.
This face over the years, it was him.
He's still there.
The ages are baffling through their course.
Young people especially know him through George Roy Hill’s cultural Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, the leader of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With the latest role of the Irish mafia in the Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the hole was broken.
In the encounter with several movie legends that were released early in the afternoon, Newman will remain in the cell for a long time, while disclosing Hollywood, his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
The French movie Bertrand Tavernier would consider it, not humourless, "as a challenge living in "the underplaying" judging its over-supported benefits.
The profession has not always been designed for the beauty of Paul Newman to which the roles have long taken all the bones in the beak.
However, it often plays less young people than the marginal ones: nevrosed, alcoholics, saluds or desperate, whose perfect treatments reflect the advantages and disadvantages.
As a realist, Newman reveals the bad faces of his true Pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), along with his wife, Joanne Woodward, played a major role in the development of a woman's melancholy portrait.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, worked hard and sad.
Among the rain of men who died yesterday on Newman, his great partner and former armed companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very attractive: "His presence has given my life and this country the best."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating treaties of the deceased actor.
In addition to its legend career, a large warrior for civil rights, the ecology, the independent cinema, a protestary of Hollywood's profits.
We will see a lot of his benefactor treading on wineries, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of eating bad tastes, whatever goes away.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be engaged until the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And it's a privilege for us to follow the course of an American artist so bright and so generous.
Citizen model, in sum and above.
What could make Zuschlag &amp; Company in their invoices?
Next, on 8 October, hearings on the ongoing criminal proceedings will be held against János Zuschlag and its complexes.
Politicians and their complexes are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, permanently and regularly, resulting in particularly significant damage. Other leaders have been detained against them, for example, false and false use.
According to the park, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the State and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, would be part of the Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the minority of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to affect the money of the grants received by issuing costs invoices, after which no real performance was provided and thus the associations never respected their commitments.
According to the case-law, a large part of the invoices were incorrect.
For the latter, they were looking for invoice cards on the Jozsefváros market, while they were making the caches in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to be included on the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tournaments in the north of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, on the request of Janos Zuschlag.
According to the deposition of the latter, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for a bill, on the model for which they realized the other invoices they were going to introduce, inter alia, to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as to the Office of the Capital for Subsidy.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and by his complex András Žhri, which, according to our information, was mainly concerned with preparing the files needed for the acquisition of subsidies.
In a "repair circuit," one of Lados' choices was a bishop.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 persons, members of Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for as many people as possible to take this place at the same time.
In the same way, by the year 2002, the bill established in the name of the Jobb Jövőert Foundation, which will then bear the name of Egypt in Harmadik Éveredert, was due to false forms and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had only three rooms, and 10 people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned hundreds of customers.
In their accounting, Jobb Jövőret, or the Hoppa, did not appear in the park, according to the information given at the park.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told hvg.hu that when the park called him and showed him the facts, he found that he was wrong.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cover."
He added: "More than that, the fact that hundreds of people lived there after the bill was no longer there was no more, because this establishment only remembers 11 rooms, which have not so much place.
Furthermore, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of green invoices were no longer informed about Budapest travel agencies, taking part in their selection, but not organizing travel abroad. Thus, of course, they indicated stay in Hungary on invoices to regulate in species, which is also going to happen to the agency's accounting practices.
As noted in the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, while the benefits of travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of four invoices set in the name of the Hotel Revfülöp on the order of Jobb Jövőert was incorrect, as the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Moreover, the hotel employees do not issue only printed invoices, while the errors were made in hand.
The survey in the park reveals that the "emissions" also made mistakes by referring to the provision of road freight transport, that the issuing company could not carry out the invoices, since its profile was the investment advice.
In addition, it is also for various forms, such as inadequate invoices and false caches, that invoices issued in Egypt at Harmadik Áveredtér Alapitvány, of XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesulet and Biztos Pont have been shown to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the sports stage of Kunfehertó, which both refuse to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Fascists have not paid any attention to the fact that the HIB Kft., located in Nyíregyhhaza, was liquidated at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városert Egyesület group was intended to take a meal with them. According to our information, that is why the liquidator of the company did not issue this invoice.
Deployed factors
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were quite aware that they were asked to issue invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapesttér Alapítvány, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal Group - Ifjj Socialistták, has established a bill on the basis of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Üveveredert, for a total of four million HUF.
According to the charge act, the manager of Collab Kft. was led to false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags, the Biogate Ltd., which is currently liquidated and which in 2003, issued invoices under the Jobb Jözéret Alapitvány, Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesüet, for an amount of about five million HUF, but after which no performance was actually provided.
There was no financial movement, no more, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies were careful not to mention them in their accounts.
The following category of invoice issuing companies is that of the companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft, who was responsible for the fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose social headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment for an amount of approximately 18 million HFCs.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Ltd. of Kiskunhalas, which was liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian man who would also have obtained documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Egypt at Harmadik Áveredtre Alapitvány, and that he persuaded them against his employer.
It is precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian monkeys created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were working, but the accused explained that they did not receive work.
It is also used by these companies, since, at the request of Master Zsolt Sainte, co-accused as well as the editor of the company's founding acts, it has established invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáção.
Kubatov gave to agencies, 15 total invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade companies for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The park thought that 10 per cent of the invoices and VAT were due in the Kubatov village.
He even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fiscal invoices used in the application for Biztos Pont grant.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generation and Society for Modern Hungary submitted a request for grants to the socialist party's public utility organization, Tancsic Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They received this grant for a double amount of 500,000 HUF, but these amounts have not been used for the purposes indicated in the request.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from the Workings Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In addition, these figures were found during the investigation carried out at the office of Arpád Kemexei, in the Ministry of Education.
In the hearing, a party of the accused will relate to the method of manufacture of invoices, as it had already done before the parking lot.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decided to take the road across the story.
So far, his eyes are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the least details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if then, socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would only carry the hat.
Today, the latter is likely to grow, as requests for its residence in supervised residence, on the basis of an allegation of its conditions of detention, continue to fall in the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more serious damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, freely or at least do, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
Surgeon Psychology: why do we spend more money?
In sales to customers, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the market.
Researchers in neurology and economy at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in Science magazine, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as a sale to eBay encherries, and that is why they prefer to pay too high prices.
These researchs have tried to draw a neurological scheme of this kind of "yu" by means of sales to experimental enchies.
One group of volunteers played the role of the lobby, while the other group participated in the sale of toys, while using a functional magnetic resonance (IRMf) process, researchers analysed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants were able to win money, but during the sale to the encherries whose essential element is the surrender of a third, the whole being under the cerebral throne, called striatum, was moving intensively at the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to researchers, the amount of prices is explained with the escape from the violent reaction of the stratatum.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In those cases, three groups were in the process of confronting a partner under different circumstances.
They simply informed the product's real value control group in question, and thus carried out their implementation.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would profit from the party, they would receive $15 additional, in return.
While the third group received the $15 before the charges were received, the members of the group also lost that money, where they lost the charges.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was placed at one on the victory, while the other on the left.
In proving the hypothetical of neurologists, members of the team of players "to the left" were prepared for higher missions than those carried out by the control group and the "to the victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the phenomena identified in sales to customers except by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories, and now, on a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of economic sciences at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when do we have to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of patients are carrying hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven thousand are following treatment. That is why patients often do not know that they are carrying the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of liver and kidney are characteristic, but pathogens and genetic diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis virus, according to pathogenic genes, is mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g.: food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (semi, vaginal secretion, salt).
For passengers, it is recommended that you vaccine yourself against virus A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by a bad general state, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white eye a visible youth, the cells become clearer and the urine takes a more focused color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as the cancer or cirrhosis of liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only one ten-year-old is receiving medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to a cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most diseases cannot reach the virus, because pathogen gene suddenly destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Pollution is much higher than the average of one population of three groups: people who have had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and drug addicts.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratory routine examination, it is recommended to consult your doctor who has been treated since the observation of unknown symptoms of origin.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be spread by the body, thus risk of contamination disappears and cancer development is prevented.
30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by agencies representing diseases around the world.
Its aim is to focus on chronic liver surgery, caused by viruses, on the causes of its development and on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to recent research, religious faith would function as a kind of analgesics, which would already have contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more supportive.
The British Telegraph daily published an article that researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience by analyzing the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of human being.
In the context of this experience for the least odd, 12 Catholic believers and so many athletes were subjected to electrochocs, while each observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the suffering.
Through a human brain palpation technique, it has also been found that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences involving academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, experience comes from the following way: an instrument that emits particles and distributes electrochocks is fixed on the right hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked participants of the experience of looking in a way that supported two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the Hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers at the beginning of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would reveal a kind of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, would have affected his appealing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during this time, 20 electrochocs were received in four parts, either by means of religious painting or by more general theme.
The Catholics said that in the eyes of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe" as someone who is "careful" and are“ calm, and peace has invaded them."
In view of religious thematic painting, they accounted for 12% of the pain in less than when they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the experience, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image in the Athletes, provided that the appropriate photo can be found.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, an English bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, is the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if it was shown to believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or a painting of the same caliber?
Would seeing a better quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you reveal to your subject.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says we can find it at the bottom of the people's pockets as well as the sky above their head. He knows where they have gone, what specialists they consult and what are their center of interest.
This is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
As for the scepticals setting a parallel to Orwell's horror vision, they just don't see the essence of the 2.0 web.
Eric Schmidt stated, there was little in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to collect more information about its users. This is necessary for Google Founders to be able to meet their initial goal, which was as follows: "Get all the information in a system!".
According to Google's manager interviewed, after ten years of global warming work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all information.
To the question: what will it be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would be best for me?" However, the software will not be able to answer that kind of question, simply for the first time, until the day when they will be enough on the users.
It is not perfectly clear for all Internet users that the words used during Internet research, the computer's IP address that starts the search and the pages that are then consulted by interested people are accurately repertoired.
Through the program Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have looked for. Through this, in the long term, recommendations, programs based on the same logic will be able to provide much more personalized responses, and we will submit products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he sees what my work is? ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopolies.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society that can cause fear, and this is not the reparation, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or perhaps the rebellion against power that can arise in the internal community.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such a legal case, there is nothing to protect the personal rights of the international community.
The most interesting example of these recent years is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google sent to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing it to be identified.
Interested individuals in the rights of the person have been able to breathe a sigh of relief in the latter, when Google, in his arms with the EFF legal protection body, has proved his right to the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will not always be required by any point of the constitution of disclosure of information on the FBI's confidential request, of any kind than that.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 research terms that it had succeeded in strengthening the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. However, in the end, it failed to search the search lists for private users, neither the entire list of websites and keywords of these two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is fueled by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their secret sphere and their private domain are suffering when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion against the proud multinational companies of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savagees" gathering the passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "white corporation" by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, as the world's inventor for Windows, and even if both fight for the same purpose.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentation code and the software package, which is constantly cooling, has a much more accessible, younger and cool effect, in the face of the official software agent's practice.
The reason can also be that the geeks see very precisely the problem relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the web 2.0, the key word most pronounced in recent years, just goes back to him.
In fact, the 2.0 website concerns nothing but collaboration, the fact that we deliberately leave behind behind us, and that we serve the communication channels set out to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can have a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other benefits, such as Twitter, or to last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can connect them to a follow-up system, such as FriendFed or Blip.fm. These young people can also have blogs, in which they automatically appear their most recent photo gallerys that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can learn a lot of examples, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the morning's photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the night, or the company that licensed one of his employees, nothing but the sincere opinions he wrote on his blog on top management, can be about one thing: the term of private life is entirely to be taken into account in our day.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and that is how the principle can be defined hiding behind the behavior of today’s young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to cross Google's monopole, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time not deliberately leaving any traces).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that they are not able to find them is not smaller. Google services, through the processing of text in image processing, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to large server parks and which do not meet our best profile, which have been available until this day.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding it, the moment Google will develop its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion). Publishers AdWords/AdSense threaten the number of advertising agencies' business, while the benefits introduced at an even more important rate give rise to serious migrations not only to Microsoft but also to many other information programs.
However, critical observers find, on the other hand, contradictions that have a disturbing effect: for example, the company's top management has rejected, in its entirety, employees' protests, after it has doubled the company's mother's price and after the company has judged too highly the multiple daily restoration, it does not always seem to be the case. All of this seems to be a direct consequence of the fact that in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that harm the good, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are only announced when they can be used. What is more, in the coming months and the coming years, they will make the world move on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving books and Google stores takes such important dimensions that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, some of which fear its health system, because in that case, we can build a complete medical benefit from our previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google mounts a genetic database can give a good first-hand material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel by famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tonnes orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a fascinating way only through Google's data.
Two minors helped rid the tracks of Ozd's double homicide.
"The police called two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to suspects, they helped to clear the traces of the crime." - The commissary of Borsod.
Young people have acknowledged the facts that have been rejected. For the moment, they have been accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungroese Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, are free to defend themselves.
The complexity of killing may lead to a detention which may take up to 5 years.
The suspect of Ozd's double homicide, a young man of 23 years of age, was temporarily detained on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old man had to pay a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt and that's why he attracted his believer, Wednesday last, in a site of Ózd where he killed him, as well as the little daughter of this man, age 9.
According to the information provided by the ICTI, the young man had preceded his crime. The weapon he was going to commit was evidence.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the assistance of specialists.
The Warsaw Bourgeois makes a proposal for the release of the Prague Bourgeois de Prague
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% stock package in Prague's value exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw stock exchange, confirmed this proposal by the Polishs despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw stock exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw bourgeois is in the hands of the State.
99 per cent of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State, who wishes to separate more than 60 per cent of its actions in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic day E15, the Polish proposal is the highest offer that has been made so far for the harvest of the Prague boutique.
According to the Czech press, Vienna's bourse, Nasdaq's trans-Atlantic bourse, New York's Stock Exchange, London's and Deutsche Börse's bourse have made an offer up to this day.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague borough last week, said that the Warsaw borough would be the newest owner, and did not exclude the fact that it could result in the loss of Prague borough in the future.
The value of Prague's prize is estimated between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague pool is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent participations followed by 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, the European press leaders' journals are now calling for a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster, we must be the President of the United States" - accused of the day of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own part behind a bill, improvised to the street, in order to assist in an unexpected situation..."
At the place of a new Pearl Harbour, like billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary mouth in Washington.
According to El Mundo's daily vision, these are the shortcomings of the political leadership there, which led the global economy to the collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system increased every day, and as a result, the world will continue to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, following the vote of the Congress, a real threat, which Washington does not offer political tools to deal with the crisis.
The world economy lies in empty, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the longer-term threat - points out the Geneva Day-Anzeiger.
Some States may still have a rescue grant to their financial institutions, and with the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from failure.
Of course, if more and more banks become such domains, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to do little about their national self-sustainment and to focus on control over the divided financial markets.
Every Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Friday, De Standard, which adds that fearers of European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, similar to Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more realistic.
To date, the EU has not really been affected by the crisis, which, like a tsunami, passes through the old continent on its own.
The "savers" must not then spend 100 billion euros, otherwise it would be fair if they noted that it would be reasonable to touch the money of taxpayers, with the aim of preventing further damages.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bourdon
What better method could be to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if this is not the imitation of an existing barrier detector already in nature?
For example, the one of the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, breastfeeding babies gave strategic idea of starting with Nissan engineers, to inspire them in how they should design the next generation of obstetricians.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan built a small robotic car, a bio-powered self-botitized system of type BR23C, which equipped the quality of bees, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In its flight, each bee is its own space, oval form, which is actually much like our secure protection coke - explained at the exhibition, Kazuhiro Doi, director of the Department of Research and Development and Public Technology of the brand.
The baby's face plays a major role, as it is able to see in all directions, in a 300-degree angle.
To imitate the functions of the eye to the eye, engineers addressed the idea of the telemeter to the laser.
This identifies obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which transforms it into an escape operation all the time.
The perception of the obstacle took place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it into a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any system currently in place, this avoidance approach is completely instinct.
"If it hadn't, the mini robot could not respond fast enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protection package, a layer which for the moment is considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in an eyeline.
In contrast to the bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, in place of the infinite combinations of bees that contain bees to avoid other bees, in our case, only rotary movement, acceleration, and slowing down as manoeuvres at the provision of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses the Lithium polymer batteries which are smaller and whose energy concentration is greater, making them live longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primitive, not data processing, and even less storage capacity.
This mechanism must only deal with a few signals coming in second, and react to those.
It is not necessary to store and react with intuittive logic based on the data of previous manoeuvres. Thus, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
We don't need to remember a giga-octets capacity, or even mega-octets.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant protection. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entry into the cars produced in series over the next ten years.
Another application could be its integration into the GPS satellite navigation system so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its path.
We even gave a name to the baby outside the price
The written version of the $700 billion economic saving plan, aimed at obtaining bank credit, and using several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this sum will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of the new debate, as soon as Monday, Saturday, the local east hour, the leaders of the Congress have agreed on existing disputes since days and days, around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American Chamber of Representatives, after which he has no more to make paper agreements.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates at the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and will be effective, but other measures must still be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question of the salvation of Wall Street, but of turning the economic routes in another way.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 20 a.m., Washington's local hour (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m., according to Central Europe's local time), but did not cause a spectacular amount in the drills.
Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will be the first to vote on the proposal of law in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the new agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress made this night, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
In addition, the different programme of the initial proposal made by the Bush Administration, which mentioned that $700 billion should be spent once, for the acquisition of titles on suspicious credit.
The first 250 billion will be delivered immediately after the adoption of the Congress Act, probably Monday. This first sum will serve the Secretary of the Treasury to buy suspicious bank loans, while the use of $100 billion additional will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The second half of 700 billion expenditure depends on a new decree of the Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to establish a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase suspicious credit, mortgages and suspicious mortgages, as well as other types of “toxic” credit.
The competent authorities of the department have stated that the receipts may be made in the form of a sale to the entrails, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees tools from the source of concerns, for which companies will pay an equivalent premium to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to allocate $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, to deal with the vast collection of doubt, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or more important financial institutions.
"We shall take the necessary provisions, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank managers who are in bad positions and wait for State aid can wait for their payments to be settled, called simply due to other Atlantic parachuts, to be imposed by the government.
Moreover, the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of platooning means that if the Treasury secretariat collects in the form of a sale of deposits, they will take a surplus of tax on the expensive parachutate, unless the President of the Discreet Bank is a party to the withdrawal.
Immediately after the loss of doubt, the Government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exceeded.
In order to complete the image, it is necessary to add that the existing expensive parachutes are not modified. The ceiling is only relevant to the new contracts, this is to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force on the appointments of the Directors General - the President of the Committee on the Financial Benefits of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, the State is seeking a right to purchase shares in banks that take part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they can even be profited in the case since the economy and with it the saved banks will return on their feet.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President must introduce to the Congress a proposal that will provide for the return of losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there was obviously some who expressed their doubts about this plan.
This is not why American citizens have given us a mandate, which does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks that these are the same who are taking measures, than those who are responsible for the Wall Street foundation.

The higher prices of the primary plastic and chemical materials resulted in a considerable monthly increase in the price of the product and chemical manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
A decrease resulted in oil transformation (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in wood transformation (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the transformation industry recorded an increase of 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.

In the next year, will visas still be needed to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement to be implemented on 12 January. That is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
She said, "Now, everything depends more on the time when other Atlantic electronic input and control systems will be put into service."
At times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before the start.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Condolezza Rice, to whom he will present the award of the Cross of Commander with the Star of the Order of the merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the candidates to the presidency, the Barack Obama Democrat and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support both bank rescue plans
On Sunday, Barack Obama, like John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, supported the government's rescue plan of $700 billion. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of State in Tresor.
Following the Marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, the representatives of the Congress and the Administration finally announced on Sunday that they had concluded principles on the Bank's rescue plan.
This funding plan, aimed at degeling the Wall Street crisis and the parallel credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are even present, each as smarter than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, with the introduction of economic issues, Obama has once again succeeded in making some progress. McCain's progress, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a co-list just after the Republican convention, has been founded.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly vote for the 700 billion rescue plan.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer's protective passports that he also supported.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a threat to your work, your economies, industrial sectors all over the world and the stability of the whole economy," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
There was no lack of qualifications for McCain's economies of overpassed ideas.
In an interview on the ABC channel, McCain said: "We're all going to be bad at the eagle (...) but nothing is possible."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal referred to the establishment of a Tresor Control Commission and the imposition of the remuneration of senior managers, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the Chamber of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is a serious hope that the House will vote on the bill this Monday.
The German Language Territory Press Review
The field of right is intact, only in the heart of the party that the electors have become more conscious - that is also the case of Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German left information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic failure of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria Destroys Its Parents".
According to this recognized politician, CSU's erosion began well before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over his functions.
Christian socialists have transformed the Bavière for decades and are now the same modern citizens that turn their back on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and this is also true of Angela Mercer.
For the CSU, the failure was not a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to take place just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was falling by 47.7 per cent, and this for the first time since the fifty-five years, with a score below the level of 50 per cent.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization of "losing its parents", placed in the region consistent with the CSU.
For 40 years, sociologists have announced this, but they have been strongly mistaken about the pace. However, the results of the education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east of the Bavière region, in full development, could not remain without consequences for the integrity of the CSU electors.
Modernization will depend on increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right field is intact, but within the party the electors have become more conscious, more critical and more conscious.
It is also surprising that over the past few weeks, this is just the groups of classic citizens who are rather away from the CSU, such as independents, artists, bankers and higher education graduates.
In these groups, CSU support decreased by 40 per cent.
The printing (depresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who ? With whom ? The presidents of the party are on the reservation to deal with the issues of coalition", the Austrian Conservative Day is concerned with the situation of the confused internal policy that was established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the OPP conservators.
The SVP prohibits SPÖ from dealing with its internal affairs.
The populist part of BZÖ is open for negotiations. Greens don't want to agree on coalition yet.
Elections were held, now all round the coalition; when public television talks were organized, the party's leaders had to let their cards enter.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the SVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is actually possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine would be a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the OZVP, as vice-president, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A duplicate of this combination is out of question.
Mutterer reacted with caution to the red proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will certainly be ineffective if Faymann tries to get involved in OSP’s internal affairs.
In its part, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an open issue. These points must be discussed in the EAGGF.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which is France, has begun as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary, as one of the main forums of the expert consultation, Livia Járóka, Euro Member of the European People's Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, as it is a violation of the right that affects the most Roma children and, in fact, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultation are European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the Press Office of the Group of Members of the Fidesz Parti Populare, Járóka predicted that, on the basis of the distinctions found in the contracts, the Roma disappeared from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"A surprising majority of young Roma do not have secondary diplomas, and as a result of an elementary quality education, only an infirm part has the opportunity to get a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education as an essential human right plays a key role when other fundamental rights are to be valued.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union's member countries.
According to the Euro-deputy, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a widest possible circle, as well as between Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, as soon as a Roma child starts school, he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"From their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education and be protected from low-quality and sectoral education."
According to the MEP, the European Union's cooperation aimed at an objective and action is necessary for immediate acceleration of the school-reducing process, so that compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of primary importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment. It is necessary to give Roma children the opportunity to participate as full-right citizens in the future of Europe," Járóka demanded.
In the name of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" provided for all, the aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has been to provide a single platform to support measures to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination at European and Member States level.
CSU: thanks for a transition period
In October the decision will be taken on the fate of the twelve Huber-Beckstein
Despite this terrible electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been updated.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The end of the tandem, with a loss of 17 per cent, will be at the end of the day of the assembly of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this very criticised couple, however, felt that they were not especially at their seats.
As a result, they were employed to love the angry members of the group and the base, who one day after the "tsunami bavarois" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career, the Socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the posch against Stoiber, it remains only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the only "sovereign" of the Bavière giving 18 percent of the German GDP.
However, conservationists are still very much in this region of the south, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be bound to coalition.
As one of the first signs of the internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also been given a place in this modest group of recognition, which begins talks with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Elections, formed along the lines of the right, on a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange feature of the destiny was that with the help of the Free Elections list, Gabriele Pauli, in the legislation, whose measure against Streiber used the possibility of pussch perpetrated by the Duo Huber-Beckstein, to treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without a home.
Now, the CSU leaders are putting all their energy in order to stabilize, somehow or otherwise, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far taken the branches in the colleges, will also have an active role. The former head of the Regional Government and former President of the CSU, appointed September 28 as the hottest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber launched some comments about the CDU. After him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother's party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defect as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will no longer be able to be chancellor unless they return on foot in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU has played an important role in national success in 2005.
According to Merkel, trying to hide his disappointment caused by the failure, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect Berlin's large coalition.
What is relative, however, is that it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis remains.
Since 1946, SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavière.
Lukasenko - its rivals : 110 - 0
No opposition member came to the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which guarantees its prosperity and stability, while after the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by the illegality of voting.
The OSCE, sending 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation composed of 110 million people in this country has been very opposed for decades, prior to yesterday's elections, the opposition joining its forces under the name of the Union Democratic Forces (ODSZ) was seriously expected by Lukashenko, renewing its presidential mandate for the fourth time in questionable elections, following the amendment of the Constitution in 2006, this time "allowed the presence of some Members of the opposition to Parliament.
In this way, ODSZ gave up its original booklet.
The fact that Belarus, depending on more economically than Russia, wanted to improve its relations with the EU, where, due to the qualified Belarusian policy order of anti-democracy, Lukashenko and several high-ranked politicians did not receive visas was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of presenting themselves for a third of the candidates to the opposition, was a reference to a prior apathy.
However, the OSCE communication on Monday was already in response to the campaign, during which the majority of candidates to the opposition could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were cast.
Nevertheless, the opposition is still a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
"We have done two steps ahead, and one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Millinkevitch in our journal.
According to the 2006 presidential election candidate, it is desirable that this remain, despite the fact that "the power in this Parliament which has no power to make even one objection".
The opposition does not provide for protest actions in view of the results, but rather tries to reach out to its message on the need for economic reforms to the electors.
"Of course, we are very concerned about this: we have to print our opposing journals in Russia, the local authorities put our shoes in the streets for what is of circulation, but I can also see that they are more to support the elections, even in the circle of older people," Milinkevitch said, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the most officially supported resort is not considered as appropriate.
"Because of the closure of the country and the increase in commercial deficit, the collapse of social security, 'the silence of a cemetery', is no longer a matter of time' - I believe Milinkevitch.
In contrast to the opposition's policy, Russian observers qualified the democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Community Mission of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words, but in deeds." Thus, the absence of opposition is not just proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From today, a little breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palais, there were no round doors for the entry and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in force against the small ills, against which it points and will then drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new anti-factants were presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the President of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turnout doors-telling Brunetta-are an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presence and more services," said the Minister.
Now a new cycle of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's reformism" also emphasizes Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No employee resistance has been recorded, the Secretary-General shall ensure that "it is a process shared by employees, and we have all cooperated".
In short, less breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the communiqué said that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease was reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand workers more than a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make it more effective, the Public Administration.
Italy, "including wage dynamics, explains the Minister-in the past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and also inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees are united to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree applying to the Codacons.
" while the Minister of the Public Service today maintains the data on the reduction of unemployment at work for the cause of disease, the association of consumers - the people of "active workers" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees from the Public Administration met to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, Tar is opposed to the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service; the extension of the hours of household stay of the sick worker, during which visits to control are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister's wishes.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Crescent Prevention"
Every day, 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, Inail's data confirmed that the white dead were about 1,200.
Numbers that testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of deaths, and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to pay attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil is now celebrated today in all Italian provinces on the 58th National Day of the Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second day of October.
"The disturbing data spread by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of prevention on the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, when sending a message to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Inalienable Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its heartfelt appreciation for the continued partnership effort to prevent workplaces, protect workers from accidents, help the families of victims and raise awareness of public opinion.
"Of course, everyone has hit the bridge to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, causes the media clarinet and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repeatable cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep an eye on this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber highlighted the fact that this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions a specific effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data on accidents at work appear to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive" later highlighted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "dangerous tendency" to be translated, in fact, less attention, because it is just when attention is relaxed, which is the tragedy.
"we believe that in general, we are not done enough to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"We have stressed that Mercandelli - more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this from school."
- He added: "It is necessary to make further efforts with regard to the communication and awareness of public opinion.
"But above all, there is a greater sense of the responsibilities of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for the protection of compensation provided for the victims of work" and "the result of assistance to which the system has originated in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance - it has been added in such a way that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on spontaneousism or the expansion of the legislator"
Mp3 reader points from the right, they risk hearing.
Listen to the music in full volume for a long period using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a communication published in Brussels, refers to the Scientific Committee's opinion on the unforeseeable and newly identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
" in this scientific report, we note that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with full volume using portable music devices, for more than one hour a week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones with full volume can unwittingly damage their hearing in a manner that is indisputable," says Meglena Kuneva.
" According to scientific data, the responsible Ue- it is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What is most important is raising awareness of consumers and making this information public.
We also need to review existing control systems for scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, taking into account the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists conclude that Ue's executive confirms that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now consider with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to improve the protection of children and adolescents, against noise exposure from portable and similar music devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of 100Db portable music devices, but the anxiety increases as to the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data to solutions such as reducing levels and the duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that the users of portable music equipment, who listen to music with volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limit for the maximum noise level allowed on the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions during extended periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This interest is 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be estimated at about 2.5 million and 10 million people in the United States.
Rome, Germany has ordered the Commission to do so for the future of capital.
Today we start, in March, and we end in June.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Committee for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Thermes de Caracala.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other Commission components will point to the guidelines for Rome.
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the Council will assess the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Rome Strategic Plan with the " official time " of the Capitol and its Master Gianni Germano.
" The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it should stress that it should propose ideas for development in Rome which could be used by policymakers, which remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a major project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise period of time.
In June-Announcer will present to us the strategic plan for the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, seeing that its opinions are not binding, Germany repeats: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is, as in France, thanks to the Attal Commission, as in Rome, I am on it, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is managed by day-to-day management and the emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see ahead, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic body: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to Roma citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligence that expresses capital.
For Germany, in fact, "there is a need for a development of strategic reference, neither firm nor real, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while considering its future being a united spirit,".
A future that, explains the capital of Rome, "will not limit itself to the usual community borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first American president, that's why.
"Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and threw out reports (as he still has today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama increase as the date of elections approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is truly disappointed: he believes he will win the highest role of a nation that counts in everything, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, it is an attack that does not say much; it is obviously a racial attack, and it does not answer the question of all voters: will it be a good president? We also have the polls, which all said that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it's still about someone who talks to the heart and not to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know exactly who the American patriot will vote.
That's where an aspect of American thinking goes on to remain secret until the end.
"Tell me what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we leave the United States.
Things that have never been revealed so far, in such a way that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In spite of all these reasons, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
What were the errors made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent back to it at foot-to-ends.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives, and Americans have not been forced to make the elections.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Use, economic degradation makes itself felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for the removals. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
And well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly declared access to information, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as sometimes.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastating economic model crisis.
In addition, the removals in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work in the newspaper collection, are a major problem.
This is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is to be understood by the general public, it will not be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism envas American journalism.
Six out of ten seniors and journalists of press journals are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against Broadcast.
Journalists don't have any trouble seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses take a walk to the Internet, seen by many as "the killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest growth in American journalism lies between those who lead the newsrooms - that is, the directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "working security".
Directors who are thinking of losing their job in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we're going to be 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (we editors, etc) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand per month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, has been a number of years.
But, according to their findings, American journalists are often "bad" during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPOL IS RELEASED TO GROOTTAPERRATA.
The President of the second criminal section of the Roman court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the property agent's office, Danilo Coppola, who had requested permission to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a room in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankerage under the Unipol-Bnl scale instruction.
During his trial, he had been released last week as a compulsory resident in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the city of province to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the pm did not grant) would have to influence his company and have access to evidence that accused him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion saved plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and it is still more interested in paying Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its East Coast guard, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, just, is made to feel despotically with the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake has foretold or has already caused: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and can only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena that have taken place for a while, so that in the new climate, they are solidified and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relaxation of the double category of sovereign state, in relation to a kind of economic recovery.
In fact, the crisis is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that, of course, have close relations with the foreign but, above all, are involved at large, the balance of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for which the government is responsible: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also electoral.
In short, the crisis seems economically global but politically, it's almost national.
Political internationalisation seems to seem to be out of play or out of line, but there is little to say that the clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, divided as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, does not reach a common political line.
Thus, it is from the Government of each State that all are waiting for interventions, rescue and relaxation plans, new rules, and especially a credit rating: when a difficult period is over, there is only the economic resources of the countries that have the financial resources to try to put things in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of an invaluable value, elements that no international market or organization will ever have.
This new phase of the state crisis is in perfect harmony with the increasing importance of economic developments in the economy tending to be a sufficient factor related to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we are now entering the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we are given a single set of accounts, that our future must rather than regulate its accounts with things as little material as water, harvests, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, he certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, one who has the evil to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fraction.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politicians, and so Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective of authoritarian leadership needs, the search for a person who knows how to take care of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leaderships, economic species that have been found inadequate and full of dream areas.
Moreover, something more profound, in some sense, even worrying: a discrepancy, suffering, an inadaptation image, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
in short, the demand for leadership, underground food, a powerful and ramified movement of delegation of the governing classes and traditional political orders, which is reflected in the unprovable electoral "revoluted" revolutions or, in the recent recent changes of collective famines, from the conservative Ascension in Austria to the loss of workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and it could well be that the victory of the right in Italy was not achieved by Hasard).
It is believed that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their journals, their intellectual credentials, their format, would say something, which is not too difficult today, to understand and thus represent the deep roots of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is growing, increasing and potentially increasing.
In view of all of this, speaking of a current "rebellion of masses" on the agenda, it seems frankly exaggerated.
But let's say well, keeping the big eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Increase the laws of gravity through a super hill and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of several American research centres, and today a team of four institutions has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring up to five inches [2.5 cm] square, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The American Science magazine published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is a development of those we know who use a particular carbon structure called nanocarbon tubes.
"The principle of the hill can be imagined as a series of tubes available as a spaghetti pill." Explain zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the patterns of geckos, covered with microscopic dust that ensures the animal, a perfect adhesion.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as the glass, the Teflon, and the glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patterns of these reptils, and at the same time, that it "depends easily on the paroi" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
MARCHER ON THE MURS?""This material could be used as temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on the pairs like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use, such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon tubes are heat drivers and electric currents.
Other applications could involve aerospace engineering.
For now, not superhero.
AUDRE RECHERCHE - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers presented an adhesive of microfibres like hair, which automatically cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: Never with fruit juices.
Attention to the juxtaposition, orange and pummel.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are depleting and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vitamins, may increase or decrease the absorption according to the case, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in butter or in cash, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th American Chemical Society's national meeting in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: enough wine of palm-mose, orange and pomme juice to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, reducing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The papplemous judge has already been strongly criticized because it held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytic, stemal and neurological drugs, to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS A RISQUE - It is the Italian Medicine Agency itself, which has given the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the risk of this mix and to pay attention to what is being done, if medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone are taken.
PAS WHAT THE PAMPLEMOUSE- According to experts, even the judge of orange and pomme contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active principles that are inhibited by the pampelmusse and the other judges.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at Milan's Public University, called: "These findings are generally reported immediately to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the medicines.
It is always appropriate to read the illustrated papers of the medications we take, and, if something is not clear, don't impress yourself, but clearly address the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to Ansa.
The Nobel of the Economy in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Kruggman for his research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Chinese student who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editorialist in New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the foreign economic and political solutions of Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's failure, Krugman wrote, in an article published on New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A vision that is disintegrating from many polymers, which has been brought to the economy for years, but which has now become clear.
"I am surprised and even somewhat shocked by the speed with which the memory of such scandals as Enron's or Worldcom's collapse has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive disclaimer, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
This is the day of the deployment of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the following open source of personal productivity that aims to touch more and more users, from house to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the public with various news: the welcome screen, and the revised and less austerated interface, such as the naked compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office in 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to certain modules, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, are useful, for example, for sending them by email, or for importing PDF files into the graphical design module, while preserving the original aspect of the page.
Every day on this front, it is possible to create "PDF hybrids" documents that combine the typical Adobe format chart with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text manufacturer.
Cooperation between several persons is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the preparation of texts, as each contributor is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to get some of the OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/Download/3.0.0/Download300.html and is added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the follow-up is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be sent home or at work.
And if the topic of freeness can be a means of spreading it in the homes, it is just in the business, that Open Office then tries the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Without account of the realities that provide training, consultation and assistance, ideals for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for the text video equivalent to Word ; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Print, for powerPoint rival presentations;Base, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; eventually Drwa is the graphical module.
Objective for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are nearly 3 million and 600 million people, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl too, it's positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is about the Austrians of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and the winner of the best Grimmer mail.
This is the website of the daily team that reports the news.
At 26 years of age, Kohl is the fourth positive cycler in Cera, the third generation episode, followed by the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests performed on Kohl's samples are part of what has been done in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If anti-analysis confirms the positiveity of the Cera, Austria will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The new positiveness of Kohl at the Third Generation Age was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who communicated to the Associated Press, had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus refurbishing the e-mail from the best Grimmer.
Immigres:New YORK TIMES ARE DEAD IF ITALIA IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed them with reticence.
Would this turn the Great Country into a nation of racists? Is that what the New York Times are interested in? It is a long article discussing racism in Italy, which tells of the case of young Abdul William Guibre, the original of Burkina Faso, who killed Milan last month, to fly a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what New York Times defines as "the North Paradox": the Nordic regions are both where it is recorded" more integration and more work, but also "a strong anti-immigrant sense of the country and the most important support to the North Law"
In order to confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the outbreaks of intolerance by Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by the Law to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestine citizens is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
A trend highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, when he met with Benoît XVI in the Quirinal, asked what the State and the Church were working together to win racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student housing market did not know of the crisis
According to the last survey of the Sunia, renting a simple room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects of the exclusion of all categories of young people, of the right to study at global costs that families of origin must support - the responsibility of the study office in Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand for students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, unlimited rent, sub-locations.
For the Union, extraordinary measures through the revision of tax tax are necessary to ease prices.
In detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, about 450 euros is needed; for a simple room, we go from 650 Euros to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, an average bed, EUR 350/400, a room is about EUR 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on the nearby areas of the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double bed and 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the areas near central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a simple, 450 lit in a double.
Lower values (550 euros for a simple) for areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We can only save if we stay away from it in the periphery areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple in Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a litt it takes EUR 300/400, for a simple price it costs from EUR 400 to EUR 600, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, at least 350 euros are required for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of greater importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, are listed further anomaly: the rent requested for foreign students is 25/30 per cent higher than that applied to Italians.
Adieu old Paradise cinema, the cities are the historic halls.
Historical cinema rooms are closed in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinema rooms is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The picture offered by the scene artist Giuseppe Tornatore, well illustrates what is happening in the great Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The marginalization process of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large halls, and the death of mono-room consumption in the central areas of the city, is one of the major events that appears undisputable and unconstitutional; it also has all the features of a genuine cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical and memory-loaded places, "is like if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a lot of the way and so much emotions" observes the filmmaker of the New Film Paradise, which offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of Cannes's jury, and who reported the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, can be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trader association, mean that in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid most of their costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions by the closure, Emilie Romaine is headed by 82 cinemas of the missing rooms, followed by Toscane (44) and Lombardie (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsibility for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because these are the three most recent Italian regions that have recorded the most recent multi-scalal cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardie these five years, 81 in Toscane as in Emilie-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed radically," observes Paolo Protti, President of the Year, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should also ensure the survival of those who already exist, because when a closed room in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily all ready to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the lack of credit for traders, the previous debt of the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between €16 and €18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned by these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Marie and Anec, the first of which is in Italy, to defend and promote the mono-room cinemas of historical and periphery centres.
Among the regulations provided for, there are measures for tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for stations and in some parking areas.
"It's an initiative that I'm asking for," notes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by taking other measures.
It is clear, however, that, in order to counter the superpower of multiples, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Supercinam of Baghia, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the essence that convinced me to make the "New Paradise movie that I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal de Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the dark panels by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘dragheta’, the mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to unify Mary's choices to the interests of the Piromelli clan."
of serious charges are launched by the judges of the Calabre Anti-Fraud Directorate, against the mayor and vice president of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarino Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for massive association.
The handles are also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his little lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association with massive-type offenders, and for paying 10 million euros.
"a conflict with legal and moral norms, and especially with good intentions," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations expressed their desire to pay consultations at Master Piromalli.
"If it had been given to the clan - writing the judges - to enter officially within the palaces facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabria Regional Committee, Agazizio Loiero, has only hidden "collusions between local committees and organised crime, there is more than one" in its region: "there are places where the vast intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the dragongheta, heroes who are honest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of July last, followed by the police announce that the Piromelli clan had disappeared.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to the alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been deprived of their duty to administer the City.
Giorgio Dal Torione, head of the UDC at the time of the resolution, was appointed head of a right centre coalition after the May 2006 ballottage.
He creates the scandal when the prefecture orders the dissolution of the council.
He accuses the Deputy Minister of the Interior of the time, Marco Minniti, who has accused him of mismanaging everything for a political issue, but in view of the application for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromolli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
Among the interviews ordered against Dal Torreone, the pm writes, "the availability of a business man's requirements, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, aligning the public administration's choices with the interests of the clan.
When energy is born of waves, now the bigs begin.
This is a decomposition that covers more than 70 per cent of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are finding out.
Vagues, churns, marinas, here are the new sources that the Colossians like Chevron have put their eyes on, and they are now trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the low oil price, by 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was on the side, but now the ecological authorities and the new increase in oil are giving a great boost to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated that in 2007, 15 per cent of the global electricity demand could be covered by the operating systems of the sea floor.
This amount would be the double of the nuclear power plants.
And also, there would be the racers and the marinas..
He's in the attack.
The first marine energy undertaking was Enersis, who signed an agreement to build an installation in North Portugal in 2005.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been said a true revolutionary step.
Two years ago, more and more of these dedicated companies were still in traditional energy supply.
"Chevron is currently studying oceanic energy technologies," said the spokesman of a company associated with the American oil column, the economic day Wall Street Journal, and it assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to the acquisition of a licence issued by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to provide a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, Usai continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavatings.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which walk the way of the energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although their details are unknown, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to focus.
Experts are still talking about technology at its beginnings, in part because marine energy does not expose fear to the ecological impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small-scale, and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of benefits related to each other.
The pressure of the waves, which pushes the waves up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the fleets.
The pressure turns a turbine that runs around, feeding a generator.
The power is sent to the river through the cables under the sea.
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, waiting for a single federal approval and a part of energy could serve as a military facility.
On the contrary, Power is already producing energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six turbines under the East River of New York.
The movement of water in the seas, turning the walls of the turbines, creates a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
He announced that he had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary powers to power.
After the vagues, the marinas.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for Energy Research, which is now worth the potential of marinas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the marina is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just on the energy of the marches that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, looked at the coast, invested $7 million and half dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million in 2009.
