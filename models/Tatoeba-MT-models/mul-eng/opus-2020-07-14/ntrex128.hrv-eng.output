The great Sabor representatives are worried that they will "see as Muppeti"
Some members of the Assembly Member, AM, have proposed that they be called Members of the Parliament of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans for the summit to be renamed the Great Parliament.
Sabor's representatives from all political spectrum are worried that they could become the subject of a mission.
A Association Representative from the Laburist Party said his group was concerned because the name "remotes with Twp and Pwp".
For reading outside Wales: on a large twp means stupid, and pwp shit.
Sabor's representative from the Party of Wales (Vest. Plaid Cymru) said that the group was "not satisfied" and submitted alternative solutions.
A large conservator said his group was "open" to change its name, but that MWPs can quickly become Muppet.
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the phrase "w" in Irish.
The Association Committee, which is currently preparing the law on the introduction of a change of name, announced: “Of course the final decision will be made on how representatives of the Association will be entitled to be on their own. ”
The law of the Wales government in 2017 gave the Grand Chamber the authority to change its name.
In June the Committee published the results of the public consultation on proposals that have been found in broad support for the change of the call for the Assembly in the Great Parliament.
When it was about what representatives would be called in the Assembly, the Committee was calling "Members of the Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support during the public consultation.
Saborian representatives suggest alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus could lead to the head of the Elin Jones Council, which is expected to make a proposal for a change in law within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the Council, including rules on the disqualification of representatives of the Council and the establishment of a system of committees.
During the discussion on the law of the Sabor's representatives, they will have a vote on the question of how they want to be called.
Macedonians are going to the referendum on the change in the country's name
The voters will vote on this Sunday if they want to change their country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The purpose of the vote is to resolve the decades-old dispute with the neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long argued that its name of the northern neighbour represents the ownership of the Greek territory and has been opposed to the initiation of its EU and NATO accession procedure.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an anti-pélicist on the change of name, said he would not accept the referendum decision.
However, the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claims that the change is a simple price that is necessary for EU and NATO accession.
They kept the bells of St. Martin while the church in Harlem fought for survival.
"The older people I talked to said that in the past they could find a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there is no one else."
He said the missing bar is understandable.
"People are friends in a different way today," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms in which people regularly spend their time."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and that “before or later it will be found again at the beginning."
He added that the churches would be able to replace buildings with dwellings in which people who will not help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood will be able to replace them.
"A large majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "that is why they will be faster when those churches are completely closed because it is unlikely that the inhabitants who have moved into these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches built the white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis — the Metropolitan Community of 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodical congregation was settled in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had maintained the ministry near her had taken over the property over the building.
The Church of St. Martin took over the black congregation with John Howard Johnson on his head, who also led a fighter on a small street in 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which was opposed to the recruitment or promotion of blacks.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but since the great-time Johnsons planned its reconstruction, they ordered down the bell, etc. carillon.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and successor in St. Martin, proudly called Carillon “the voices of the poor people. ”
The associate who played on carillone in August used another name: "cultural goods" and "an unprecedented historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a specialist at Michigan University, mentioned that it was also the first carillon in the world to play black singer Dionisio A. Lind who has been playing for 18 years on a bigger carillone in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is a story of architects and construction workers, some of whom brought ease of church leaders, and other episcopal dioceses.
Sakristija, the leading body of the soup made up of a laca, wrote in August for the concern that the diocese would "supply to transfer costs" to the cleaner, although the sacraments were not included in the engagement of architects and construction workers who sent the diocese.
Some people have regretted the lack of transparency on the side of the diet.
A 13-year-old sea horse injured during the hunting in California
According to the official report, the marine dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was hunting for a horse in California on the day of opening the season of hunting on the yacht.
An attack occurred before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel declared to be a KSWB-TV in San Diego that he ran with his friends about an hour and a half in the morning when he heard the boys call for help, and then he led the group to the place of attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was a matter of excitement because of the captured noise, but then he realized that he cried “I was so scared!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his whole key bone was broken.
"I thought everyone came out of the water: 'In the water is a sea dog!' added Hammel.
The boy's a helicopter was transferred to a child's Rady hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at a press conference that the marine dog was caught in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a matter of a dangerous species of the marine dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma on the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Porto beach in Casablada to Swami in Ecinitas in Ecinitasa to conduct a buyer's investigation and security.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of fish in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's company plans for entry into the beauty market in UK
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for Lancis like Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic bottles in the style of slaves' houses and by hireing specialized sellers.
In addition to a large market entry of UK beauty worth 2.8 billion, which continues to grow in line with the fall in sales on the market of clothes and household equipment, larger cosmetic bottles will be tested in 11 markets across the country and will be expanded to additional trade next year if they are shown success.
The investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways in which supermarkets try to use the police space that was once foreseen for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's company representatives said they would double the size of cosmetic products for 3000 products, including the first time and the slave brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing assortment of L’Oreal, Maybelin and Burt’s Bees companies will receive more space with areas for certain brands similar to those of Boots.
Supermarket will re-start its assortment of decorative cosmetic Boutiques, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and that's what young buyers are looking for.
In addition, a trader with perfumes Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury's trade, the first one opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the other one opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham this year.
Net purchases and return to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local food shops mean that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Mike Coupe, director-in-chief of Sainsbury's, said he's going to fly more and more like a slave house while that supermarket chain is trying to convince the volunteers like Aldi and Lidl offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlets in hundreds of shops in Argos, as well as a large number of Habitats' departments because he bought two chains two years ago, and the claims motivated the sale of living vegetables and made this adviation more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to clean up its cosmetics and pharmaceutical products has not been successful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint interview with Booths in early 2000, but it ended all the way around the medical department's income in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury's sale of its pharmaceutical business to 281 Celesi, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago.
He claims Lloyds will have a role to play in the plan by setting up an assortment of luxury products for his skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director Sainsburys, said: “We have changed the look and smell of our cosmetic products so that we can give our users a better environment.
We've also put in special training for a colleague who's going to be at the hands of the buyers and give them advice.
Our assortment of trade marks is designed to meet all needs, and attractive surroundings and available locations mean that we are now attractive destinations for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in the old buying habits."
Peter Jones "sensed" after Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds
Dragon's Den Peter Jones's Emission Star left to "heavy box" after TV director Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds with his own slave brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their house clothes and fashion supplements Truly.
Their slave brand is compared with the slave brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning (37) emissions manager at Instagram announced to leave.
Holly Willoughby left the stars of Dragon's Den Peter Jones's show to cook out of the heat because at the last moment she withdrew from a joint profit business to focus on her own new wonderful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source claims that Jones was "beautiful" when a gold girl on television during a busy meeting in Marlowe's office in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contract worth up to 1.5 million pounds means that there is no time to devote their domestic clothing and fashion supplements to Truly.
This work was compared with the slave brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double the Willoughby wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) on Instagram announced leaving Truly, Jones moved from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source stated: “Truly was one of the greatest Holly priorities.
This should be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was all involved in that business.
No one could believe what's happening on Tuesday so close to the whole line.
In Marlow's warehouse, there's a lot of slaves ready for sale."
The experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning's emissions leader, one of the most expensive stars in Britain, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large resources invested in products in the range of jackets and candles to clothes and home clothes and the possible additional delay of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long - term friendship.
Mother's three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tarom Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as president of the administration in March.
Couples spend their vacation together, and Jones has a share of 40% in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador to the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of the ITV emissions and celebrity.
The source near Jones said last night, "We do not want to comment on his business activities."
Hard talks, and then we fell in love.
He was referring to the criticism that would be received in the newspapers because of comments that some might consider "unsufficient president" and because he has such a positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
"Why did President Trump give so much impressions?"
said Trump, echoing the voice of the leader of the news.
"I didn't give any inputs."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in another meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June called for a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization were closed.
More than three months after a meeting in Singapore on Saturday, the main diplomat of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North has not noticed the "responsible reaction" of the US to North Korea's entertainment activities.
He noticed that instead of that U.S., he hasn't yet removed the sanctions to which the objective of further pressure is.
In his speech, the trumpet took a lot more optimistic.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"He agreed to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results – a break in the attempt to launch rockets, help with the release of soldiers and the return of the rest of the American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to clarifying his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to behave as a president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this pre-filled arena, we would have about 200 people there," said Trump, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of us.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the bombing in Lombok, it was said to non-governmental organizations that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboka’s population has been displaced, there is no declared national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was very clear that she was not seeking international assistance, so it was a little problematic," said Mrs. Sumbong.
Although the Save the Children organization is a team that will travel to Palu, it's still not sure that side personnel will be able to work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in aid efforts.
In view of the continued support of the soil in Indonesia, the country is still unfortunately not prepared to carry with nature the heat.
Although the shelters in the case of tsunamis are built in Aceh, this is not something that is common in other parts of the coastal line.
The absence of siren to warn on the graves in Palu, although the warning was in force, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And in the best time travel between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters add to the burden of logistics.
The hospital's hospital in Lombok is working to take care of the victim's escape on the way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the place of a new disaster.
The improvement of the Indonesian waste structure was the basis of President Joko Vidodo's election campaign and a lot of money was put in the roads and railways.
But the state administration under Jokoa is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and new elections are being held next year.
The Joko also faces the pressure of the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have raised a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes while the Christian and Muslim gang fought in the streets of cats, lions, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Player Liverpoola Daniel Sturridge lost the chance to match Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from the battle in the Premier game against Chelsea in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Jerdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from the hill Chelsea as a result of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He moved a ball on his left leg before he pulled it off to the opposite station.
The ball flew high above the top right corner of the network.
At the end of the fight, she ran away from Cape Arezabalagaya, who jumped to her and entered the network.
"It was imperative to get into this position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get closer to the goal, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming, and I was just a touch ball, and I didn't think too much about it, and I just shot."
Chelsea was headed in half time from 1:0 after the fall of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker followed the flight back to Matte Kovači during this game before he turned somewhere on half the field and stopped at Liverpool's half.
Kovačić has performed a quick addition to the middle field.
Then he walked through a beautiful passing ball that Hazard brought to the ground.
Hazard was armed and shot a ball in the network at the opposite station next to the goal of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Naples in Ligi first in 15 h in the middle of the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea awaits Videoton in the UEFA European League at 15 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami grew at 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia grew at 832, the state disaster agency reported early Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugro said at a press conference that a large number of people were trapped in the destructions of the building after a magnitude 7.5 explosion, which was felt on Friday and caused waves of even 6 meters high.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of broken buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) because of his suspicion of murder after his wife died.
The murder investigation was initiated after a female body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old girl was found at 07:55 with false wounds on Grayson Mews Street, and 32-year-old was arrested for his murder.
The police called people out of that area to answer if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still under way, but I would like you to speak to us all who were near John's street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the residents of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon at the scene came friends who thought they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have announced that it is in the course of and in the process of informing the nearest victim.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter the building nor get out of it.
He stayed out of words when he found out what happened.
Stans are now said to be going to take a few hours until they can't get back to their homes.
The police officer reportedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the crime scene in the woods.
It repeatedly repeats: "That's so horrible."
At 14:00, two police vans were found in the area, and another was parked directly outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the area and controlled the building block.
All who have any information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, called 101 or anonymously to the Crimestopers organisation on the number 0800 555 111, calling on record 247 of 30 June.
Kip Cromwell in Parliament is the newest monument that has been held in the middle of the debate on "the passing of history"
His prognosis would be a poetic justice for nearly the destruction of such English cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's company called Mr Crick's attempt to "foolishness" and "I'm trying to get past history".
John Goldsmit, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate currently leading up to the removal of the chips, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace would become the subject of discussion.
The iconic of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell has never done.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the procedures of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The wonderful restoration of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the way of thinking of the 19th century and part of the history of the people for whom many still consider it to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella is considered by many to be, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, more than today, to protect Parliament from external pressure.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion of the subject is a historical debate that is continuing.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique recognized figure that represents one side of these divisions.
His achievements in the role of the patron master are still worthy of honor and recognition."
The killer's pig died of a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed farmers on the market in southwestern China.
A man for whom the name "Yuan" was only mentioned was found dead pristine arteries and covered blood near the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, published the morning list of southern China on Sunday.
The pig breeder was ready to inject pigs on June 30, 2005, in Xiningu, China's Qinghai province.
Apparently in the middle, he and his relatives from the neighbouring part of Yunnan were traveling to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighbor pig was opened.
He said there was a big man in the room with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighs 250 pounds [250 kg] of fertilizers to death.
The majority of Guyanga news suggests that a relative who was called "Wu" said, "My family's legs were bleeding and damaged."
The security camera footage showed Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The manager of the market said for the evening news that the pigs were closed to prevent someone else from attacking while the police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are reportedly negotiating the death penalty.
Although this rarely happens, the attacks of pigs on people have already been noted.
Swinja attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts in 2016 and her husband suffered from life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig more than 300 pounds [300 kg] had a large farm with a tractor until his wife had killed the animal.
After the pigs ate farms in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "wig".
"They're just kidding.
They're Greek, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's uranus brings strong rain on the southwestern U.S.
As noted, the hurricane Rosa weakens the way it passes through the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring rainwater in the north of Mexico and the Southeast of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa was at 05:00 after the east coast at 140 km/h, which is made up of Uruguayan category 1, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Ross is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific creates a low-pressure area and moves towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches half of the Bay of California in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push the deep layer of tropical waves towards the north towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropgy input in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause the occurrence of what concerns in the large part of the south-west.
In local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rainwaters, cloud bubbles and possible melting in the desert.
The deep layer of the tropical volcano will cause the occurrence of the ovary that will be between 50 and 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southeast, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible that springwaters with rapid deterioration of conditions are due to the spread of tropical rain.
It's never advised to leave the sand for the danger of tropical storms.
A strong rain could turn cannons into a pool of rivers, and graffiti will bring local storm winds and sandy winds.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local strong rain on the parts of southern California.
It is possible that the surfaces are greater than 12 mm, which can cause less cloudy bubbles and skeletal roads.
This will be the first round in the summer season in this region.
The broken tropical lungs will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late evening and on Monday morning morning before the end of Monday and on Tuesday cover the wide area.
The heavy rain will spread in the area on Tuesday, where the borders of the federal states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will reach and last all day in the middle.
In November, there may be a major temperature change across the United States as Arctic is cold, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omahe in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the summer heat will continue to grow and grow again.
It is expected that in most of the Central and Eastern America, the beginning of November will be hot from 27 degrees south to the north-east.
New York City could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a large possibility of excessive temperatures on the U.S. east during the first half of November.
More than 20 million people watched Bretta Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people were watching on Thursday on six television networks, the testimony of candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sexual attack that occurred in the 80s.
In the meantime, the political report continued, and the reporters interrupted the program to report the shift at the last minute of the Friday: agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a single investigation.
Ford told the Senate's court that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh was in a drunk state and tried to take her clothes off at the high school party.
Kavanaugh said in the burning witness that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
The hearing on Friday was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate number of viewers for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's company usually has difficulties with measuring the number of people looking at the content in the regulations.
To help you do that better, it's about a publication that's a number similar to the one that looks at the playing of an American football club or the Oscar department.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the studio strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing, were contacted by Nielsen.
ABC took another location with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen's company reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2,52 million.
There's a lot of interest left after hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that started on Friday.
After the office of that moderate republican minister issued a statement that they would vote for the benefit of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras were filmed on it on Friday morning as he tried to leave the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
A couple of minutes he stood in his head while he was enjoying it in front of CNN's cameras.
"I stand here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think that this land will speak the truth?"
They said to him: "You have power when such women are helpless."
Flake said his office published an announcement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more about hearing the committee.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were still alive when the Justice Committee had to vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said it would only do so provided that the FBI investigated charges against candidates during the following week, which were demanded by the democracies who were at least.
Flakea partially believed conversations with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview for Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 June 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister at the time, in another interview with her in the same issue on the headline, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal is that the United Kingdom and the EU should pay the customs duties "full fraud" to each other.
The murder of Wayde Sims: The police arrested Dyten Simpson of the suspected death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for murdering Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU boxer.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and held in custody under the arrest charge for the murder of the hostage, the police department called Baton Rougea.
The officials published a video record of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eyes in the conflict.
The police found eyes on the crime scene and reported that they found Simpson's DNA on them, reported WAFB, CBS's subsidiary.
After the Simpson police investigation, he admitted he shot Wayde and killed him.
It's a $350,000 guarantee.
The Mortgage Office of the General of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound head through the door.
The police department thanks the working group for the escape of the federal police from Louisiana, the criminal police lab of the federal state, the Southern University police, and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked local bodies for carrying out the law on "reliability and search for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player on the wing was 183 cm taller in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played a haircut for the LSU.
In the average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps after the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said that the team was "expected" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"That's what we always worry about," said Wade.
Vulkan emits smoke in Mexico City
Pepeo that emits the volcano Popocatapetl has reached southern parts of Mexico's capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased crater activity and recorded 183 gas emissions and dust during 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple tension and support.
Pictures on social media showed layers of dust on the windscreens of cars in the squares of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists are applying an increased activity of volcanic activity, which is 72 km south-east of the capital since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in 2017.
Vulcan known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The conflict between the police and the Catalan separatists will be brought to an end by the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the demonstration of independence against the intervention police and after thousands of people joined in protest demonstrations to mark a catalytic polarising vote on recovery.
A group of masked separatists who refused the intervention police started to beat cops with eggs and paints in dust, creating dark cloud clouds on streets that otherwise would be flooded by tourists.
The fighters broke out and later the day the police used the rockets to calm the fighter.
During a few hours, groups that claim independence were scandalized with "There is no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the Unions shouted " long lived in Spain".
Forty people were admitted to the hospital because of the slight injury suffered during the demonstration, local pressure was estimated.
The tensions in the region that are severely independent have not reached even one year after the referendum of 1 November that Madrid declared protuzaconitit, which the Catholics have celebrated.
A large majority of voters decided to remain independent even though the outcome was small because those who opposed the recognition were mostly voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people have been injured in severe conflicts in the past year after the police tried to stop voting in voting locations throughout the region.
The groups fighting for independence spent five nights on the street in order to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who used to call demonstrations on separatists together with his wife said that he no longer hoped that Catalania would get independence.
"We have experienced one of the best moments of the past year.
I watched my parents pay for the happiness they could vote for, but now we're drunk," he said.
Despite having achieved the key, despite the recent victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have been able to hold back this year because they are the most prominent leaders in the self-sustained exile or in the detention in which they are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict caused politicians both sides.
"The situation is all tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been investigating since the end of last year, announced that they will apply for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy for the European elections is the best way to recognize the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men after killing a car in the house
Three men in the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after they had been killed several times in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday about 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the doors were damaged and the building itself.
It's possible that at some point on the car, there's a shot coming out of the plane.
Hope Menge gave Livingston victory over Rangers with results 1:0
First Gold Dolly Menge for Livingston brought victory
The new Scottish Premiership League of Livingston was surprised by Rangers and urged Steven Gerrard to recognize his only second defeat from the eight-year-olds at the head of the Ibrox Stadium.
The Dolly Menge accident showed itself decisive while the boy Gary Holt was dealing with the Iberians in a second.
Gerard's boy still has no victory in the guests in Premiership this season, and the next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league where eight points remain.
Before that, Rangers will attend the Rapid Vienna Club within the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, has increased his ranks of winning at six games, and chief coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's boy had to run before they got that shot, given that their honesty in the attack caused a lot of trouble for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but he was on his way to the bottom, and then Alan Lithgow could only lead the ball wide after he pulled off to hit Craig Halketta's head.
Homeowners are happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties for the guests
And that's how the key goal has been achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free strike, and Livingston imagined opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson accompanying Mengi who hit in the middle of the floor.
Until then, the Rangers had control of the ball, but they faced an unwarranted domestic defense, so naked Liam Kelly had no business.
This continued in the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the strike.
The legs of the Rangers Allana McGregor were prevented by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow has led a wide-ranging attack from another organised assault on Livingstone.
Long addendums failed to cross the entire Livingstone line, and they were not hit by two single players – after Halket's match with replacement player Glenn Middleton and one to play hand.
"Great" from Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scotland's BBC in Areni Tony Macaroni
A great game and the result of Livingstone.
All up to one was perfect, and they continued to overcome expectations on that entrance trip.
Their style of game and personnel tend to change from their return to the big clubs, but a great reward goes to Holt and the way the team has organized themselves from their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was great at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga didn't allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have a pass.
But the Rangers didn't get any encouragement.
They were far away from the standards that set a good game under Gerard.
They couldn't hit the ball until the end. They just opened the hole in the house of a boy, and that's their own call to trade for Rangers, who's in the middle of the story.
Erdogan expected with mixed feelings in Coeln
On Saturday (June 29th) everything was a lot of laughter under the sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan German – whose aim is to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have developed opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of print and access to the EU of Turkey.
Erdogan then went to Coeln to open a huge new jam.
In that city, the largest population of Turkey is outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked the mass collection of 25,000 people in front of the jemmie, but a large number of the presidential accessions that came to see him were on the scene.
And hundreds of demonstrators of Erdogan – from this large number of Kurds – have voiced their voices by condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decisions to expect him with a welcome welcome in the country.
Confronted demonstrations reflect the division that causes a visitor to be praised by some German Turks as heroes, while others attack as autocrats.
The driver on the road in Deptford: the bikelist died in a car crash
Bicyclelist died in a car crash in London.
The Saturday was near the intersections of the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn, on the road with a nice traffic in Deptford in the south of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and emergency relief arrived, but the man moved on to the spot.
A couple of months after the death of another biker and a running driver from an accident in the Chiders street, about a mile away, and half of a Saturday accident.
City police have announced that police officers are trying to identify the man and inform his closest family.
Unfortunately, the roads are closed and bus traffic is redirected, and motor vehicles are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: six police officers injured in the riots
From the prison, the authorities reported that six police officers were injured in a man's prison.
The unrest broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST a week and still lasts.
Special "Tornado" attacks have been carried out in order to combat the tension that includes eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police officers on the face have been assisted by minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “A specially trained prison personnel are working to resolve the incident during the long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff received assistance for the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we clearly want to know that everyone will be responsible for the police and that they can spend a long time behind the solutions."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lard prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by the prisoner.
And in November last year, the intervention police were called into prison to resolve the serious situation in which the personnel were attacked by billiard bullets.
Uragan Rosa to treat Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with native waters (may be useful for dry areas)
The rare thing is that tropical depression strikes Arizona, but there is a chance that it will just happen in the beginning of the next week when the hurricane of Rosa has the rest of his power over the desert south and brings danger from the rainwaters.
The National Hydrometrologic Service has already issued a warning of native floods for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona area, across the south and east Nevade, South California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should approach Phoenix late Monday with the rain and walk right through him on Tuesday.
A national hydrometric service in Phoenix in its tweet stated that “from 1950 onwards, only 10 tropical cyclones have caused tropical storms or depression within 200 miles [320 km] of Phoenix!
Uragan Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent model of the National Centre for Uraganas foresees 50 to 100 mm oborine, with an isolated quantity up to 150 mm on the Mogollonian ruins of Arizona.
In other areas of the South Pacific, including the Stjenak and the Great Base, there is a probability of aorine from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantity up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger from the rainwaters of Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is hit by drought.
Although the floods are a great threat, part of these obstacles could be useful because the current drought regime in the southwestern part of the country.
"According to the American map of dry areas, more than 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme drought, another highest category," declared weather.com
The journey of hurricanes first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of the hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and found 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moved north at 20 km per hour.
The oil was found on the colder Pacific waters, so it was weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that Monday afternoon or evening will be near the coast of Mexico by the forces of the tropical storm.
The rain on parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant threat to the rise of floods.
"The total load expected in the area from the Bay California to the north-west of Sonore is 75 to 150 mm, possibly 250 mm", declared weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and south Utah by late evening.
"The main danger expected by Rose or her remnants is very strong rain on the peninsula of Baja California, on the north-west of Sonor and in the South American desert," they reported from the National Centre for Uraganas.
It is expected that rain will cause you to experience life-threatening rainwaters and cloud bubbles in the deserts in the mountainous region.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage girls and 20-year-olds were arrested for questioning the attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with fatal wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton was found with a wounded teenager.
She's taken to the hospital and she's in a stable state.
The police department of Avona and Somerset reported that they were 17 years old, 2 18 years old and 20-year-old arrested during the night in Radstock's area.
The police officers have called for everyone who has a video of the event.
The trumpet claims that Kavanaugh has suffered violence and anger from Democratic parties
"The voice of Judge Kawanaugh is a voice for the rejection of cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election group in Weheling in West Virginia.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh "patched evil and anger" by the Democratic Party during the nominating procedure.
On Thursday, Kavanauh witnessed before Congress and strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault more than ten years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford witnessed hearing of the charges she filed.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "the American people saw brightness, quality and courage" in Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's vote is to confirm one of the most successful legal concepts of our time, the case with an impartial career in public service," said the accessions in West Virginia.
The president touched upon Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the Republican exit to the election in half of the presidential mandate.
"Five weeks have given us one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really am," he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The Tempp stated that the democratic mission was to "make opposition and disciplines."
The deputy director of the Republican leadership announced to CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination was expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to grow
The governing body announced on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, from which a large number of them had taken huge waves that hit the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when, in a summary of the heights up to six meters, they attacked the coast, dragged many of them to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunami got hit after the magnitude 7.5 hits.
"When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and they didn't immediately try and beat," Sutop Purwo Nugroh, an Indonesian spokesman for the BNPB disaster reduction conference in Jakarti, said.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he pulled the car, the fat, the house, he hit everything on the head," said Nugro and added that the tsunamis crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
"Some people went to the building to escape the tsunami and survive," he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, excavated and damaged bridges, and jemmies surrounded by water.
Last attack continued to strike that coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could have been felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its report, the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) announced that the energy released on Friday was equivalent to the two-thirds of the nuclear bombs dropped at Hiroshima in World War II.
It suggests that the geographical location of the city, located at the end of the long and dry season, may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugro's words, the number of victims and damages may be greater than 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donghe and near the epicenter of the attack.
"The communications are completely interrupted and we don't have information from Dongh. "
"More than 300,000 people live in this area," says the Red Cross report, adding that staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could be much worse," says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism because of not providing information that the tsunami hit Palau, although officials claim that waves came at the moment the warning was issued.
In a amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor is building panicously warning people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a water wall was encountered on the coast, carrying a building and a car.
The Reuters agency could not verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
Posts and tsunamis have caused a lack of electricity that has caused the communication to break around Palu, which has made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue action.
According to the authorities, it started sending tired planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but it is still necessary for food and other necessities.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until November.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunamis in Indonesia cost more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision from Donghe successfully arrived in the city of Palu where employees were placed in the tarpaulin tent at their office's court, they followed the scenes of destruction on the way," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched shouts to help in the disaster, some have claimed that foreign humanitarians with great expertise are unable to come to Palo.
According to Indonesia's funding, supply and commitment requirements from other countries can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the landscape," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster' we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been announced."
When it fell on Pala the second night from the raid and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those still considered missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that commemorate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the canal.
On Saturday, the rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days under torture near her mother's body.
Gendon Subannon, a trainer of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing parachutes for the Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those prisoners in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandanga, were his disciples.
"In view of the many years spent in parallel, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the destruction of Roa Roa Roa's hotel, which extended to the paraglider community, he suddenly sent whatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked by a gray box instead of two blue boxes.
"I think it means that messages are not sent," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 from Newport on the Levee in full-time banking.
The thieves stole 26.750 US dollars from Brink's employee, who had filled the banks in the center of Newport on the Levee on Friday, is in charge of a press release from the police department of Newport.
In a statement by Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the car has emptyed the bankate in a fun complex and prepared to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was in charge of this, the other man "came to Brin's behind the back" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the bank.
The Witnesses noticed more suspicious people running away from the scene of the robbery, but the police did not assign the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper my change in Ye
Raper Kanye West will change his name in Ye.
In his Twitter post on Saturday, in which he announced that change, he wrote: “Life will be officially known as Kanye West. ”
West (41) has an album Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight album published in June.
The change comes in the eyes of his guests at the Saturn Day Night Live show in which he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
The Emission Authors said he replaced the singer Arian Grande, who refused for "emotional reasons" in the show.
In addition to this short of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that this word has a faithful meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," West said earlier this year in a talk on the title of his album with the radio director Big Boye.
"So, it's you, it's me, it's us.
It went from Kane, which means "one", only Ye – it's a feeling of good, bad, confused, all in us.
The album itself is actually the reflection of who we are."
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but he announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And sometimes West's associate, JAY-Z, played with the versions of his name without a label and with a short and written word.
The Mexican AMLO promised not to use the army against the citizens
The candidate for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use the military force against the citizens as the country nears 50 years of blood transfusions against the students.
Lopez Obrador, on the Tlatelco market on Saturday, promised that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
The military forces fired during the peaceful demonstration on that market on 2 November 1968 and killed even 300 people at the moment when left-wing students began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening up a large number of free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of education attract young criminal gangs.
The US should double its investment in artistic intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming more and more active in the field of artistic intelligence, the US should double its investment in research in this area," said an investor in artistic intelligence and expert in the Kai Fu Leee area that worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the American government announced plans for artistic intelligence, although the US is in principle missing a formal strategy on artistic intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan: its goal is to become the first country by the number AI innovation by 2030.
"Twofold increase in the budget for research in the field of artistic intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the US and that we are looking for the next major discoveries in the field of artistic intelligence," Lee said.
"Twofold increase in investment could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artistic intelligence will reach the United States," Lee said this week in a CBC discussion.
Lee who wrote: "AI grande: China, Silicon Valley and the new world leader" this month announced the publishing house Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, the principal director of the Sinovation Ventures company that invests in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80th century, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the best American game player Othello, and later was director at Microsoft's research department and the president of the Google Chinese border.
Lee commended the previous US government's technological competition, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when to keep up next to find new audiences.
According to Lee's words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that runs the academic leader, it's corporate," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technological companies have engaged in the brightest university bids to work on researching art intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said changing immigration policies could also help the United States to intensify its efforts in the field of artistic intelligence.
"I think that doctors in the field of art intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council announced the Plan for the Development of Art Intelligence Next Generation in August 2017.
"China's National Science Fund provides financial resources to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Sciences and Other State Organisations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in the activities and academic community, and White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Art Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million annually in research in the field of artistic intelligence.
In the meantime, the American legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Art Intelligence has been no longer a burden for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing their country's names
On Saturday, Macedonian citizens voted in the referendum to change their country's name in the "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a step that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been taking place for decades and which has blocked Greece's opening of negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claiming that its name of the northern neighbour represents its territory and has introduced a pledge to enter the country into NATO and the EU.
The two governments in June agreed on a proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the state of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign to combat the vote cast doubt on whether it would be possible to meet the minimum 50 per cent necessary to make the referendum more relevant.
The question on the referendum vote list was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with agreement with Greece?"
The amendments to the call, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is a price worth paying to make Macedonia, one of the countries still after the breakup of Yugoslavia, allowed access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely within the framework of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said they would respect it in order to be considered decisive.
Changing the names requires a double majority in Parliament.
The State electoral authority stated that no irregularities were reported until 13 hours.
However, only 16 per cent of the output amounted to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a spokesman from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko, joined the referendum on 30 June 2018, which would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of the parliament in Skopje placed a little attention and received chairs in front of the tent that those who fought against the referendum had set up.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not as slaves," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO would bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, the country in which unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would represent "the confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Research Institute shows that between 30 and 43% of voters will join the referendum, which is under the necessary response.
A second survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of researchers intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said it would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the outcome must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious political impact of the Western Government since it took over its mandate in May last year.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Bridgeton defense to get hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, broke Bridgeton's defense and won for Manchester City with results 2:0.
Aguero has made the victory crazy a simple, successful hit in 65 minutes.
Argentinian attacker received an addendum in the middle of the area at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defenses and then reached the open field.
Aguero was then found surrounded by four opponent players in green shirts.
He's wearing a coat, and then he puts a few more on the bridge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to Starling.
The English attacker from the first attempt returned to the Aguero fighter, who shot a right-wing ball on the right-hand side of the network and injured Brighton's backer Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulties with the foot," the journalist reported manager Manchester City, Pep Guardian.
"We planned to play a game of 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he's been hit at the moment."
But Sterling was the one Sky Blues gave the initial advantage in the Premier League race.
That hit was achieved in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep in Brighton's field during this game.
It was wonderful to add Leroy Sane's ball to the left side.
Sane hit the ball a few times before Sterling was introduced to the station.
The Sky Blues attacker threw the ball into the net just before it crashed into the car.
Manchester City is fighting against Hoffneheim in a group game League show on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable the progress of Rockies
Since Nationals' players were eliminated from playing, there was not too much reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes to win a Sunday victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, win in playing.
The Rockies won at 5: 2 on the Nationals at least secure a place in wild card playing, but they hope to win their first title.
"Although it didn't play for anything, we could at least throw out knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other would play at the highest level that I would witness this year.
Why should I not compete with that?"
The nationals still have to publish a Sunday starter, but they are apparently willing to offer the Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who is going to make his 34th start, was burning on Thursday in the shooting room and will play on Sunday, when he usually retired.
The right from Washington in this season has achieved the result of 18 : 7, the range of winning races (ERA) from 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 double shifts.
A trumpet in West Virginia
During the talk on the importance of the appearance of Republican voters in the general election, the president commented unanimously on his selection of Bretta Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court of Justice.
"All we've done will be at the studio.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the great, great – I didn't, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
The trumpet continues: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see that is happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to neglect to take over their authority and control, so they want power and control, and we won't give them any more."
Democrats, as he says, have a mission to "suppose and deny."
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, so-called democracies "heavy, evil, corrupt and lying."
He borrowed democratic Senator Diane Feinstein from the Senate Justice Committee on behalf of the Committee on Justice, which caused the vote to be taken by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Laburist party no longer takes note of different opinions.
It does not tolerate the presence of personal items
It didn't surprise me too much when Moment's activists in my local side voted to censor me.
Finally, I'm at the top of the list of representatives of the Laburist Party who were told that they were not welcome – all because of what we said in our minds.
According to my colleague Joan Ryan, they took a similar approach because they strongly opposed antisemitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the previous leadership.
The report on the Meeting of the Laburist Party of Nottingham east of Friday stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I've been working as a local representative of the Laburist Party's meeting on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are held in a different tone, and the promise of a "lover, lower" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It has become more evident that different views do not tolerate in the Laburist side, and each opinion is evaluated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the foreign leadership.
It began soon after Jeremy became a leader, since the partners I thought we shared a similar political opinion from me began to demand a drastic change of thinking and taking into account situations that I would otherwise never agree with — whether on national security or on the single market of the EU.
Whenever I talk to the public – and actually it doesn’t matter what I say – it’s following a series of harmful words on social networks that my opposition is facing, which reject the central policy and tell me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Laburist Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had more happiness than some of my colleagues because they're comments that are directed to me mainly political.
I admire the professionality and decision-making of my colleague who are confronted every day with a range of sexual or racist comments, but they never stop.
One of the aspects of this political era that has been most disappointed with me is the tolerance of harmful speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Laburist party should influence the culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer take into account different opinions and that with every proposal on distrust or change of electoral rules, we become more congruent.
Many times in the last two years, they advised me to burn my head, not to be so loud, and they told me that then everything would be all right."
But I didn't do it in politics.
Since I joined the Laburist Party 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the Government of Margaret Thatcher, who had abandoned my school university scholarship, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most — whether as local adviser or government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham's border could have been led into a misunderstanding with regard to my political positions and the areas of non-compliance with the current leadership.
All I would like to send to those who have supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment that the country takes over Brexit, which will have a negative impact on households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Laburist Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election unit, whether it's about the members of the Laburist Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of opposition or political advantage will turn me away from acting as I think it is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undisputed Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have had an immediate effect on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this extremely interesting game of days at Tennt's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the list and the only ones are untied by the ten teams.
The latter, the upper defenses and the better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be content.
"They've been trying every game for years and we're still unsatisfied, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose's club said: "Every honor to Ayru, they've been taking better chances than us."
Try Grant Anderson in 14 minutes that did Frazier Climo brought Ayr in the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who turned the game off the Warriors, gave Melrose the chance to raise the results, and Jason Baggot used an unrealistic attempt.
Climo has increased the leadership of Ayra's monoesters before, on its own half-time, reached a fall and realized a self-sustained attempt to change the outcome for Ayr at 17:5 p.m.
But Melrose, another half-time started well and tried Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the advantage of five points.
Then came a long stop due to the serious injuries of Ruridha Knotta that they carried on the noses, and when the game continued, Ayr continued to play a good game by trying Stafford McDowall who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card and Melrose remakes an extra player to pay, and that's an unrealistic attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, came back, and when Sruan Hutchinson got a yellow card to destroy climate that had no ball; with a line for a penalty hit, MacPherson made a move behind Ayra in a full lockdown of the window.
Climo realized how it did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe had received a high hit from David Armstrong and sent the winning player Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the boys home.
Still Game series star is ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in the service activities after it has been discovered that it is designated by the director of licensed restaurants.
56-year-old player Jack Jarvisi in a favorite BBC series whose scenario is one of the stars, along with a long-term partner in comedys, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the presence of the nine seasons would be the last to be shown, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglong.
According to the official evidence, he is the director of the Adymorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan would be involved in the "increasing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will share her exit to the Pacific
The Navy patrols the marine center of a complete dilicacy in La Paz.
Public buildings have been reported to prevent ocean colors.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, but they cry: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of Chile's lost marine coast in the face of a conflict of resources in the 19th century is still alive – just as is the case with the refishing of the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice judgment expected on 1 November, following a five-year procedure, hope may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, of course, waiting for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice judge on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after more than ten calls for negotiations, will be able to negotiate a long time on the introduction of a sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
Here Morales, a Bolivian charismatic autoethnic president who is facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the trial on Monday.
"We're back again in the Pacific," he promised at the end of the colossus.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge Bolivia's benefits and that it would change little if it were.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands has no authority to share Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice comes all six months after the final hearing means that the case was "not recorded", said Paz Zárat, Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have been delayed.
"The request for access to the sea has been accepted by the current painful leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue dialogue at the same time, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged the Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in Haagu, disagrees with the fact that the court has made an unusual decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an unexpected opportunity to start a new period in relation to Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of non-compliance with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the sea issue as a political stock.
"Bolivia will never give up rights to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we need to transform the past."
North Korea said she wouldn't come to nuclear disarmament if she couldn't trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disappointed if they could not believe Washington.
Ri turned to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
Commented on the moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to have recently reopened diplomatic talks on nuclear issues, which came more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Uno.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "freedom of imagination" and that the United States' opposition to the declaration on the end of the Korean War will not leave the North on the knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pjongjang taking concrete steps to disarm it.
Kim and president of the United States Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting at the top.
But widespread scepticism on the serious purpose of Pjongjanga is to cut down the arsenals that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris’ fashion magazines reveal that the last line of great cover for the head on the road to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to advance your collection of hats or completely block the sun, do not continue.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a line of detached clouds covering their spring and summer collection in 2019 and inspired lovers of style in Paris' weekly fashion.
These extremely inactivative hats have made it into the summer of Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention to the letter.
An example that came to mind was Valentino, and it was about a large six-wheeled-six-six-cracked wide-angled piece of paper that was completely "taken" the head of the model.
The other glamorous additions included the skulls carved out of the nose, the magic hat, and even the ananas, but those supplements were not meant to break your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – dark at night for the night of the witch.
A lot of shin masks have been sealed up and made Hannibal Lecter more than high-moded pieces.
One creation created a ronic garment with a dilik and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with a heated ice cream.
Do you follow a great fashionable saying – happiness is on your side?
The stylists predict that huge caps could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The giant hats are perfectly joined by the "La Bomba", a wooden hat with a width of about 60 cm, seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanne to Emily Rattakowski.
The cultural slavery market behind the extremely ineffective hat that has broken down social networks on the modal was another great creation – a fragile beach bag almost as much as a mannequin in the bought suit she wore.
Sagasito orange bag of raffia, decorated with raffic resins and white skin gloves, was an example in the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 in Paris' weekly fashion.
Stylist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told the F.D.: "I expect large beach hats and bags in luxury shops for the next year. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the search for big blue supplements."
John Edward: Language skills that citizens of the world need
Scotland's independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding results, and this adds to the weight that gives individual and joint success in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school that represents the Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is trying to provide the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools have the goal of preparing students for further education and higher education, a career that they want to make and make for citizens of the world.
As the educational sector that can design and implement that school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be preferred and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you turn to a man who understands the language, it goes into his head.
If you turn to his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final survey show that the highest estimates in languages have achieved the dropouts of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages received excellent evaluations.
Data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent assessment in Mandarin, while 72% of students who teach German, 69% of students who teach French, and 63% of students who also learn Spanish also received the highest possible assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as electoral objects are considered as important as STEM objects (knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17 % of employees cannot fill jobs due to the lack of labour force with language skills.
So language skills are becoming more and more imperatives for the preparation of young people for careers.
Since more and more jobs are required to know the language, the skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of careers, those who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long - term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can directly communicate with foreigners, which gives her the advantage in relation to competition.
According to a survey by the Organisation of YouGov in 2013, more than 4,000 adults participated, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know enough language to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks bilingually about the percentage of respondents, 15% more precisely.
So investing in language learning is very important to children today.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland every school offers different languages.
Some schools will set up classic, modern languages in their program, while others will decide for languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, in independent schools, there will always be a variety of choices, as well as an upbuilding staff who is skilled in this area.
Scottish independent schools allow children to learn to prepare and equip their skills for success regardless of what the future holds for us.
It cannot be ignored that in today’s global business, language knowledge is very important for the future of each country so that it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, the knowledge of modern languages should indeed be seen as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
You have to do it.

LeBron will first dance in Lakers' dress on Sunday in San Diego.
Navigators will soon wait for the first LeBron James for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first pre-session game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," said Walton to Lakers' official.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell posted a tweet that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training this week, James answered questions about his plans for a presidential in Lakers, which consists of six games.
"In this phase, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump maintains a team in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign with numerous groups tonight in Wheeling in West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned groups to hold Trump next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for future elections because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose most of the Congress after voting in the student.
How many hours does the Trompo gathering start in West Virginia, and how can you look at it on the network?
Trump's collection in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours after the east time, tonight, on Saturday, 29th June 2018.
Trump's collection in West Virginia can be viewed online by streams alive on YouTube.
The trumpet will probably comment on this week's hearing of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh's candidates who have challenged the police for a sexual abuse charge. The Senate's firm decision to wait is already a week until the FBI's investigation is completed.
However, the primary objective of this series is to help the Republicans achieve the choice of students.
Therefore, from Trump's presidential champions, five groups banned for the next week have "stimulating volunteers and accessions because the Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority of the people in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Most in Congress is so important to the presidents' plans that they will travel to more countries as we enter the burn campaign," said Reuters anonymous spokesman Trump's campaign.
The evening gathering that will be held in Wesbanco Areni in Wheeling could attract accessions from "Ohija and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh", reports West Virginia Metro News.
The trumpet will visit West Virginia the second time in the past month. In 2016, the country won more than 40 percent points.
The troops are trying to help the candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who remains in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve his research rank," Politologist Simon Haedar from the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018.: The U.S. team left the heart on the ground before individual rounds on Sunday
After three weeks of one session, the couple's breaking up on Sunday, maybe it's exactly what was supposed to turn Ryder Cup.
"About luck turns around" is a term that is especially valuable in sports and which sports believe, especially in competitions like this.
Who's the lucky bike now forced?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So, I think happiness is on our side right now," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are in favour of four points, while there are still 12 points to the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouragement of his game in pairs with Justin Thomas, with which three of the four points won after the entire day's game.
Spieth played a killer from tea to grass and can serve as an example to others.
Navigating celebrations became more louder when Spieth and Thomas arrived at two remaining points, and all culminated in the key trip that Spieth reached to the unsolved result.
After the path he won the game with 15 holes, he followed a similar navigational clock in which hope can be recognized and believed that Americans can all turn around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
The team's just left with the players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spietha and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cupa's sensation.
The European wonder, but the unfathomable couple has a maximum number of points and can't make mistakes.
"Molywood" is the only couple who didn't lose the bod on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back it on Friday morning.
That winning line, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, shows that they are exactly the players who should win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can guarantee the victory of the Europeans while the sun lies above the Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe both will bring victory at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about the European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly arranged Alexa Norena and Sergey Garcija who had a great performance in tomorrow's pairs game.
One bogey and two double bogies on the first nine holes in the game hall buried Spain and Sweden in a hole they couldn't dig out.
However, on Sunday there will be no one who will help individuals get out of their holes.
It's fascinating to look at the pairs' games nearby because you can see the interaction of players in a couple, hear the advice they give and those who don't give, and study the strategy that can change at the moment.
Europeans have already played better as a team, and on the last day they come in with a significant preference, but this game in pairs has shown that the US team has a need to fight, in which some, especially the states, have doubted.
Europeans on the last day of Ryder Cup with leadership from 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday games in pairs on the last day of Ryder Cup come with a significant advantage over the US from 10 : 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods took four points different to Le Golf National.
The European boy Thomas Bjorna is trying to win the trophies that he won in Hazeltina two years ago was stronger than the American boy in the morning game in the couple's couple's real results from 3: 1.
The American boy showed more struggle in pairs than two games, but the difference in points has already been great.
To win the trophies of a boy Jim Furyk, eight points should be collected in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debater from the European boy who won four points in advance, while he and Molinari are known as "Molliwood", after a sedentary weekend only another couple who won four points in the games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After they defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they showed themselves powerful in the game against Woods and American debater Bryson Dechambeau won 57-4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Sundays did some brilliant moves, but now he's got 19 matches from 29 games in the Fourballs and the pairs and seven shots in the yard.
Justin Rose was watching tomorrow's fourballs to get back to play with Henry Stones' partner and experience the defeat of 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans didn't go exactly as well as the underprivileged during a pleasant day in the southeastern of Paris.
Trotastic winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points a week and thus put the flag high on their American boy.
First, they defeated Spanish Jona Rahma and Iana Poultera as a result of 2&1 in the Fourballs, and then they defeated Poultera and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in the pairs after the first two holes were lost.
Twice in the entire story of Ryder Cup, a boy who was in the rest of the four points successful back in a single game, although Fury's boy needs only an unsolved result to keep the trophies.
After two days in the rest of the day, they seem to be having a hard day's fight.
North Korea stated that "no chance" for a single divorce without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday before the United Nations that further sanctions increase distrust in the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will be suddenly dissolved and abandoned by nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea has committed "significant measures of good will" last year," for example stopped nuclear and rocket tests, demoralized the nuclear stand for testing and made a decision to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't believe in the United States, we don't believe in our national security, and under such circumstances, there's no way we're going to disappoint ourselves first."
Although Ri has reiterated the known allegations of North Korea against Washington's "progressive" access to denuclearization within which North Korea would progressively withdraw the sanctions, his statement is significant because he has not rejected the unilateral denuclearization of how Pjonjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trumpa at the first meeting in the US and North Korea's current president and leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the "Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has pledged that Pjongjang would withdraw nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls for a reduction of severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization is preceded by increased pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective strongly, and even counter "declaration of the end of the war", Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can cast us on our knees is only a mistake of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri has not mentioned whether there are plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump, which the president of the United States spoke about in the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in held even three meetings in the last five months and added: "If South Korea had been looking for denuclearization instead of the United States, the Korean peninsula's denuclearization would not have come to such a stand."
Regardless of everything, the tone of speech Minister Riya was quite different from last year when he spoke in front of the UN General Assembly and said that the goal of the continental US rockets was inevitable after the bad President Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
The storm that has threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea this year has praised Kim in the United Nations for her courage to disarm, but has added that they are waiting for much more work and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
The Tempp said in the middle that there is no time frame for denuclearization and added: “It doesn’t matter whether it will last for two years, three years or five months. ”
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should pay Pjongjang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo Council for Security of the United Nations said on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue very hard until the complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Riy at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongjang again the following month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not passed well.
He left Pjongjang in Serbia and said he had made progress, but North Korea called him after several hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea agreed to a meeting with Moon this month to detonate a rocket location and a nuclear complex that will take place if the United States of America accepts "responsive measures".
He added that Kim discovered that these "relevant measures" relate to the security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilization of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard go on a course to learn how to relax well
The new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in an effort to fight against the increasingly culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academics have found that students at the world’s best universities often have no idea of the basis of concern for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, suggested a course for which he considered to be the first class in the United States.
The idea of a course came after he kept talking about the effect of depressing sleep on learning.
At the end of the talk, one girl approached me and said: “Why did I find this out just now, in the last year of my college? ”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course that is held for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health, Paul Barreira, says the University has decided to introduce a course following a serious lack of sleep during the week in students.
A simple course consists of a range of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of student bedrooms where students need to click on cupcakes, candles, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how low dreams affect the success and how important sleep routine is.
Students also learn how long - term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown to the students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride for lifelong learning before the study continues to exist, says Professor and adds that modern technology and the growing pressure on students prove that there is a lack of sleep on all the major problems.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, obesity and pregnancy should be a good and quality dream. Sleeping also helps to fight depression because a lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in the condition of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler to figure out the course after his lecture on Harvard's first year.
He says the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to expand the course throughout the camp.
As a next step, he plans to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study item before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students include an alarm during sleep, as well as during wakefulness. They need to be aware of the harmful effects of "white light" that emits the secrets of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can interfere with circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Get a gol porazione Gerardov boy
The Rangers suffered one more defeat after Dolly Menge's fall defeated the minor defense of Steven Gerrard and finished the game of winning Livingstone with the result 1 :0.
The guy from Ibrox wanted to win the first win in the guest post trijump in the winner and results 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but the guy Gary Holt caused Gerard's second defeat in 18 games, so his boy now remains eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga arrived seven minutes ago, and the Rangers seemed to be gone without inspiration, and it didn't seem to match the result.
While the Rangers are now falling into six places, Livingston fell to the third with just one story different behind the Hibernate.
It could come to new problems for Rangers after a line judge called Calum Spence got his head hurt when he was shot from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on his cheeks and thus crossed beyond Ayra to half-fina Bethfred's cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingstone set that he had taken action last week and would have been thrilled to see his well thought-in-law being exaggerated every attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more balls in their possession, but Livingston got more with it.
They had an opportunity for the event for two minutes after Menga was first expelled from the game that Scott Pittman opened the space to move towards the naked Allan McGregor, however, the relative missed this opportunity.
Deep-free Keaghan Jacobs hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense officer Alan Lithgow could only follow an inaccurate hit on the back of the guards.
At one point the Rangers took control, but at the end of the third game, they seemed to play with hope instead of confidence.
Alfredo Morelos must have thought that his judge should have sentenced him to a uniform in 15 minutes after his trial with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not apply to Columbia.
The Rangers were in the first half of the time successful to lead only two bullets to the floor, but the former Ibrox door to Liam Kelly's one hit on Lassane Coulibaly's head and the hits of Ovie Ejaria were not a big problem.
Although Livingstone's 34-minute entertainment slowed the game, no one can make it hard for them.
The Rangers have again failed to use the deep Jacob's return ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the bat to Scott Robinson, who was holding possession and chose Mengo for the simple end of the attack.
Gerrard responded during the strike and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement had almost had a current effect because the wing player added the Morolos ball, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his lines.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to exactly the kind of game they enjoy while Lithgow and Halkett made a long hit for each other.
Holt's side could provide guidance at the end of the moment, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide escape from the castle.
Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton was looking for one more time because he was dating Jacobs, but Thomson and this time he turned his eyes off.
Almanah: Immigrants of Geigerov's Broker
And now follows our Almanah page on Sunday Morning issue: 30th June 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and later developed a device known as Geiger's number.
The main center of science since then, Geiger's number has also become the main observatory of culture, such as in the 1950's "Bells of Colorado" film, where the main role was seen by the incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man says, "What is this, God?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s computer, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these audiences, you can actually hear atoms that respond to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans says, "Look at this, it's really listening!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the stranger who bears his name lives on.

A new cancer vaccine can teach immunological system to "see" bad stations and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches an immunological system that, as part of the treatment, it recognises bad stations
The procedure includes removing the immunological system station from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
The cells are treated to "recognise" the protein that is common to many cancers and then re-enter the patient
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immunological system to recognize a bad station, the cancer of an egg was withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of the immune system from the patient, their replacement in the laboratory, so that they can "recognise" the protein called HER2, which is common to many cancers and re-incineration.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in the city of Bethesda in the federal state of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 leads to growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing the immunological system cells from the patient and their "learning" to identify cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after visiting the issue Saturday night Live, joined in the discussion on Trump and supported it by wearing a cap with the title "Let's make America big again".
It's not a good time.
Kanye West graduated from a study during a Saturday Night Live show after a riot in which US President Donald Trumpa praised and announced he would be running for the president of 2020.
After performing the third song on the name Ghost Town during which he wore a cap with the title "Let's make America big again", he continued to talk against democracy and he resumed to support Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they tell me, how you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I'm worried about racism, I'd be moving from America a long time ago," he said.
The issue of Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon ridiculed the testimony of Bretta Kavanaugh before the U.S. Court of Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's claims for sexual abuse.
Although she wasn't evicted, Westo's video on the social network was passed by Commissioner Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock was trying to order West with the release.
Also, West was angry with the public that behind his glances were prepping for the hat he wore.
"They hated me behind their backs.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that captain."
They betrayed me!
They said I've moved up," carried Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see down?" and he said he'd take off his Superman's fear because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
The magazine Variety wrote that his comments at least twice called for public neglect, and the members of the issue Saturday Night Live got ashamed, while one person for the magazine said, "The whole studio was silent."
West was invited at the last moment as a replacement for singer Arian Grande, who was an ex-boyfriend, reper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
West is the performance of the song "I love it", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, set many up.
Westa supported Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who announced on Twitter: "One of the most beautiful people: Thank you for what you're doing with Mafia."
However, the director of Karen Hunter's Twitter show said that West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward anyone (by collecting his music, clothing or by supporting his "art") for whom I believe to accept and spread the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying he will now be "officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Didy's steps, also known as Puff Didy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Reper Snoop Dogg, called Snoop Lion, and of course, the music legend Prince changed his name in symbol, and then in an artist known as Prince.
The charge of trying to kill a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with trying to kill a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred in Ballyhackmore.
The defendant should appear before the Criminal Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be discussed by the prosecutor.
The stars of the series Game of the Kit Harington Ringington raced on toxic matrices
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snowa, who is playing a ball in HBO's violent medieval fantasy game of history.
But a 31-year-old player got caught up in a stereotype of a hero's cat, saying that because of such television roles, children often feel that they have to be firm enough to get respect.
In a discussion on the list of The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxicity in #MeToo eri.
Kit, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague, Rose Leslie from the game series, admitted that she wanted to "very determined" face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where have we been wrong with men?" he asked.
"What have we learned from these men as they grew up, in relation to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male figures on screens, could be partly responsible for increasing toxicity.
He continued: “What has been born, and what has been learned?
What do you learn from TV and on the streets, and that kids feel that they have to have certain black men?
I think it is actually one of the big questions of our time — how can we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the boys.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not record the game series settings after its end of the next summer and said that he was "completed with soldiers and horses".
From the student Kit will play in the new performance of the true West exhibition by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother crying.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that getting to know his wife, Rose, was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of the game.
"I met my wife recording this series, which gave me my family and life," he said.
Rose was in a fantastic series that won the prize of Emmy played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kitto's son, Jon Snow.
A couple married in June 2018 to the family of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase in new cases of disease from 14%
China reported that 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS had increased by 14%.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted by sex, which has been changed in relation to the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly across some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, the health authorities said that the person who is infected with HIV in this way is still missing.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV virus to sex is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been criminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is a big person.
Studies estimate that 70–90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry women due to conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relationships occur because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV in 2003.
Maxine Waters argues that a member of the public has access to data about the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "trust theories"
American representative Maxine Walters said on Saturday that a member of her staff published personal data from three Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages.
A democratic representative from Los Angeles believes that the claim spreads the "ultra right wing" as well as web sites.
"Talk, lie and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual access of the candidate of the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after the three senators were investigating Kavanaugh.
Conservative Web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of this information belongs to the Waters representative's office, as well as information on the staff member's representative, have reported the news of The Hill.
"These unambiguous instructions are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and unsubstantial instructions - is not responsible for the processing of these data.
These unambiguous instructions are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the Internet, including an ex-conspirator of the White House of Arija Flechesera.
"This is a mad joke," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temperature to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he hasn't done should not be angry.
It shouldn't be boring.
He must not examine the motives of the prosecutor.
It has to be calm and stable."
It was thought that Fleischer compared Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticisms that the Democrats led to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in general elections against Waters, also announced on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Waterss, in his statement, stated that her office had informed “the international body and governing bodies of the order” about these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they have legal consequences for all the work that is harmful and dangerous for my entire office," she continued.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Responsibilities" – insufficiently interesting Rowan Atkinson struggle against spying
Now it is already common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is also in the new exhibition of the Johnny English Action Series, which was the first follow-up called "Johnny English" in 2003 and returned to the big screen with the title "Johnny English again".
Will the content of our own satisfactory about how worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Incapacitated Johnny English has again permission to complicated the situation, while his name says more than anything about a chemical creation for a wide audience designed for a country where cinematography is not in English.
He is, of course, a secret agent who, despite his strange claims on the "distributed" flame of remembrance to Inspector Clouseau, has a character character Mr. Beana and then a reminder to the boy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 launch ceremony of the London Olympic Games.
His character was also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man who once played Atkinson in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who's driving a cab.
There's one or two nice moments in this latest film release.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in the middle of the year, and when the propeller suddenly hit his helmet.
It is visible atkinson's talent for a physical comedian, but humor tends to be quite uninterestable and unusual, especially now when "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Unable Mission" are offered by itself.
Humor is thought to be intended for children, not adults, and I think Johnna English's stories are not so innovative and focused as those of Atkinson's gegos are not influenced by Mr. Bean's appearance.
The idea that Britain is in serious trouble is now a common factor.
Hacker entered the nearest British spy web network and discovered the identity of all British agents, at the horror of an agent on duty, who unfortunately recently appeared playing Kevin Eldon.
This has crossed the prime minister's patience, overcrowded, and warlike life-threatening system because it's politically restricted: Emma Thompson is trying to show a person who should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get a material to do with.
The intelligence consultants will find out that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the deceased agent.
And this person will be an unattended Johnny English head and shoulder who is currently employed as a director of some remote school, but then he learns how to become a secret agent: there are several comfortable gegos here because English teaches spying in rocker style.
English quickly brings into the government space at an emergency meeting where he will meet again with Boughho, his ex-partner and his eternal victim, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an enthusiast commander of the submarine that plays Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely absorbed.
And so the two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who are doing all the wrong are returning to the action and meeting a beautiful fatal woman, Opheli Bullet, who was inspired by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the poor Jason Volte who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous events: destroyed in the conobar fires an abandoned French restaurant, the challenge of a huge messing around on the Voltin luxury yacht, and English challenges the entire anarchy trying to use the audience for virtual reality to find out how it looks in the interior of the Voltine house.
Everything has been designed to fit for this last step, but whatever the film was attractive and competitive, it still contains a half of the children's elements.
It's a pretty central achievement.
And as was the case with other movies about Johnny English, I once again wondered if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would fit his talent?
The Laburist party recommends that they develop a plan for the British to work four days a week, and they will be paid in five days
The labist partner Jeremiah Corbina will consider a radical plan for which the British would work four days a week and be paid for the five-day work.
The party claims that the head of the company's employees will pursue a successful revolution of art intelligence (AI) and give them an additional day of freedom.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources suggest that the idea could be "entered" into a foreign economic programme and plans for the country to devote itself to the interests of workers.
The syndicated convention is a four-day week shift as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
High source from the Laburist Party said for the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not take place overnight, but it is a burden that is adapted to the approach this party has to keep the economy balanced for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Laburist Party would not be the first to give its support to such an idea, since the Green Party promised four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Laburist party does not fully accept this burden.
The Laburist Party's voter stated: "The four-day working week is not a party's policy and the party does not consider it."
The shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used a previous conference of the Laburist Party to discuss his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to overrun the power from "individual managers" and "profeter" in municipal businesses.
The plans of the offices in the shadow also mean that the current shareholders in the water business may not be able to return their overall role because the Laburist government could make "reimburses" on the basis of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include a worker in the Administrative Board of Companies and to create inclusive own funds so that 10 per cent of private companies' capital would be paid to employees, which would generate an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's research on Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh has finally resulted in a vote by his Supreme Court candidate for at least a week and raises the question whether the closure of the agency can affect the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was issued on Sunday, the writer "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any chance that the FBI would find out something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy thought he was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said go to the discussion, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugho.
I called him after it happened, after your instructions were issued, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, uncompromising, unintended."
Graham's voice, however, like it's stuck in the rock.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and really should be a strong accusation to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett was completely disappointed," Graham added, thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the person she named could confirm her claim.
It's been 36 years since.
I don't see anything has changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has anything been achieved on poverty reduction?
On Saturday, New York will be hosted by the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive description of the star and the same impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For seven years, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the implementation of stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, was the Global Poverty Project project, the international focus group in hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to obtain an event free entrance (except if they were not willing to pay the VIP entrance), concert visitors had to perform tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending e-mail to world leaders, telephone calls or any other meaningful way of raising the news about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen actually been in view of his 12 years of achieving the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to convince people to call for action, or just another case such as "clickivism" – where people feel that signing online petitions or sending tweets really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed that it has marked more than 19 million "actions" of its accessions that have made it difficult to achieve a range of objectives.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to declare commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of $37 billion that will have an impact on lives by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had made 390 commitments and notifications that had emerged from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and operators in the United Kingdom, which seeks to "help children to develop their full potential", with the promise that, following the adoption of more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world, Rwanda will provide $35 million to help Ruandi with the goal of completing employment in this area.
"With the help of the governments of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice becomes only a fuse in history," said Tracey Ulman, the founder of the "The Power of Nutrition", published at a London concert in January 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5000 actions undertaken with the aim of improving food for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project to ensure food intervention for 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
“ It will be a long and difficult time, ” answers the Global Citizen.
But we will succeed, as they have succeeded and great steps for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because we are stronger together.
The events of Janet Jackson, Weekda, Shawna Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belong to some events in this year's event in New York that will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports from being used by the Ministry of Internal Affairs
Washington can, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, according to weekly Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's engagement in Syria was especially there where he works at the legitimate government's invitation to apologize for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe that Russia is the reason why it is in the Middle East that it wants to sell energy in this area as it does in Eastern Europe, south of Europe," he says.
But, according to his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of seafarers, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy is not marketed," he said.
The markets were addressed to participants at an event in which the host was a useless group of Consumer Energy Alliance, represented in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's access to Russia and Iran, pointing out how they actually did the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less utilizing and replacing fuels," he said, and for Russia it says that "the same trick" is used in the economies of the fossil fuels.
Statements were made at the same time with the intention of Trump's administration to increase its exports of natural gas in Europe, which would replace Russia with a far more cheap option for European consumers.
In this sense, officials of the Trump administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project (Northern Stream 2), which, according to Trumpu, made Berlin "farben" Moscow.
Moscow stressed in more detail that the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double existing gas water capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the severe opposition to the Washington project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of executing pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in June.
The U.S. station has caused a reaction by Germany which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the United States to close the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country comes to our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angele Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really consider" the possibility of candidateing for president of 2020, says the Senator of the Union of Massachusetts.
The Senate of the Federal State of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that the candidate will be "seriously considered" after the mid-year election.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking she was a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, and that means a woman on her head," said The Hill.
"After the 6th study, I will seriously consider whether I can apply for a president."
Warren drew up an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying that "this country leads in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about Donald Trump doing our democracy," she said.
Warren was openly criticised by Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren says: "Of course we need the FBI's investigation before voting."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren's voters do not think they should apply for 2020.
According to a study by the Center for Political Research of the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that senators should not apply.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed increased support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidates, with 38% vote for a potential candidate and 48% against.
The remaining names of the Democrats discussed in relation to the potential race for President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders were discussed in 2020.
Beden said he'd make an official decision by September, the Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palina at Donald Trumpa
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after he entered the grave.
He was arrested and charged for a family violence incident that occurred on Monday night.
"What my son goes through, what goes through after his return, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSP and other wounds our soldiers return," said the audience of Donald Trump in Tulsi, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that was heard about and for his son and other war veterans said that "they return a little different, they return to their homeland, they return, asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, and all the other members of the army have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilli, Alaska, and charged with family violence against women, the arrest of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police department of the city of Vasille.
18 federal countries and D.C. support the review of new asylum policies
Eight countries and the Columbia District support the legal challenges of a new US policy that reduces asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or violence in the family.
The representatives of the 18 federal states and districts made a friendly report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is opposed to politics, reports the NBC News.
Many names of prosecutors in the Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Union for Civil Liberties has committed in a coup against federal policy, have not been found.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" violated, but US officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Greece described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers are coming, such as countries facing environmental problems with gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the decision of the Committee on Immigration of the year 2014 to which immigrants who do not have documents and who avoid violence in the family are allowed to apply for asylum.
The state attorney in Colombia, Karl Racine, said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, Union and international law".
"The federal law finds that all asylum applications are resolved on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the complaint, and such a ban violates this principle," says a friend of the court's report.
Lawyers further argued that a policy that reduces immigrants' income would damage the American economy, asserting that it would be more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to ensure the necessary labour force".
The chief state attorney, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from family violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their home because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," the Sessions said in their report on politics on 11 July.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all problems . . . even all serious problems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of victims doubles in the race for survivors
The situation was all too difficult for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her little boy who moved into the graveyard in an evacuation center in the abandoned city of Palu.
"She moved in an emergency to help every minute of the body's import.
The government condemns clean water."
The inhabitants are seen coming back to their destroyed homes, counting through the flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by 7.5 degrees, were cramps.
Some of the injured, including Dwia Harisa, who suffered from back and shoulders, were released in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated in an open hospital because of persistent subsequent attacks.
His tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of violent harassment that hit the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"It wasn't time to save ourselves.
I think I was trapped inside the ruins of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city to marry.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then she followed the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "infractions" through "propagandistic declarations"
A week after the official Chinese newspapers published four long news pages in an American daily list that promoted the considerable benefit of US and China, an American ambassador in China accused Beijing of breaking the US press for spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump turned to a paid addendum in China Daily in the most sold newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after he accused China of wanting to join the American Congressal Election on 6 November, which China rejects.
The drumpo's claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American election was noted by American officials in the Reuters statement as a new phase of the Washington campaign to execute pressure on China.
Although it is normal for governments to place commercial promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently closed in a scalable trading war that has led to high import tariffs.
The Chinese withdrawals from the start of the trade war were designed to strike exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican side, Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former former governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Peking betrayed American workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the weekly edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad says that China "now doubles this abuse by launching propaganda messages in our own free press."
"By expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find limited votes against the streets of Beijing on the kitchen for news on the streets and you will not see any real impact of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic journey because the media are under strict pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most impressive Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what the news was about.
In the wake of Kavanaugh's debate, the Republicans have distanced the voters from the mid-year elections, warning analysts
Since many Republicans are with a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and defend him by making several references to sexual abuse, analysts warn how this will lead to negative reactions during the present mid-year elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were also alarmed, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to vote.
Such things can't come back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Maxwell in Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed his doubts that the latest insinuation of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) to conduct a FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday ← won't forget it either tomorrow, nor in the studio," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a top consultant and a national speaker of the progressive movementOn group, reports a newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the witnesses sang, "Come the students!", pointing out in the Senate hall, while the Republicans in charge of the Legal Committee prepared to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Emotion and motivation of democracy will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a foreign political analyst.
"People say they're already at high level, which is true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women in urban and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although not interested in the president, often don't vote."
Even prior to the public testimony of Fords, in which its allegations of sexual assault by a candidate for the Supreme Court have been described in detail, analysts report that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's a real collection for the Big Old Page," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, starting last week, told NBC News.
"It is not only about voting in the committee or final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh has been sent to the record club, but also about the way the Republicans have responded to all this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the Organization of Priorities USA, a group that helps in the democratic election.
However, it seems that the Americans are already divided about who they will believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more pressure on him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the investigator is definitely or is likely to believe in the reality of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they believe in Kavanaugh safe or reliable.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh thought he was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Fordov.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has issued, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborom Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
The forum witnessed before the Senate Court of Justice over the past week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's judge showed his genitalia during a study at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Artist Plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, runs a new company that aims to become a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of the Berners-Lee' open platform Solid.
Solid enables users to choose a place to store their data and people who will be allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee found out how the intention behind the Inrupt "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said thinking at the start.
"This is a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data network storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, commitment lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data is that it is a decision on who can access any information completely from users.
The company calls it "the personal data-testing".
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's Chief Executive Director, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lea, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, a number of engineers who signed a contract for work on the project, as well as the community of volunteers.
Starting this week, developing engineers around the world have been able to produce their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they will make a complete change in which all their business models would turn around all night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of new networks built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded World Wide Web concerts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Last month Berners-Lee had a powerful voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even as the Inrupt starts, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and manager of the World Wide Weba Consortium, the World Wide Web Fund and the Institute of Open Data.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next network issue," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy from World War I with the Victorian Cross · Global Voices
The celebration in the honour of the only Anglican Church priest who is distinguished by the Victorian Cross as a warrior in World War I was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Major Bernard Vann won the prize on 29th June 1918 in an attack on Bellengles and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a rapist and never knew he had the greatest honor in the British war.
The monumental stone discovered two of his grandsons in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone would be discovered about 100 years after his grandfather's act for which he had received this recognition.
According to a report by the London Gazette official, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the canal of St. Quentina “through a very nice clay and under a strong fire which came from the direction of the war field and machine. ”
Later, he attacked first ranks and led the march ahead, but without any help, he pushed on a pole and hit three out of the military line.
Colonel Vanna killed the German army officer on 4 November 1918. There was something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's works were "something I know I could never achieve, and that provokes humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also put the widow after the parade, which led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to participate in the paradise" and added that "the courage of the true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Lovers of mixed fighting skills stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Praščia Peppu.
Imagine this staying awake all night to watch the fall of Bellator 206 so that you will eventually be unable to follow the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main note, and in Great Britain, they showed themselves alive at night on channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's sword, viewers in Great Britain were left in shock when the transfer stopped Praščić Peppa.
Many were not impressed after only getting up until early morning hours because of the fighting.
One lover described the breaking of the transfer to a child’s cell on Twitter as “a kind of disease. ”
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for emission at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a child programme," said Dave Schwartz, the senior marketing and communication vice president of Bellatora, when they asked him about the transfer.
"Jupi, "Ask Peppa."
The president of Bellator, Scott Cooker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include viewers from Great Britain in the future.
"When I consider reprising, I think we can probably fix something," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there in the morning at 6:00 a.m. and we won't be able to realize anything until we arrive on Sunday, when it's already Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transfer is interrupted, there's a lot of prescriptions that aren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
The problem is state nature.
I can promise you the next time you come to that.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six what else we're doing, and we're trying to give more of our fans, but we're overstepping.
"There are unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sex
An Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority in relation to others because of his sexuality but that gave him motivation to be successful.
Twenty - two - year - old said that until he went to high school, he was not aware that “not all are like me. ”
In his statement on Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals in order to give others "a hope."
He also said his victory at the Olympic Games was less important since he became a father.
The regular director of a long-term emission, Kirsty Young, took several months of rest because of the disease.
As a dropout in the first Leverine Emission, Daley said that while growing up, he felt "lower" in relation to others because "he wasn't socially acceptable to love and boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, you feel inferior and different about others were the real things that gave me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He says he wanted to prove that he was "someone and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A two-year winner of the Bronze Olympic medals has become an attractive person who is involved in LGBT and has used his initiative at this year's Game of Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he thought he was happy that he could live openly and without consequences and because he wanted to give others “a hope. ”
Trotsuki's world leader said he was surprised that he fell in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013.
Daley married a ministerial servant, 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that his differences in years never posed a problem.
"When so young you go through so much" â turned to your first Olympic game when he was 14 years old, and his father died three years later â said it was difficult to find someone in the same year and to experience similar successes and failures.
In June they became parents to the son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspectives" changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they got tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be first," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he stretched out, and only then when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not inevitable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympic Games in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I knew it was just what I had been dreaming about all my life to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, it wasn't a better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to choose the first song "Proud" by the poet Heather Small , who was raised in it during the preparation for the Olympic Games and who is always on it .
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson outside the club on Ryder floor on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back completely in order to avoid an unpleasant transition.
Mickelson, who, in this two-year-old contest game, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the club on Saturday with four volts and fours.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as was often for the United States, the five-year winner spent the day in swimming and playing his games at the stadium hoping to correct his suffering.
Never the most accurate player, not even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National field, where long-term unfair ground routine punishment strikes indiscriminately.
And if I'm not afraid enough, Mickelson is in the ninth match on Sunday facing the exact first British Open Francescom Molinari, who won the new Tommy Fleetwood in all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, arrive at the hot start, Michaelson's game could be shown absolutely key.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man 0.000 more than that and he couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, signed me on my back, buried me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"There's a lot of self-reliance."
He's famous and brought a lot of teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't mean to play two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it turned out and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be in the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will stop Nick Falda's record on Sunday for the number of games played by Ryder.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder's race that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 stakes and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence has brought certain material values into it.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for that," he explained.
"I think the young players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than the game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage can be made in the last day of the individual Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The dance was held in the sword in Valderrami in 1997, where Captain Seve Balleteros' team had the advantage of five points in relation to the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a sharp difference from 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrami; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but with a slight difference," Bjorn said, in a picture, after watching the 2018 match, which won the score of 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday led to 10 to 6 results on Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play with full power.
Get out of the field and do everything you need.
Nothing's done until it's declared on board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophie, and that remains the focus.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we're quite aware who's standing against us 0% the biggest players in the world."
Encouraged by the progress of his players in the hard golf field, Bjorn added: “I would never run in this direction before the cold.
It's about to meet another animal tomorrow.
Tomorrow's the main individual events, and that's something different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're there as an individual, eventually your ability to play golf is tested.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, and it's that they have to give the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your shirt, for he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleagues on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask their players to play better individually than they played with the Suitras, excluding Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk and I were on both sides of these big movements of the last days, since he was part of the winning boys in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe did "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," said Ben Crenshaw in response to the question of how the captain of 1999 encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that plane moves in a certain direction, it puts a big pressure on the middle of the ball.
In accordance with that, we organized our position and put the boys in place as we will, you know, try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main fight, and Paul Casey, Justine Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I've decided this group of guys is going through this mess because I think it's covering everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship again set to wait
The latest freshest German warships should be released in the spring of 2014 in order to replace the old warships during the cold war, but will not be ready until the next year due to unjust systems and increased costs, local media have reported.
The release of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead of the completely new class of Baden-Wuertmberg frigates, is now due to the first half of 2019, reports a list of Die Zeit pointing out as a military speaker.
The ship was supposed to join the Marines in 2014, but worrying problems after the shipment hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four classes of Baden-Wuertmenberg, which the Navy has ordered yet in 2007, will replace the old frigates of Bremen.
As it is known, it will have a powerful top, a series of counter-attacks and anti-corruption rockets, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer period of maintenance η should be possible to distribute the latest frigates during the period up to two years without a return to the mother’s womb.
However, permanent defeat means that the most modern warships are to be said to enable Germany to demonstrate its foreign powers to the moment of its entry into service to become old, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate came to all the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to leave the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss building in Hamburg.
This is the first time the mariner returned the ship to the ship builder after the shipment.
It was a little known about the reasons for the return, but German media identified a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make warship useless if they were sent to the battle mission.
The software deficits were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertertenberg class ships will manage the property of about 120 seafarers less than on the older Bremen class frigates.
It also showed that the ship is a dramatic burden that reduces its effectiveness and limits the marine ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tonnes is twice the weight of ships of similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the unfair hardware, the price of the whole project Õ including the training of the crew also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Committee on Defence, admitted that the Navy actually "is leaving ships capable of disbanding".
The officer said that this problem was growing in time, because the old ships were put out of port, and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of the classes of Baden-Württemberg can join the sailors.
The National Foundation is listening to the secret life of the moose
New research conducted on property in Scotland’s Highland is aimed at discovering how swirls use land for food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behaviour of these single flight crews and help in conducting future maintenance activities.
Studies carried out by scientists in the Scottish National Fund (NTS) will follow the usual and powerful pathogens of skimishes, as well as the smells of long-term and river skimishes in the Inverwe gardens in West Ross.
Special recordings will be placed at key locations around the property to follow up the smoother activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using manual detectors.
The random analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the noise and what type of noise it does.
Then there will be a map of the station and the report to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, an NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the results will be found which areas are the most important for skims and how they are used by all kinds of people.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work on the management of the stations, such as the creation of leaves and how to maintain the forest surfaces for skimishes and other related species.
The population of the Swiss people in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the past century.
They threaten buildings and works on the device that affect the shelters and the loss of the apartment.
Air turbines and radiation can also pose a threat, as well as muscle and certain chemical treatments of construction material, and attacks by cat pets.
The Shishmi are not really blind.
However, because of their custom of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated ecosystem technology to find bubbles and obstacles on their flight.
NTSC, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, understands it very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, logistic inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for skiers in Scotland on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten species of skimishes that form Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says property is an ideal area for them.
"We have a huge area here in Thrace," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old buildings and all the good buildings.
However, there is still much we don't know about the mooses, so the work we do here and on other objects will help us better understand what they need for progress."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of the cold before the work on the maintenance inside the building, since the sudden destruction of one bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, thereby likely destroying the entire local population.
The Shishmi are protected and illegally killed, tortured, tortured, or devastated or destroyed their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scottish Association for the Protection of the Squirrel, urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our ants, and for many of our species, we simply do not know how their population progresss.”
Ronaldo rejects the claim of rape while the lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German newspaper
Cristian Ronaldo is accused of violence against him described as "false news", saying that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will charge the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape by the Americans, named Kathryn Mayor, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid $375,000 for the incident, reported it on Friday, Der Spiegel.
In a video of his 142 million followers on Instagram, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the allegations as “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-year winner of the Golden Balls in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to speak my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the legometat with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called "an unacceptable report on the private issue," says Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that you would seek a bribe for “a moral damage in the tax that corresponds to the weight of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights damages in the past few years.”
It is reported how the above incident occurred in June 2009 at the apartment in the hotel and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga, as reported, returned to the legometasze room, where he reportedly raped her, mentioned in the documents that were filed in the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Major says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the above incident and told her that "99 percent" was a "good guy" who ignored that "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was reasonable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was photographed by injuries in the hospital, but that later she agreed to an external deal because she was "dangerous" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-olds say she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the way to Real Madrid from Manchester, the United States, during the above-mentioned attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian winter of Juve within a 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will "always throw" what the car manufacturers lost
The UK will "always cry" if after Brexit loses the status of the world's leader in the production of cars, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added how "an alarming" was what Toyota UK told BBC that, in case Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting on borders in the case of Brexit without agreement could cause loss of jobs.
In the past year, the borough of Burnaston was produced almost 150 000 cars, 90 % of which has been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March without agreement, it will experience production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin Director General in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement because of possible consequences for cross-border trade functioning, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he's gonna close his Miniature factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer is the risk of the supply chain in the case of Brexit without a successful contract.
Toyotin production line works according to the principle of "time-to-time adjustment", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for vehicles operating under orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could come to an end at the border for which the industry says it could lead to loss and loss of shares.
Toyota in his factory in Derbyshire could not hold more materials than those needed for one day, they said from that company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers plan, which offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU, is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to agree. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only maintaining the present success but also using this opportunity," said BBC Council's programme 4.
"The evidence not only toyote, but also other producers show that we must be absolutely able to continue this very successful range of supply chains."
In Toyoti they could not say how long production could have been stopped, but they warned that long-term attention would be paid, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who works in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a union member of the United States, said that his members are more concerned: “In my experience, after you're gone, you never come back. ”
The government spokesman says: "We have set out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be re-examined, says White House.
An important meeting of Donald Trumpa with a replacement of state attorney Rod Rosenstein could "depend for another week" to continue the struggle against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Bretta Kavanaugh, the White House announced.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Advocate Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the relationship between the Trump's co-operation with Russia and the possible arrest of justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump will release the replacement of a state lawyer and threaten Mueller's independence, which has been spreading the strikes in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the wearing of the wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of withdrawing the president on Monday 25th.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of the announcement that he would just take his leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said "I wouldn't like" to leave Rosenstein, but the meeting was arranged to avoid a violation with the hearing of the Senate Legal Committee in which they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh, which further resulted in a lot of Senate vote.
The crowd's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not fixed, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other things that are happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to report everything."
Some journalists would argue that: Sanders didn't hold a press conference in White House since December 10.
Leader Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of a press conference was not due to the "theatrical behaviour" of television reporters, although she said, "I won't stand up to the facts to argue."
Then she announced that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organizes more meetings on answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We analyzed the numbers."
The short term will continue to occur, Sanders said, but "if journalists have an opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that is definitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to make this possible often, and you can see it in the last few weeks, and that is just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace the press with the short term."
The drum regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
The single press conference is rare.
This week, the president in New York may have shown why, free and sometimes strangely before the journalists gathered.
The Ministry of Health writes to EU workers at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has directed a letter to the EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to lower the costs of raising the requirements for the welfare status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “Over the years negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, moving towards the expected decisions of this summer.
However, the United Kingdom government also strengthens preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult period for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU, and throughout the world, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjugated emergency surgery after head injury
The online player of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in a Saturday break from the Vanderbilt Commoders club with the result of 31 1⁄2 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Major coach Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury happened just before half an hour ago.
"He came to the game line and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie a kiss on the edge of the ground before they put it on their noses and sent it on further search.
The president of the University of Tennessee State said Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery in Vanderbilt's hospital.
Harris added that there's no "details about the type/performance of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when it came to the injury.
Abercrombie, a third-year-old student from a two-year-old game race, plays the first season for Tennessee State after a walk from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five fights before leaving the game, which he achieved total 18 in the season.
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
According to the new conservation plans, foreign buyers will pay more interest on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will be used to help the homeless
This step will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in taxes will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The solution is expected to collect up to 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be paid higher fees for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be understood as an attempt to neutralize Jeremiah Corbin's success in attracting young voters' promises to ensure more stable solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The increase in taxes will be paid by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will contribute to the Government's efforts to combat unemployment.
An additional allowance which is included in the current fee, including an increase which was introduced two years ago in other households and the real estate acquired in the production industry Õ may be up to three per cent.
The race is expected to collect 120 million pounds a year at this stage.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built estates in London are purchased by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for purchasers who buy first estate to join the company of those who own their own home.
Many rich areas in the country ←, especially in the capital, have become “the cities of spirits” because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction of charges to help a larger number of young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by taking or not using the country, and invited Mrs. May to withdraw from the quota on a price-free estate in order to correct "happiness due to the situation" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced the proposal of a series of attractive state reforms, including the control of the housing and the end of no action.
He also wants to give more authority to build new houses.
“ Last year, ” said Mrs. May, “I said that I would entrust my mandate to the restoration of Britain’s dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means correcting our deterioration of the stem market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life.
However, it cannot be true that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with an estate abroad, can easily buy houses as well as valuable British.
The dream of having a home has become too far from the great number of people, and the shame of being homeless is still real."
Jack Ross: "My final ambition is to manage Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "long-term ambition" one day becomes the manager of Scotland.
Scott (42) enjoys the challenge of raising a Northeast club, currently occupying a third place in the First League, with three points less than water.
This summer he moved to St. Mirren's stadium light after the last season again led by St. Mirren to a Scottish football club.
"I wanted to move on to my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross said to BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always pushed me back.
But this opportunity could only be realized if I had been successful in managing the club."
The Russian presidents at the office of the manager of Sunderland include Dicka Advocata, Davida Moyes, Sama Allardicea, Martina O'Neilla, Roya Keanea, Gusa Poyeta and Paula Di Cania.
Former chief Alla Athletic says he didn't feel afraid because he inherited so famous names in such a big club, after he had previously rejected calls at Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success of me at this moment will be measured by whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club is undoubtedly falling into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again."
Ross is only doing his managerial career for three years, after a period of time during which he was the assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the descent to the winner of the title of the first next season.
And Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepol, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably the right thing to break," Alloe recalled.
"I really believed that management was what suits me more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I made a good effort, made a solid recovery, and enjoyed a pretty successful moment.
But the game can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in the sense of stress and pressure, but management seems to be the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I feel better in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."
You can listen to all the interviews at the Sports Council on Sunday, December 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for the point is at 17:30 a.m. on Saturday, how the survey shows
The summer heat wave increased the arrivals of British pumps who suffered from financial problems, but increased pressure on the side of the restaurant.
The data show that pubs and barons have achieved an increase in income in Serbia by 2.7%, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the business advice of the Office of the Chief Book Controller, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the beautiful time and participation of England at the world’s long - lasting priority meant that the Serbs would be similar to the previous month of July, when the arrivals of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the fact that the restaurants were now even more vulnerable.
The drop of 1.8 per cent in the income of the restaurant in June just increased in August.
Pubs and barons where the main drinking services have achieved much more profits under the same conditions in relation to losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where the main food is served also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In managed beer shops and bars, the sale of alcohol increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, and the sale of food by three per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for vacation and hospitality, said: "These results continue to be a trend we see from the end of the storm.
Time and impact of major social or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to selling on the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although the fall of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful at annual level because of constant pressure.
Long summer couldn't come in the worse time for local leaders serving food, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in the colony would provide the transition as long as necessary."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7% in Serbia, reflecting the slowdown of the increase in the labour market.
The Coffer Peach Tracker system for the British pub sector, bar and restaurant collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and sets up an industrial reference value.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks that they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students showed an increase in the number of “false Instas” page
The news reinforced the fear of the advertising of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students reported having a "main" account showing parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “false Instas” accounts of references to the web site to share photos.
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they use a clear "main" account to show their parents and at the same time have private accounts.
One mother who found on her 13-year-old daughter's online website found a teenager who was moved by the other words, "Sit me."
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of Independent Schools (HMC) showed that 40% of students between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, half of which admitted to own private accounts.
HMC's head, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's interesting that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish athletic team
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Committee of Athletics as an imperfect director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle was the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who run sports to take advantage of its wide experience gained at international level over the past decade.
"Elidy enjoys great respect in Scotland, the British and the world's athletic community and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from being a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and I hope I can really bring sports to Scotland."
The American, who won the race at 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 game in Atlanta, from his total four Olympic gold, and now he's running a BBC expert, he couldn't walk any more after a passing ice attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only be time to show me if I wanted to get better.
It was hard, but he fully recovered, he learned to walk again, and today he is practicing agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Shared views on the Internet on advertising for a publisher comparing mothers with cows
A company for the production of a publisher by its advertising that the mother who gives birth to her children compares to the cows that the husband has raised a shared opinion on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of a product for which it is claimed that "the first silent nose of publishers in the world", Elvie’s consumer technology company has published an inspired ironic music video to show the freedom that the new publisher gives to mothers.
The four mothers dance in their standing with their ears full of tears and their voices with their voice saying, "Yes, I'm married, but you don't see any rap" and "If you haven't noticed, this isn't a vime, it's my breasts."
Then he said to them, "Go out, blow, feed the baby, blow, blow, blow, marry your ladies."
However, the ads published on the company's Facebook page raised controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video record has received mixed viewer reactions, and many say it exposes the "worse" of milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to hire and work to produce milk, except that children steal a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie is discrepancies in the dormitory (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “It is understandable that mother and child are traumatized.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a publisher for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A completely unbounded advertising."
The other defended the advertising, when one woman admitted that the song was “a funny one. ”
"I think this is a genius idea.
If I had another drink, I'd buy one.
The milking has made me feel exactly like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I got it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is fun advertising directed at mothers who issue milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘ bread ’.
This is not advertising that commends or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with discreet publishers located in the chest.
The concept of campaigns is based on the recognition that many women who issue milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's publisher, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and is discrepancies in the breast-feeding nursery, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even get out during delivery.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive director of Mother’s agency, commented: “Elvie’s publisher is so revolutionary that he deserves courage and provocative launch.
The real parallel between women and cows is that we wanted to focus on the issue and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and reasonable way to demonstrate an incredible sense of freedom that the new publisher will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's publisher got to the headlines.
During London's weekly fashion, the mother of two children appeared on a fashion paper for designer Martu Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children migrant secretly transferred to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants increased although the number of monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the heavy rhetoric and policies imposed by the Tromp's administration made children vulnerable to sponsoring.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also themselves immigrants without documents and were afraid to risk their own ability to stay in the country by taking over and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to be given fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, High Commissioner for Immigration and Customs, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested ten people who had reported to sponsor a minor without a trace.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons were not registered in criminal records.
"At least 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households in the country are illegal, and most of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the employers' statements, with the aim of speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of processing, not after 60 days, which was previously standard.
Many will appear by means of a video conference call, not personally, in order to remove their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to workers' statements in the shelter and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, which is more likely to be severe or depressed, which can lead to violent disappearances or refugee attempts.
Prisoners said these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, because of his size, it is very likely that signs of child suffering will be warned.
They added that moving children to the camp without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to have a good time with friends can lead to the trauma that many children have already experienced.
Syria orders America, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Moulalem, who is also a prime minister's replacement, said that the forces were on the Syrian soil illegally, in the face of the fight against terrorism, and that it would be “constant with them and act.”
"They must withdraw immediately and inevitably," said the congregation.
Moulalem insisted that "war against terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died in 2011, while millions were left without their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "be a fight in this world until all Syrian territories are cleansed" by terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 soldiers in Syria, who are mainly practicing and advise also Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war of the devastated country.
As for refugees, Moulal said that the conditions for their return were fulfilled and he covered "some Western lands" for "screaming the Iraqi terrors" that urged refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ease these returns," he said.
"They policy what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not be helpful to rehabilitate Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and opposition to the end of the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of the Tampon Zone in the last large rebel shelter of Idliba created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the massive attacks of Syrian forces with Russia's support on the territory where three million people live.
Moulalem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "open arms" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed to the Jihadists, including the Nusra front battles associated with Al-Qaid, "which will be used".
Ambassador of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, will soon be convened in order to establish a subsequent constitution for Syria and open the way for the elections.
Moulalem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the demand for trust should be limited to "in the revision of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump's gonna win another mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the re-election of 2020 unless many liberal observers are likely to hope, opposition and scandal to end his presidency early.
What would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the viewer dying right now.
Since 2014, the impact period has doubled to 1,05 million to CNN and almost to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in an attack term, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcasts overloaded with almost 3.5 million viewers to the evenings of the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer producer of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scowell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
It is remembered for driving in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He answered, "Because he laughs at me," said Mrs. Scowell.
There's a fun value in the casino.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on the removal of the prosthetics from Roe v Wade process, whether immigrant families can reunite the global economy and health.
Exclude is a luxury that can only allow the most privileged viewers.
However, you are exaggerating the degree of an informed citizen when you realize that you have been looking at a group of experts for six hours to discuss how Bob Woodward used the sources of "long background" for his book "Fear", about which Paul Manafort of a new skin worth $15,000 ("the object filled with falsehood", writes Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, Mr. Trupa's anatoms that he gives Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that you eat something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creation of the "Zalagaonica" show on the rotating playing station and every day's Trumpovo show (bouts with N.F.L., thank Kim Jong-una).

When I arrived this week to Mr. Fleissa, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kuaija was sunned at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watched MSNBC and simultaneously filmed CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was coming to an end.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy broadcasts in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was some joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money went out of sight in the most uncertain middle-aged race for the convention
It is not surprising that the 17th round of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the refurbishment of the congressional districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently restructured area of the Pittsburgh building points to the democracy of Conora Lamba Õ, which has won a place in the second district in the special elections.
Lamb competes against another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in conflict with the new 17th round.
The cards were re-examined after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts had been illegally hidden for the benefit of the Republicans.
The impact of the new 17th round launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main party funders, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after his victory in the widely followed special March elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This position has been held by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the round with the preference of 20 points.
Political analysts have given an unknown preference to democracies.
The US considers whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China and then withdraw
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners had released the Trump's management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to call the US Diplomatic Mission Chiefs of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "new decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said the speaker Heather Nauert.
However, the sentences were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million US dollars in 2017 for, among others, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial aid and the target of visa restrictions, would be diseases for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to continue in a similar collection last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, until mid-May, the high officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that, in fact, they had ceased any consideration of the El Salvador penalty.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-November, as a sign of the importance of the administration of the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sentences from Washington.
Speaker White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the terms of anonymity.
Their reports confirmed an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next preparation could be the report by special researcher Robert Mueller on the possible discipline of Trump's court, which now has very significant public evidence available.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also focused his research on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just when he is ready to go again before the election, and perhaps in the end and his marriage is right.
There are a lot of these "if" and I do not want to suggest that Mr Truma's inevitable fall - even those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German journalists were ready to execute a state attack on Hitler, only that the West opposed and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We didn't succeed and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of their succession.
History revolves around such inflation points, and the impossible margin of democracy is speeding up or late.
The Americans are now facing a few of these influences.
What will we do if Mr. Trump leaves the replacement of the state attorney, Roda Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these news reports reported that last year, he has subsequently submitted a video of the president and hoped for his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says Tim's report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if a recent FBI investigation about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonesty?"
And above all, do we want to vote in the mid-term elections for Congress that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once settled in my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to burn the candles to the couch on that table with a cup of caustic cross.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Beča
The Rangers are on Thursday at the home of Rapid from Becha, knowing that they will win against the Austrians, after an impressive campaign in Spain against Villarrell this month, put in voice position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
The damage of the knee prevented the association Graham Dorrass from appearing for the first time in the 2nd floor season with Villarreol, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a dropboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal was a good opponent," said a 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled out a point.
We may eventually have stolen the game, but, generally viewed, the unsolved result is probably postulated.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second half.
There's another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's gonna be a hard game because they've had good results in the last game, but with the support of the winner, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, among all the things that happened to my injuries and changes in the club alone, but now the government has a good feeling.
Boys are good and boys really enjoy; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the fear of peace
Despite the fact that the investigators had a clear preoccupation with what they wanted, few people talked to their family members about it.
About half of the researchers at the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of National Security.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your wife and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t express your wishes first.
Work with your counselor and your family to talk about where and how to take care of them, as your choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your selection of long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with money that will help you to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth while you have money.
Collect your legal documents: prevent legal battles in progress.
Aggregate healthcare professionals in order to determine a reliable person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals are satisfied with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider giving plenty to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions in your name and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not able.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires an emergency medical intervention and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about finances, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in your hands."
A man shot several times from an airgun in Ilfracombe

Poets and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials arrived, and an increase in the number of deaths is expected.
Since communications have been interrupted, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from Dondre's territory, the northern area of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 degrees power stream.
After the disaster in Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donghi, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donghea is a coastal area that extends over 300 km of coast to the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
In addition, the administrative region has been estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, particularly the coastal region of Donghe.
The mines are also important in the landscape, but they are mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palo and Dondrea have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donghi.
Tsunami also struck West Donghan 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and regularly talks are discussed.
Here are some of the main attacks and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on Northern Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong attacks struck the western coast of Sumatra by the end of the summer and the beginning of the spring.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6,8 degrees hit south of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 degree earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 feet [10 m] that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: Pidie Jaya hit the Acehu region, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the 2004 death strike and tsunami.
This time it didn't get to the tsunami, but more than 100 people died after the building fell.
2018.: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern side of the island.
Potres destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sare Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Aljas and candidate for Vice-President Sare Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of family violence, the refusal of family violence and the refusal of arrest, is reported in a report published on Saturday by the state police officer Aljaske.
According to the police report, when the informant tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and is held on an insurance bond of $500, the KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where the issue of the explanation of the crime was explained “unfortunately, of course,” a network reported.
The palace is set up for three Class A infringements, which means he could be in jail for a year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of violating Class B, which is sentenced to one day in prison and money in the amount of $2000.
It's not the first time the charges against Palina have been filed.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the vet court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, the arrest of family violence and the possession of weapons in an alcoholicized state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
Saru Palin criticized the veterinary group in 2016 after linking his son's violent behavior with the PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and poets in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are halted, and in the next days the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Potres hit the immediate vicinity of Central Sulawesi, northeastern of the capital of Indonesia Jakarte.
On social networks, videotapes are surrounded by video clips showing the moment of attack.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pallu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for suspects for a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Sayfulla Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died in a rare sentence that has not been committed in a state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to hire a home Depot store to carry out an attack on a bicycle train along the West Side road in Donja Manhattan, where the passengers and bicycles found on his way to November
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "naturally" killed eight victims and "naturally" brought a serious physical injury, according to a report on the intention of seeking a death penalty, which was put in the south of New York.
Both of these points lead to the death penalty, in accordance with a judicial document.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury of Saipova attacked a 22-point prosecutor, who included eight charges of murder and ransom, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "discreet planning and thinking," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov treated him as a "good, cruel and honest man".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchia, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pannucca," says the report.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the southern part of New York last time the case of death penalty was tried.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in June 2009.
The death penalty was finalized in a federal case in New York, 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were murdered after they were sentenced to a conviction for spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on 19 July 1953 at an electric chair.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of complaints in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police called him.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video recording on his phone, he was inspired to execute the attack, mentioned in the charge.
He also asked for ISIS to report the arrest in his hospital room, and the police called.
He made it clear that he was not guilty of 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "very disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty, not to accept the confession of life in prison without the possibility of release, will only extend the course of these events to all involved," Patton said.
The defense team previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL Farage should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the national army" today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former Head of the Independent Party of the United Kingdom said that politicians had to "feel pressure" the Eurosceptics because one of Parliament's Members Therese May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone announced a return to Birmingham to the United Kingdom so far "went out" that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced in resolving their deeply divided order highlights the distant remnant that joins a special campaign against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise plan "Chequers" in the middle of the Brexit attack, accession to the rest of the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue with attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction Õ and force Eurosceptics and labs to choose between its package and ‘caosa’.
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihul that he wants to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have a title and be responsible for talks with Brussels.
"If he were the head, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must shoot Chequers."
Summing up his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in the world's wars to be defeated.
We want to bring our own laws into our country."
Mr. Bonne rejected the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that they want to stay completely wrong is wrong."
Conservatives and representatives of Brexit Andrea Jenkins were also on the scene, talking to journalists: “I just say: ‘ Premier, listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our side and among our activists who are actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a surprising message, Mrs. May added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises. ”
Farage told the audience that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are ready to ignore the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us and our political classes," he said.
"They're trying to publish Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that's not going to happen to you."
In a letter to the excited audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit’s publishing, to feel pressure.
We mobilize this country's national army that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not be calm until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the remains were marched through Birmingham before they held a two-way assembly in the city center.
The majority of activists failed the transparency of "Torieves against Brexit" after the launch of the group this weekend.
Laburist Lord Adonis begged the conservatives for the security problems they had endured with the application of the parties during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the "Canad plus" plan for an undisputed state on the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete phrase.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "really consider" a candidate for the president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "really consider candidates for the president" after the student's election.
Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts spoke about its future on Saturday in direct association with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trumpa, is a candidate for re-election in studies against the Republican Geoffrey Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trumpo campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's been a while in the middle of speculation to be able to resist the 2020 trumpet.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took over his duties.
The judge asked her if she was planning to apply for the president.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, and that means a woman on her head."
arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rougeu, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested the suspects in a murder shooting at the State University in Louisiana (LSU) Wayde Sims, which took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police published information on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at a press conference.
On Friday, they published a murder video, looking for help in identifying a man from the picture.
Sims (20) was killed early on Friday near the University of Southern.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result of it," said police chief Murphy J. Paul media on Saturday, 247sports.
Wayde was involved in protecting his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was investigated and admitted that he was in the crime scene and owned a weapon and that he killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to prison in the Japanese police East Baton Rouge.
Sims, a third-year-old student up to 198 cm who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 years of the season and averaged 17.4 minutes and achieved 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps after the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of the World Cup after his leader guarantees victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the team leader will "play a great role in the race".
With the initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettle to attack his team.
The winner first went to the box and left Hamilton to get in traffic at first, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of the driver on the wheel, which caused Ferrari to find it difficult to leave the free interior in danger of staying after a two-way move in defense of the third crime.
Max Verstappen left the last row and was seven to the end of the first circle on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race as he leaned on his rubber to reach the quick end and crossed the Kimi Raikconen for the fourth place.
He finally arrived in box on the 44th round, but he couldn't speed up his pace in the other eight rounds while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and was the real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done a really great job to achieve the formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday because she insisted that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Turning to a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly forget the testimony of the Forum before the Senate's Legal Committee, but commented that what happened in Senate showed that people were “bad and dishonest and unfair.”
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger when you see people who are angry and angry, angry, and dishonest, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and publishing information in public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you left any information?
Remember her answer... did you leave the document in public - 'aaaa, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we just... no, we didn't," added the sponsoring senator.
Senator Feinstein in Serbia sent a letter with details of the instructions of the Forum against Kavanaugh, and went through earlier in June - but Feinstein claimed that the information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't leave her story to the public," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret, which she asked for."
However, her complaint did not reach the president’s approval, who, at the meeting on Saturday evening, commented: “Let me tell you something - it was a very bad speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a burning body talk in my life."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that democracy be used for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return the government at every price.
You see the crime, the madness, the indifference of those who are going to hurt, who have to go through to power and control," said the president, the media transfer.

In the early minutes, Giants came to the advantage of the two top hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney brought home to equality, and then Dwyer came back to Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard compared to Dundee before the two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed victory.
It was the third time in the season in the Elite League for the boy Adam Keefe, who came from the background and won Dundee's score at 2 a.m. in Belfast on Friday night.

Air traffic controllers die to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft escape traffic
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while ensuring safe air traffic with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many of them died as a result of a massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong attacks continue to be discussed in the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the control tower of Mutira Sis Al Jufri, who was deeply angry.
He stayed to secure the safe landing of the Batik Air aircraft at the 6321 flight, which was then on the bridge.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he'd run.
He moved to the hospital later.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalinantan to move him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are ashamed of it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster relief agency says there is limited access to the cities of Donghi, Sigija and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number of dead continues to increase, since many bodies are still under disturbances, and so many have not been able to come to it," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the agency.
The waves that reached the height, and up to three feet [6 m], broke down the Pala, which will hold a mass drop in the week.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “It takes a lot of emergency to help every minute of the body's import.
The government is desecrating clean water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross swears to help the survivors, but we do not know what will be found there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo agreed on Sunday in Palu and said: “Please all of you work day and night to complete all the evacuation duties.
Are you ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia was hit this year by earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is running like a missing man after the plane crash in the valley
The aircraft company owned by the owner of the aircraft that collapsed into a peaceful garage in Micronesia now claims that one man is running like a missing person, after it has been said that all 47 passengers and members of the crew are safely evacuated from the aircraft that has been destroyed.
In his statement, Air Niugini said I can't get in the track from Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find the person concerned.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while he was trying to land in the airport of Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were kept in the hospital on Saturday, and that everyone was in a stable state.
What caused the fall and the exact outcome of the event remain unknown.
Aircraft and American mariners said the aircraft landed in a cage near the bridge.
Some fathers thought that the plane had dropped the gun.
Bill Jaynes, a traveler from America, said the plane was very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to pass through the water that led them to their way to the exit in case of the danger of the plane that hit him.
He said that the studs were panicked and screamed, and that he was suffering less damage to his head.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors working near the port to repair the port also helped save the use of the boat to launch people's transport to the shore before the plane dropped about 30 meters of water.
Air safety data indicate that in the accident of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, 111 people were killed, but none of them were included in Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a time review of the night in which a woman burned alive
The prosecution concluded on Saturday a case in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of reporting data analysis.
The report described how he used the data from the cell phone to put the case on the move of 29-year-old witness Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers at night when he was murdered, which was contrary to his previous claims, carried The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was on the same spot as Chambersin at the time he was with his own friend Michael Sanford, the police went to examine Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors arrested him, did Tellis tell the truth when he said that the night was in the Sanford truck, Sanford said he was "recorded because his truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data showed that they only met once a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, a certain time after Chambersine's death, deleted her messages, calls and contact information from the phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the enlightened hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude towards the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The singing group "The High Breed" from Bristol claims that the hip-hop music has distanced from its beginnings from political messages and feedback on social issues.
They want to return to their roots and hip-hop to make it popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commona are born again in Great Britain through artists like Akal and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
Dadil from New York complains a couple of dropouts after the "racist" message
The New York Times report a couple of cases of discrimination after receiving a misdirected message from a mother called "one more black".
Some claim to be racist, comparing the charge with the "resurrection".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed discontent when, after her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"No more CNNKINIA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a letter to his wife.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "failure" situation, and left Mrs. Maurice, because she claims that theirs was an already ex-American nanny, who was doing his job badly, and that instead of expecting the Philippines, she transferred New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice complains a couple of fines to cancel and seeks compensation of $350 per day for a period of six months for which she has been initially engaged, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple went back to the claim that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to do the end of Mauritian employment, because of the fear that she would not be able to believe later because of her injuries.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent in a message.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"Would you believe your children to whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said that his wife received only two months of birth leave after the birth of the child and that she was in “a very difficult situation. ”
"You'll accuse someone who's in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not be confronted with the witness who speaks, found in a new letter.
A Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says: “It’s hard to put in someone’s skin for the first time to read the book.
It's very funny what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says that her father, who worked as a BBC photographer before the little busted bear inspired him to write a book to the boy, was optimistic when his work would be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the release of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, described as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a man and he wasn't a praiser," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything happened to be like someone who reaches his own child: you're proud of him even though none of it really is your job.
I think Paddington's success has been observed this way.
Although it was about his work and his skill, the benefits always described the exclusive Paddington."
My daughter died, and we had to leave by phone.
After the discharge, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors sincerely tried to save her life.
"On a regular call to say it's really bad and to believe it won't come out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to forgive her.
What I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate gradually lost effect and left her body system.
She died a little before she was picked up, and then everything went off.
I just had to sit down and wait to know what's going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in my hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had been in grief for the loss of her daughter, fell into the plane with the rest of the passengers - who were not aware of the experience she had passed.
"No one knew," she said.
"I let my head down, and my tears all the time, they fell down on my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong sense of judgment against Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women's messages in mourning at the bridge with a view to preventing suicide
Two women who were left without loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a large bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Miss Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and in 18 years he committed suicide.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with an early eight-year-old who was waiting for a career.
"All of them remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
Before his death, however, he left his job because he was in “the real darkness. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after you took this life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came to the idea with the cards "how people would know there is someone you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in the silence . . You have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his partner who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was on his own day when the children opened gifts, he didn't look at them in his eyes, nor did he want anything else."
She said that his death was a great tragedy, but that they had to overcome it: “It all leaves a big hole in the family.
Let's go.
But we will continue to fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh is about the end of the FBI's investigation
"I thought we might be able to destroy a little unity if we were really able to get something like what he asked for in a time-limited investigation," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would be "resisting" in the middle of the stolen foreign blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican colleagues want the FBI investigation?
Their difficulty is triggered by the choice of the moment.
The medium-term elections come in only five weeks, 6th of November, if, what is expected, the Republicans are not well, then they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush continued to call the senator, holding them back to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
He will vote in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to pass a decisive vote and confirm his position at the Supreme Court.
North Korea's escape number under Kim's leadership
The number of escapes from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Calling on data from the United Kingdom's Ministry of the South Union, Park Byeong-seug said there was 1127 escapes last year in line with 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors are better control over border crossings between North Korea and China and more taxes paid by thieves to people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of the fleeing north finally received South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to pass than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China's escape considers illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
The relations between the North and the South which have been still technical in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang in talks focused on the premier negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trumpa and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work for the liberation of Korean semi-weapons from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed the American sanctions for not making any progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not take into account that under such circumstances we are first disappointed," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "historic", says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
The opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court's trial candidate Bretta Kavanaugh "hissterical" and said that because of his temperature he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't but don't think that a woman would, if she had ever acted like that, call it 'historic'," Pelosi described his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally deplored the claim that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, temporarily almost crying and smiling as he discussed his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the democratics in the committee, calling charges against him "grassy and coordinated siege" that organized anger that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed that he had a prejudice against democracy.
"I think he is disqualified by such statements and the way Mrs Clinton and Democrats attack him," she said.
The question is whether they will try to call Kavanaugh if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get most of the Western House, Pelosi is exhausted.
"I'll tell you the next time he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not possible not only to be in the Supreme Court but not in the court at which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Appeals Court in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Act on Accessory Care or the Law on the Debt of the Roe Procedure against Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings for confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would reconsider any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a hysterical, forced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'is not wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to wear it.
Just criticism, anger that has been collected for months and years can't be dismissed without payment.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steine 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
She continues: “It has been a great help to me to a woman who was once a executive director and who said how she cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that, when she was angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to next person says: ‘ You may think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
I'm mad."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Suspension is permitted as an outlet for anger, partly because they are mistakenly understood.
One of my most clear memories of one of the first jobs, in the office where the men were dominant, is how I, once when I cried because of the inexhaustible heat, an elderly woman  preached to a cold manager who was always a little afraid of getting back to the station.
"Don't ever let him see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they're going to be happy because they think they hit you."

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extraterrestrial affair on the Monkey Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of candidateing for the president.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she told me in a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they must not have needed another one.
Someone called them "Snöguljic and seven bats."
Since the campaign was already under way, she was left with a collection of funds, and she said she wouldn't get into the race if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her gifts, which gave the men $1,000, were just $250.
"Do they think I have a break?" she asked.
While she said she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions about the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it difficult to collect money and target her rather than the delegates, and anger over sexism to make her feel worse.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's media reaction to her.
"You'd think Klenex is my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what would put on my grave note.
"It's stuck."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of a trade war between the United States and China has been voted out loud and, while the fight is far from over, the gap between the countries can be from the use of Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning earlier this year, undermining key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scalation in this week appeared with new carinas that have influenced products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion dollars), which actually discourages half of all slaves coming to the United States of China.
Peking has come back every time in a way, and recently it has been introduced to a quarter of five to ten percent to 60 billion American slaves.
China promised to hit the US to respond to the strike, and the second largest global economy would certainly not be delivered soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could result in a release of requests, but the public humiliation of the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Peking plays his cards well, US military pressure can provide long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the move of economic flows in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a strategic thinker who focused on Asia in the new US Security Centre.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of a refugee, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the restoration of a country that has destroyed a war that lasts for more than seven years.
Turning to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said how conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the single economic measures that were directed to their daily life and existence are met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam said that the Syrian regime would be better able to help rehabilitate the affected country.
However, he pointed out that he would not accept any conditional aid or aid from the nations that were sponsoring the rebellion.

The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US final result of 16.5 χ 10.5 on Le Golf National near Paris, France.
So far, they have lost six times on the European ground and have not won Ryder's purchase in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again while the Danish captain Thomas Bjorna team reached 14.5 points that were needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who suffered during almost the entire tournament, sent a ball in the water at the first strike, leaving the sword Francescu Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds and has become one of four players who have ever achieved up to 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament began this format.
American Jordan Spietha fired Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European boys, with 5&4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 from England Iana Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder buy.
The Veteran eight Ryder buys, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the highest win in the tournament with the winning 25.5 points in the career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop tears.
It was a hard year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the purchase again.
I'm glad I could help," said Garcia, full of emotions after the European victory.
He brings the ball to his cousin John Ramu, who has won a legendary American golfer on Sunday, Tiger Woods, resulting in 2&1.
"I feel incredible pride because of the victory over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four swords in France, and now he has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder tap.
The unusual statistics of one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, are right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf all over the tournament.
After the disappointment of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: “I'm proud of these boys, they fought. ”
At some point, we have opposed Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm breaking the thomas cap.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm gonna work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, so we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take the cap off people.
We're overplayed."
