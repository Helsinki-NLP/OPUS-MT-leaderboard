If we do more, it'll go better.
It looks like it's worth it.
The bus driver didn't see the driver.
Tom didn't want to go there after dark.
I can't blame you.
Tom was betrayed for murder.
He wants to see his grandfather.
I'm worried about the future.
Come on, don't blow your face!
I don't want to stop.
Mari, come on quickly!
She paid you another whiskey.
Tom, I mean a moment from the optimistic.
I want to learn German, but I don't have time.
Let's go!
Shall I close?
I gave Tomina my old hat.
I forgot about Tom.
Don't give me my number, Tomina.
Why do you need a new one?
The man's drinking coffee in the coffee shop.
The thought and practice are not necessarily shared.
Thank you for everything you've done.
Oh, please, don't say that.
We're eating with our mouth.
That depends.
I'm not the one you should keep.
I'm interested in the regions.
It's not complicated.
I don't want to hear your murder anymore.
Are you really happy?
He's always afraid.
Who the fuck is Tom?
Don't be like a baby.
Tom joined the witness.
They're salesmen.
I didn't answer your letter because I was too busy.
I was hoping this would happen in secret.
Steve didn't come home.
Mary decided she'd eat more sugar.
You're keeping the key to success.
Don't look at this.
That was really interesting.
Now the dance.
What kind of painkiller can I give my dog?
The cold water was cut off from the roof.
Let me think a little more about this.
I'm curious what happened to Paula.
Alan loves his pornography.
I don't know where Tommy used to get the food.
It's a stupid rule.
Citrus is waiting for me.
What did you say?
Don't get it!
He always wanted to call you attention.
Three minutes ago, I explained to the station that Tommy was on his way.
The window is open.
Do you still hate it?
Can I join you?
He didn't finally come.
He lives in a big house.
If you had stayed with us, you wouldn't have been in trouble.
I brought you some food.
Tom's usually wrong.
The explosive is in love language.
Be more patient.
I don't want to wait.
I can show you how to do it if you want.
In East Timor, the prosthetic prosthesis as never before.
Most of the cream contains fluoride.
Go on!
I was really funny tonight.
Why would you want to be a sister?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I did it myself.
Taro, get ready for dinner.
There's only five things on the list.
The box was so hard that Tom had to help Mari get her home.
Do you have enough energy?
Get yourself your degree degree degree.
Please, call the cops.
But great dad, Tommy's not gay, just trendy!
It's very hard for the liver.
I have to go.
Are you hot?
He found another lost rocker and took it to him.
Tom has a specific personality.
He was so eager to open the box.
You're very good.
I thought you trusted me.
Tom didn't look like a marine disease.
I fell asleep and scared.
I can't see anything.
What did you get?
No one knows the truth.
I love the dog.
You've already taken the ice cream?
Get the fuck out of here!
Don't fuck with me.
Better if you don't talk.
Tom used to be nice.
I'm pretty scared.
There's Tom and Mari's wedding anniversary today.
Tom falsely accused Mary.
They're starting to name themselves.
You're still with me.
Tom's not home.
What's wrong with you guys?
You want to dance with me?
It's been an exciting experience for you.
Tominas have a long hat.
We're just starting now.
We're going to buy.
Tom's gone.
They stayed there for a long time.
Children are willing to hear the same story again and again.
We're with you.
Tom found out he was wrong.
Open the bottom.
Have you been to Istanbul yet?
Tom apologized for not coming earlier.
Is the party clean?
He's drunk.
Tom's pregnant.
We know you're sick.
I don't belong to you.
I cut my hand with Tom, and I went.
Is that the deal?
Without you, I'm just a part of it.
Gordon's been up all week.
Tom was my son.
We only use 10% of our brain.
It's the last hour of your tour.
She doesn't want to travel.
Don't talk too much to the lovers.
You're never too old to learn.
I was so proud of myself that I put my bed in a week's sleep.
Tommy's back in the shooting.
You're as tall as the last time you were here.
The horses are asleep.
It's not a good time to talk about it.
What happened then?
The kid's making a mess.
That's good.
What did Tommy do in his bag?
Tom left the book.
I've never killed anyone. I've never killed anyone.
It's May's Friday.
That makes me sad.
The film's got hard criticisms.
After work, it's nice to cry.
Tom filled you with another cup of coffee.
Get him out of here!
That's incredible.
Are you still busy with him?
You look like you're out of your mind.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Of course you don't know anything about that.
Tom appreciates being free.
I'll come if the timing permits.
He's got two dogs.
It's a good thing to be innocent.
Allig knows Tommy.
It doesn't make sense to compare them.
It won't matter how important this meeting is.
We were both safe.
I don't have any money.
I think that would explain everything.
He's gone.
It's not the same thing to say and do.
Tell me.
This guy's Fisher Tommy.
That's temporary.
He was tennis yesterday.
Hey, how are you?
It's a beautiful dress.
What time of teaching do you like most?
I was the last person I saw him.
It's gonna take a little time to add to the visual examination.
I appreciate your friendship.
Did you get away with the first one?
I need to check it out.
I ate it.
Tommy's family needed money.
Fire's out.
Give me time to think about it.
Why did you buy this brand?
It's my farm, and it's not selling!
The name's a girl.
I love kids.
Her mother isn't as old as she looks.
Turn this thing over.
The boy got into the water.
I don't have a name.
Mom had red hair and a red blood cells.
Please, write my name up.
Tom's dead?
I was happy for an hour until I found out where to go.
He's been involved in the revolution.
In this case, the judge didn't go to sports.
That's a very bad idea.
Change is coming.
Who are you talking to?
You can name everything in the language that you're reporting.
Tommy said he had to go to Mari.
That's all I needed.
Would you do it again?
When I forgot my promise, it became very angry.
I don't understand.
Tom's full.
How long are you going to school?
Tom's with us.
I was hoping you'd heal.
I still can't tell you why.
It's a personal place.
It's not too much.
He called this morning.
No, no, that's for me.
I don't want to be selfish.
I'd like to think twice in your place if I chose this route.
I don't know what kind of child you are.
It's one of my shitholes.
Taxi went to my museum.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's your gift.
You're a philosopher, aren't you?
Give me your tongue.
I can't make it without you.
Tom's a big fan.
He's got a room at the door.
The three great monotheistic beliefs of Christianity, Islam and Judaism.
I couldn't go back.
I still don't know why you did it.
Would you like to be famous?
It's an exception.
You're not my boss.
I'm just a average guy who doesn't have a killer.
I didn't say anything.
Tom didn't know what Mary was talking about.
Tom doesn't know what happened because he wasn't there.
No one can help us.
He hasn't seen this world yet.
Tom can help me.
That's what happened on our wedding day, darling.
Halley's funeral will appear every 76 years.
We're in jail.
I raised the boy.
I love Arabic.
My office's always open.
Please, come here.
I see the sea and the river.
Your father saved his life for science.
She gave me another toll.
I always wanted to meet you.
Why is he home anyway?
He was contacted by the water because he didn't pay the bill.
Never stop talking to strangers.
Are you really sure?
Tom is now French.
I'm not home yet.
I'd give up my life, too.
It's been hard for the first time.
I was worried about what he said.
I don't know if it counts.
How did the traffic accident happen?
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
It's just him!
We're competitive.
Idiots, I appreciate the box.
I spent the whole day in front of my machine.
I should have come here first.
She didn't go to church yet.
Let me sleep another ten minutes.
My wife's a thief.
From this we learned that no one can trust anyone.
Who can blame you?
That's not gonna work out.
Look at that mountain.
Leave that poor boy alone.
You speak French very well, and I would like to speak this language as well as you.
The worst pain I've ever had.
The current education system does not cause, but replaces the students.
The king rules all the mountains.
Two minutes after the car, the gas went out.
The bus's already gone until my wife's done the rehearsal.
You should want my hair down now.
Do you have to work on Sundays?
A powerful man is not subject to corruption.
It's gonna be a good time.
Did you grow up in your school?
I know he's still there.
The taste is healthy.
There's been an alarm in the distance.
Of course I do.
You seem tired, but Tommy doesn't.
Please call me if he's coming closer.
Whoever it is, we can't do anything else than trust it.
Let's see what's the result.
I love this book for the best.
I didn't drink alcohol for six months.
I don't usually buy on the Internet.
I have no victory without a victim.
I didn't lie.
I'd rather live in a world of peace than in economic and economic misery.
Are you sick?
The penis got into the hole.
I heard everything.
When did you get to Jokoham?
Tom's a typical English.
It's me.
Can I call you some time?
I don't care how late you're gonna be, but you'll get out of here in the morning.
He's got two tits, one white and the other black.
It's a lot more complicated than I thought it was.
My apartment is more comfortable than yours.
Science is important in our lives.
We love each other, but we don't live any longer.
Tom wants it too.
This is my bedroom.
I was married at the time.
It's like your boss.
We're planning to move the mountain.
Same age.
It's a crime.
He did it like he didn't hear his boss.
You know, when you think about yourself, you know.
Let me look at these photos.
I'm probably able to do very little.
I don't need anything.
No one said that before.
Her dog's been taught some legal tricks.
It's ruined.
Some claim that the dragonfly improves our vision.
She asked him, and he said yes.
Most people like the meat.
Take another look at the city map.
Our ship won for two years.
When was the last time you saw Tommy calling?
Maryn was a good guy.
He also learned a new word.
That's something.
Do you know where they are?
The patient's constant care.
How, please?
Tom needs your help.
You're making preparations?
We're gonna get out of here.
That's how you want to stop this?
He likes to watch baseball games on the TV.
It's about our help.
He's going out of the house on Friday.
I have letters.
Stop or I'll shoot!
Tom's gonna miss me so much.
I want to see something else.
I was the greatest man in the world.
I didn't think I'd ever get to sleep on the floor.
Did you feel anything about me?
Tom's too much to go home.
Just do it, it's a good feeling.
You're a strong guy, aren't you?
He drove one in front of him in the morning.
I was scared last night.
My dad's just improving my broken bike.
Russia Europe or Asia?
You love coffee better.
I'll make sure Tom helps you.
Tommy was hiding behind a tree, but I saw it.
They're already missing.
I'd rather go.
A black BMW park in front of your house.
I'm going back to Boston.
I don't understand him again.
There's a new dictionary under the plan.
I see a rose.
Let me do something else.
Let's keep talking in English, please.
This is the least I can do.
You don't know his name?
What are the symptoms?
We had a lot of innovations.
Intelligence.
Did you know that?
My oldest son, too.
He was injured in the accident.
Everyone's tired.
I didn't mean to show you that.
What's the matter?
He's not married.
There's a higher temperature here than in Tokyo.
We need more than that.
I'm too old to go to Australia.
Fukok.
They made a mistake.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
What's in these guys?
You can't say anything else.
I don't want to believe that.
You didn't kill him.
One of my kids is sick.
Listen to me, please.
Tom's just waiting for his birthday party.
He's a very young man, much younger than Tom.
It's a condition, it's not true.
You know what I'm looking for.
You're not God.
Well, don't tell me, my undercrowd is older than you.
I've been a member of the parent working community since the Council.
Tom took his cat.
I'm still looking for work.
I can't believe you.
We can change our background for the good.
It's the blue pummel.
I don't want to live in Boston.
You're a dead man if you don't.
He's the only one who knows and can carry out the task.
You're still a sister, aren't you?
He couldn't come because of his illness.
He didn't promise to come back.
Tominas have a long way to go.
It was once, where it wasn't, once it was an old man.
I want to go to the country.
The police sent a non-inactive product to Dan.
She's too busy to help me.
He didn't talk to me at the party.
He stole an old lady.
He's still home.
The test was successful.
This tree is too young to produce fruit.
Tom has no enemies.
Maria's been a bit sloppy from the roof.
Tom's back.
Anything you can choose.
It's been a few minutes. It's ready for dinner.
According to the report, over the past 30 years, the world's seas have disappeared.
What a bad movie!
I'll wait in the shop until you're ready.
What kind of woman do you keep me?
He's particularly upset about this.
I don't think I understand.
The possibilities are coming, they're going.
I heard a kiss.
My boss is an asshole.
Don't try to tell me you don't like the shoes.
Don't you mind if I sit here?
Are you excited?
Try some.
He gave him all the details.
It was a really good meal.
Cars must leave at least one metre wide sand when traveling along the bikes.
Tom always tells Mari that he loves her.
Everyone's got it.
Sit down and tell me how you got out of this terrible mess.
Why did you come here?
I could have done it on my own, I think.
I'm surprised you didn't bring Tommy with you.
We were all very happy.
I don't like it, not even if he loves me.
Tom usually helps do my homework.
Tom's sick.
You should throw this out.
How many stops are there?
I'd like to tell you how I'm going to Boston.
I didn't mean it at all.
That would've been a good thing.
The import of rare species into this country is extremely difficult.
The Mormons are working together.
Aircraft are rising at half the speed of the lift.
I knew a lot about Tomir.
Tom told them not to do this.
What's your name?
He's been reading a lot.
Tom doesn't mean it.
My grandfather founded the company, and my parents continue to be successful.
No, no, no, no, no.
I hit the test.
That would be a wise thing.
Maybe someone can help you.
Would you like to answer some questions?
How long has it been there?
There's a lot of cities in Brazil.
Thank you for the answer.
It's very nice of you.
Tom asked why I was sad.
You're a victim of a betrayal.
Why should this interest us?
Ferenc arrived six times in Galeão.
Do you like the bike?
You went too far.
There's no money.
How fast!
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd go with him.
Tom didn't shoot once.
Who cares about this dog?
That's good to know.
It's me!
What a beautiful flower!
Dodgers has been betrayed by the Giants.
He's getting excited.
You don't have the right to save me!
I have to get one.
We're coming to the moon for half a million.
I don't know what they heard about Tom.
Take care of me.
This is Tatoe.
Do you know his father?
There's a lot of photos in this book.
He's suddenly named it.
That's serious enough.
Honey.
I took a new wallet.
Who's got the phone.
You can come tomorrow.
We should finish this.
The sound came from that direction.
You'll have to tell the whole story.
For everybody's unexpected.
I should've been there sooner.
I'm a cop.
I advise you to let Tommy go.
Can I take the line?
He's going to use a lot of money.
Tom's seen a snowflake.
Go, but don't worry about me.
They pay me enough.
In Athens, I was born in 1956.
It's an excellent idea.
He wasn't interested.
Why should you be so sad?
Tom's night-sucking robot.
It didn't work in Tatoe.
Now don't call me Tom.
I think I'm stupid?
Do you really want to do that?
These books?
I like the orange juice.
He's drinking another pot.
Tom, come on!
I'm here.
I'll give you a ride first.
This bus will take you to the station.
I know I should have gone earlier.
I want to be young again.
I still don't know if I can be there.
I know I can't do as well as Tom.
I've got an early end.
Hello Tamás, good morning.
Tom's been working all day without a scratch.
Tom's got a lot of enemies.
What did he tell them?
Cars are expensive.
About what?
I want to learn the truth.
There's a difference between them.
You're gonna help, aren't you?
Oh, how much you miss me!
Who made this cake?
I don't understand the question.
Honey, are you all right?
Is that normal?
How'd the movie like it?
Robbie's not with you.
Make sure Tom told you everything.
I'll tell you the truth now.
I hope I didn't break into fear.
When was this temple built?
Tomina needs you.
This muscle has a dioallergy.
I'd do it if I had more time.
He also put his books in his pockets.
Tom and Mari are wearing hats that are too big for them.
I thought I'd get through all my pockets.
Don't do it like you got a lot.
Let me explain.
Look what Tom found under the bed.
She gave him food.
It's a very big animal.
What I do, she says I can do better.
Because when I saw you, the whole room became beautiful.
Every writer is suffering from depression for the time being.
Thank you for everything.
Go through the orangeberry door.
Tom's got a fever.
Dani knew Linda that for a while she had a relationship with someone.
I think my neighbor might have died.
All of it?
I want to pick it up.
Tommy's on the channel.
I'm glad I've been waiting for him to come.
I hope you understand what I'm thinking.
What do you want?
We have to pay more.
Is the competition so bad?
Don't tell me again!
You don't have a lot of places on the table.
Then his mother thought.
Not everyone's got a high-level skills.
You decide if you don't move anymore.
If you don't want to read, don't read.
Do you know this gold?
No one talked to me.
I transferred all the money I had to buy the book.
Tominas don't have to wash their hair.
They don't speak English here.
You can get the kitchen through this door.
When his wife died, he received several dozen card cards.
I should have been a lot more basic.
I'm physically independent of my parents.
Last night, I was out in front of the TV.
This has to happen.
You understand how you can wake me up.
As soon as they arrived, the wall was completely dark, and the walls of the city were covered with sandy rocks.
It's not a joke, it's a joke!
Tom's very lucky.
Looks like the bus was ready.
Watch out for the baseball player.
Let me tell you.
Tom lied to his testimony before the court.
Five and two in the week.
No one saw my fear, just me.
We liked Tom.
It's about smoking.
You got enough time?
Pray for us to eat.
Everything hurts him.
He's got a fire on him.
Move it!
My parents are both home now.
I asked you to date me, but he didn't tell me.
That's illegal.
I'd like to look at the labyrinth contests.
The best defense is the attack.
It's gonna end.
When are you coming?
Tom doesn't know anything.
It's a pretty big box.
It's important that parents stand on one side when the line is raised.
There's another one.
They saw him pass through the street.
I'm interested in Japanese history.
Please don't tell her.
They know I do.
Tom already said.
Even though we're remarkable, he didn't want me to have sex.
You don't have to work today.
Don't ask so many.
It's a sea.
You can make a difference.
Yeah, and here's a picture of the farm where we're going.
The education did what I am.
The accident took place two hours ago.
It would have been better if you'd come with the ship.
He's got his hair cut off.
Tom's hyperventilate.
I hate to talk.
He informed the police about the traffic accident.
You're not staying here, are you?
We're ready.
I feel a lot better.
Tom lives in Boston, both of his grandparents.
Did you know his name?
Take care of yourself.
We have to get out of here.
Tommy, why don't you go to your room?
Tom moved the French lift to Germany.
Any of these can be held in the postal office.
He likes to grow up in his family.
You can't go.
I hate fantasies.
He lied about leaving with the pleasure.
The quality of translation has improved.
It won't be easy.
Don't think of me as an average person anymore.
Bob, please help get your ass into the big room.
It doesn't make sense in the past.
Is this my place or yours?
It's time!
No hope.
I'm the same.
I want to be a guitar.
Do your job!
Don't look.
We don't have time to waste a minute.
If you're around your house, what kind of roof and what buildings do you see?
Why do you have so much money?
Of course, why not?
You have to apologize.
Double or nothing?
I didn't sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You want to say something, Tom?
Tell us what it is.
Which judge examined the case?
I don't think he's gonna fly.
I'm going to be fine.
I'm meeting him today.
You're welcome, old friend.
Is anyone home?
Sleep's impossible for health.
I'll make you a sandwich if you want.
Only anyone here knows what the cold is.
It's been a year.
He's met with a rat.
It's been a while.
I'm trying to control myself.
You opened the door.
The price of this suit is nice.
She's out to go abroad.
It's a very old book.
He's always asking for your opinion.
It's round, cranky, and it's not harmonizing with anything, but at least it's not going to go into the dark.
That's a wise choice.
It's not that far away.
There are many schools in this city.
This town's got a lot of TV.
They're good cooks.
I haven't eaten anything since morning.
I'm still sad.
Do you know the name?
We should try harder.
Have you seen a bigger cap in three meters?
Who escaped?
Let's ask them.
Please give your papers at the end of the month.
That's unappreciative.
Tom, it's designed.
Do they have grandchildren?
Turn to me, please.
I love him very much.
I used to be there to get a good place.
Give the travel number and the date of birth.
I've never been able to thank you enough.
It's big.
Tommy showed Mari the way.
I need a boyfriend.
Tommy's in charge of his question.
Tomi made Marit a cup of tea.
Tell him to sit down.
They were so happy when we arrived.
What are you talking about?
It's a little bit of a rock.
I found it on the floor.
Tom's waiting.
Look at you.
It's an idea of a drink.
He explained the law to me.
I'm late.
This old building doesn't matter if it's worth the effort, it's better to get rid of it.
We can't do it anymore.
I took my shoes off.
Everyone's fine.
That's what you need.
Tom can't be used.
Hanni and Nanni.
Mary was wearing pink.
They're at home.
The white building is a hospital.
Next year, Tamás and I go to Boston.
Nice skin.
The ice cream.
That was the only thing I had to do.
There's no speed limit.
Where's my power?
You're lying to me.
You have to do it.
My mother didn't allow me to behave as a minister.
It's more important to me than to you.
When was the last time you ate the grain?
Tom didn't have a lot of money.
These are all mine.
He's not here yet.
He turned his pockets up.
There's no lift in the building, I can barely compete for my sick lands.
That's enough.
I locked the door.
The death is one of two things, or the resurrection, and the dead have no knowledge; or, as they say to us, a real change: the resurrection of the soul from that place to another.
Don't leave.
That was a stupid question.
If you steal the book, can you lend me a loan?
If you ended up telling me not to be angry, I probably wouldn't be that hot.
It's just natural.
What are you doing?
I'll take my way back to the panic.
Tom felt that it would be a waste of time to translate the letter to Mari.
At least he doesn't know anything about the animal.
Take care of yourself.
When Tom woke up, Mari fell asleep.
Get your ass out of here!
Everyone's got me.
The artist's been successful.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Is he sick or a doctor?
Tom was an iridescent child.
The air gets red in two or three weeks.
No one can live for two hundred years.
He's still calling me from time to time.
Something's wrong.
Don't be shy.
I'm asking you for a elevator close to the room.
He's probably sleeping.
The kid's gone crazy.
He must be Tom's brother.
It was you, wasn't it?
Can you tell me this man's name?

Why worry about that?
I had a bad night last night.

I really don't know where to start.
I didn't want to cry.
They're all killed.
Tom's gonna find out how things are here.
He's dancing.

What's going on in your head?
They're both dead.
Everyone's changing.

It's a personal evil motive.
If he didn't break up, don't change it.
Always the same note.
I only have a brother.
Three years ago, I met her.
We fought a lot.

You can go now.
You know almost everything about me.
When he came home, I just watched TV.
I know you're reading.
It was three hours ago.

It's very weird.
He gave me some good advice.
It's my intention to get out of the company.
I'd like you to come to the meeting.
Thank you very much.

No one understood me.
I'll take it.
Despite my apology, I'm still angry.
Maybe he'll think about it.

What do I say to Tominak?
I can't bear this pain anymore.
Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands.
Opinions combine or divide people.
This question can easily be answered.
Why is Tom doing this?
This car is bigger than that.
They've sacrificed their cells in their room.
I'm just having a drink.
Tom didn't strengthen her, or he didn't give her the pills.
I understand why Tommy's worried about this.
What's wrong?

I don't know anything except what you said to me.
We have to do something.
It's ready.
He opened the backup account.
We never lost.
They didn't report a lot of help.
How much do you pay for this room?

This is the situation.

A ship suddenly emerged from the shore.
There's no rules.
Is there anything you'd rather like?
He's got his own value.
If you don't like it, don't eat it.
The two boys were smiling at each other.
You still have to learn a lot about how to be nice.
What did you ask?
Without the Day, we could not live on Earth.
It happened soon.
Everyone knows the law.

He asked for help.
You know I love Tom, right?
There's no end until we're too close to him.
Tom wants to do it.
Good day.
I left my horse.
I owe Tom a gift.
Tommy looked at the dog.
I don't understand how I do it.
It's broken.
He's going with my sister.
I'll buy it every morning.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It's not a secret.
Tom's got it.
Tom wanted to see what was going on.
Don't touch me!
Tom is my bookmaker.
He killed your cat.
I'll pray for Tommy.
It wasn't easy for me.
He was finally late.
Take care, don't eat.
He's grown up and he's been talking.
It's a terrible plan.
I feel very much about you.
That's what you need.
There's nothing special about it.
Don't give me your clothes today.
I just have to look at the food, and I'm getting enough.
Who are those guys?
I'm sure he'll be fine with my grandmother.
There's our dad!
I was too serious.
Look what you're saying.
Let's examine the case.
I'd like a Vanilla cover.
Tommy's in trouble.
I'm going to the office with the exception of those early days.
The dead bastard gave a terrible vision under the bridge.
Tom was obviously unhappy.
The body for milk.
Tom wants Mari to be happy.
They named their sons Janos.
Tommy wanted Mari to answer some questions from the past.
Have you been in the basement yet?
What do you think he'll do?
It was a good beer.
He forgot his return.
Don't be surprised, things will be solved.
True friendship is much easier than a gym.
I know why Tom was killed.
You're probably hungry.
A temporary detachment can take place in a pilot's life.
I have to go to the office.
How'd the test go?
Let's not go back to the guest.
Do you have love?
I saw your name on the list.
I'd like to speak Spanish.
You didn't have the right to do this.
It's a very easy task for him.
He didn't like my answer.
Tommy's got a piece of shit out of his ass.
Tom's advice isn't too good.
You took a little force, didn't you?
Did Tom tell you how he did it?
I'll be there for the girl.
Maria accepted the offer.
The plant needs rain.
Tom, can I get this?
What do I say to Tominak?
English is taught in most countries.
Whatever you say, don't lose your head.
The conversation was held in secret and used as evidence.
Doctors don't know what's wrong with Tamás.
I don't know what Tom is doing in Australia.
They didn't steal anything.
He's taking care of the dinner.
This isn't the right solution.
I kept it in the dark.
He was born in a small village in southern Turkey.
Look down.
It seems that Europe now is Hungary.
You're already part of it?
They're listening.
My dad's really tired.
I couldn't stop crying.
Tom took care of Mary's cake.
Tom got out of his pockets.
All rights reserved.
Where did Tom live before he moved to Australia?
If I could, I'd read it all the time.
We know only one simple part of my world.
It's also good in your pockets.
Tom's been killed by the assault.
Tom doesn't want to.
It was a brother-in-law.
Get out of here!
Tom's injuries aren't serious.
Is there enough time?
They're angry.
Mary's less active than her sister.
Don't come in!
I couldn't stop crying aloud.
Tom's probably still excited.
That's what makes you change your life for everyone.
My father died five years ago.
Why did you ask?
Tom advised Mary not to ask too much money from John.
It's not as protective as it sounds.
Call the security service.
My dad suggested we go to the music today.
You know where I live.
The cat's got two feet.
You want to see a French movie, don't you?
Everyone's worried.
These sons of bitches are like two eggs.
They sold one.
Your name doesn't come to me.
It's made of the piano player.
They've changed a lot.
We're all here.
I started Frankenstein with my own hands.
It's much better than yesterday.
I'm not hungry at all.
We're not kids anymore.
We've been through a number of times.
I was naive.
I've been dating Tommy for Christmas.
How's your sister?
They need food and water.
It's important for me to win.
There's something to eat.
Thank you, Betty, but she didn't take anything.
Tom's gone.
They chose us.
I have nothing to do with the past, not the future.
When you're good enough to join the group, we'll let you go.
I want a new dog.
I'm just speaking French.
Honey, I'd like to take you out of the woods.
When did you get here?
I'm not mad at you.
I'm glad I did.
Don't be afraid of the unexpected, but be prepared for it.
Tom doesn't need anyone.
I want to know what's going on here.
The man's dick is the biceps.
This is your only chance.
Did you tell Tominak?
You know how to use this machine?
I never thought I'd ever get used to doing that.
He's a great cook.
The room is at the end of the journey.
Am I clear?
It's from the BLT room, health and paradise.
From my point of view, the plan seems very good.
It's important.
I want to run for the president's honour.
Did they speak French at home?
I'm more.
- Where did you come from, sir?
Dick promised to be back in three hours.
Well, think about what you want, 'cause you can be real.
What kind of medicine is this?
I don't think you're right, but I know you're right.
Tomot's life has been taken.
We're here, no!
The change is inevitable.
Tom's late.
Unfortunately, my husband doesn't belong among the things he knows.
I didn't take it completely.
He went to check on his parents.
I'm sure you understand.
My dad wants me to join Tom.
I'm in a bad mood and I don't smoke.
It's his.
Tom's dead.
I don't know why you're sorry.
Let me talk to Tommy.
Is it?
Let's move a little to have fun.
If you were working yesterday, you'd be a free day today.
I've just made a toast.
Looks like they're in trouble.
He's seen another shot.
At least he didn't make it.
I know how to win.
You've got the shit out of your ass.
What's your family situation?
I think you should go in personally.
I'm not even sure I want to see that movie.
Tom's been here a few days later.
He didn't want to hurt me.
Who should I talk to?
It's a dog's throat.
Although he's 38, he's still dependent on his parents.
You look different.
I'm aware of your risks.
How do cousins communicate with their parents?
I asked my son what he really wanted.
It's too much to think about.
I love the foci.
I have a suggestion.
Tom stopped me from doing what I wanted to do.
They have children.
We live on this long road.
I don't have a clue about my part.
I'm sorry, but we didn't get this done.
Show me your face.
Look back!
One of Tom's friends stole his identity.
Why do you want to be an asshole?
Don't bother them, and they won't bother you.
Tom's dressed in white.
That's just gonna be a chance, so don't worry about it.
I've turned into a little lucky.
You're the most important person in my life.
The eye wasn't.
I've never spoken to Tommy in France.
You're kidding?
Let's read it.
The fear of flying is a serious obstacle to his career.

If you pay the mortgage, you get a monkey.
I'll listen to you like a bitch.
He's sleeping in the river.
You're crazy.
You're all fucked up.
Even the kids know that.
Don't go home yet!
I'll see you there tonight.
This is my life!
Looks like no one noticed anything.
Maybe Tom will never leave.
That's terrible.
I don't want to grow up.
Our forces took over the city.
He's dancing on the side of the tower.
It didn't hurt.
It never should have happened.
Because I'm close to Christmas, I have to get some stuff.
The decision was cancelled.
I'm writing a competition for freedom.
I should have followed your advice.
There's no one in life.
Tom didn't dare go to bars.
She likes the dress, too.
Take him to the bottom.
I don't like it.
I'm very good at it.
Give me this note.
That's a seven-word statement.
The hotel is 20 euros per night.
It was Chinese for a while.
Tom felt great about himself.
You've got to get the fuck out of here.
Bob's gone.
Wait for your turn, Tom.
He finally got away from me.
I don't have a child.
I think you know the rules.
We'll have to get up at 7:00 a.m.
Don't give up!
I'm sure Tom's gonna be in a coma.
China's land.
He needs to see death in his person.
He brought her around to my request in the new product.
I really hope this isn't a bad joke.

It's like Tommy's dreaming.
I feel very strong.
It's not the wind today.
I'm not as young as you think.
You two are funny.
They're their good friends.
We don't like Tommy.
I bought a box of chocolate.
I want to play.
The brains protect your astronauts from the spread of your brain.
The man's a soldier.
Where's the man?
The old man died last week.
I love the order, but it's not the earthquake.
Do you have a date with someone?
Tom has to win.
How happy I am!
I'm serious.
I'll get it.
This book is really old.
We feel very good about ourselves.
Maybe I'll be ready.
Turned off the picture.
Let's follow the others.

Tom appreciates modern art.
Give me back my wallet!
The phone's over!
Tom asked if I was hungry.
You made it.
A little more?

He didn't say a word.
I doubt Tom would do this.
We're three hours away from Sao Paulo.
Tom called it easy on his face.
Don't deal with him, Tom.
Tom gave me this book.
Give me half the money for the toughest times.
I didn't have any pain.
He studied the original text of War and Peace.
I live in New Zealand.
How'd you like my dinner where you ate last night?
Now you're sleeping with Tommy.
They won't understand.
He's a hero.
You know what?
The blood ran in the yard.
It's too often happening.
There's a shower before me.
I'll go back to my chair.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
It's more fun in this box than in the other one.
Can I pay for the check?
In England, they say "a lot like a lord", but in Russia, they say "a lot like a wizard."
Shut the fuck up!
Did the cats get to sleep?
Good thing you can see.
Or you're my fault.
Tom stole your money.
I greeted Betty, but she didn't pay attention to me.
It's a powerful symbol.

Tell me what you think I should do.
Don't let your job go indefinitely.
I saw it.
The cats hate the water.

Tom and Mari went to the show festival.
Well, you're not responsible.
We need to keep working.

I didn't count on any gifts.
You find that bastard?
Am I a fountain?
He's obviously broken up.
I am alive today.
Tom left it in the field.
This is the best book I've ever read.
Sami was funny, but the same thing happened.

Oh, my God!
It's almost over.
That's what I'm saying. It was a half-circuited beer.
Stay out of sight.
Why did you ask me this, Tom?
No one can know what the future holds.
We'll keep the train.
Maybe Tom shouldn't do that.
Don't worry about it, Tommy.
It's a historical color.
My parents were my cousins.
I went to my mother.

The details are still being completed.
Stay away!
Stop trying.
There is no absolute truth.
Is that still there?

He took off his clothes.
Tom thought about everything.
He started it.
Stay there and you'll see better.
Tommy's not the guy who learns from his mistakes.
First, please show yourself in three minutes.
- Who's the man?
What did he do?
Do you like oranges?
Tom should never have done that.
I thought if we were going somewhere to eat, we'd get a drink.
That wasn't enough.
The country.
I don't have any more fun than I do with you.
I took half a thousand of it.
Looks like Tommy's totally busy.
Let's do some help.
Can you help me with my school job?
It's time for the money to be accepted.
I think it's right.
There's no entrance door.
Wait a second.

You're welcome.
What a beautiful night!

He likes to be killed.
I should have asked Tom for help.
How much do you mean?
During his conversation with the man, he listened carefully.
He'll win the first prize.
I think you like it.
We don't have to waste time.
One with that?

It's really good for you to call.
I love Christmas lights.
Obviously, it's very painful.
Is that still alive?
Let's go to hell.
You weren't ready.
- It's just a buyer.
Her doctor wants to send her to a nurse.
We're going back to the water.
Tom is more fun than Mary.
There's a lot of tattoos in the body.
He's been a nurse in his third year.
Who made these pictures?
These oranges are broken.
I'm doing my coffee.
Tommy says he doesn't want to wait for you.
Would you like to visit Chichen Itza?
It's working on my budget.
I love music, too.
I want to do well.
Tom's been good at school.
They're our good friends.
Tom didn't know what to answer.
Don't be less satisfied.
By the way, let's start.
Why are these girls so cruel?
I still need to get some breakfast.
My mother was very afraid of the baby's fun.
Don't you want to think about yourself?
It's a complete match.
It's a big mistake.
Both of us have the same problem.
Tom constantly opposed himself.
Mom, look!
I really agree with Tommy.
That's a good idea.
I went to Boston by car.
If you think about it, you know where to find it.
I don't like dogs.
We just ate.
It's urgent.
He's right in the bathroom.
I don't have the guts.
Do you have a volunteer?
It's not perfect.
They're listening.
God is helping us.
Remember him.
It's really good for you to call.
Would you excuse me, please, where did you make the key?
I got it.
We'll be there.
He's also the group leader.
That's what I want.
I need to defeat Tom.
I don't think they like it.
Tom was very excited about the inside.
From the beginning, I didn't want to live in a big city.
Tom's got a shot.
Tom's always fucking leaving his purse.
I can't just leave.
Looks like you thought about everything.
That day my life changed.
People are part of nature?
You need to be careful.
You know I don't like tobacco.
I wish it was my car.
Tommy couldn't help Mari.
Do you know the name of Tommy's family?
I've tried to catch up with the alarming cry.
My wife's family is very rich.
Tell Tomina I'm coming back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the fire.
Tom, open the door!
The boy's got a knife in his hand. He's gonna be on his chest.
I want to go there.
I want to thank you for our great work.
We hope not.
You've learned a lot from your French language.
Tom won't believe what you're saying to him.
Tommy got five in the exam.
Tommy's word is against Mari's word.
I don't have time to talk now.
Have you been in Mexico yet?
There's coffee there.
You can't buy the respect.
Tom's gone.
Tom's dead.
You never should've left before.
This book is used in Spanish.
Health is more important than economy.
That's what Tom told me.
I'm hungry.
I'm not talking to Tom.
I think everyone else should have a diet.
What do we do first?
I don't know.
Can you suggest another date?
I gave it up too early.
What are you gonna do there?
That's perfectly normal.
What else?
Let me go first.
Tommy's been away for about three minutes.
All right.
Let's try it.
Tom insisted on paying for his dinner.
Take a glass cake.
I need an egg.
Samuel's gone.
I like to travel alone.
We don't want this.
My guitar's in the car pack.
We're sitting there.
He's got the water and he's broken.
Everybody's scared.
That's right.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's not perfect.
The former hunters left the place in an irregular manner.
Shut up!
His mind is completely out of the truth.
Some people look like others just because they have less money.
She's got the poor little girl.
Tom didn't show too much interest.
Your job is over.
Now I want to pay.
I'd like to ask you something.
I've answered the question.
Maria solved the secret.
Do you have any water?
How can I stop Tom?
Tom is here right now.
I usually eat with my family at home.
It shouldn't have been.
We can't prove anything.
You can live in that hole.
Tom was involved, so Mary got home with the car.
I don't speak English.
Tom organized a great success.
Tom was a cop.
We've seen a castle before us.
Have you seen Tom when he's watching?
Tommy seemed surprised.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Don't deal with them!
I was sorry to see you in Australia.
They do the same things as I did as a child.
That's great!
I'll take it from the living room.
Mary's gone to the gym.
The report was intended to be prepared, and it was a mistake to correct it.
Tom's not rich, he's not famous.
Everybody's gone crazy.
Tom's on the criminal record.
I'm coming to Boston tomorrow night.
He called me personally.
I have to go.
I'll look after some dinner.
He can't stop.
I learned so much about Tom.
That's why I need a job.
He's still sleeping.
Cocksucker.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very nice.
I'm sick too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit back!
I don't know where I am.
Tom didn't do anything.
He's very proud of his ability.
Did you live in a remote?
All roads were set off from the plane.
It needs a red toll.
He didn't know what to do with the problem.
I'm sad now.
My dad's on his way to work.
Where's Tommy?
Don't be so sensitive.
I'm five miles away today.
I never understood Tom.
We had to be there.
Tom made breakfast.
She's probably the youngest teacher in the class.
You should have called the cops.
I'll keep it secret.
Tom hasn't escaped uninterrupted yet.
You gave me your coffee.
I couldn't have done better myself.
Tom has been a member of this club for three years.
In my career, it's so small that I don't have the right to get hurt.
Go home!
I'm not an idiot.
You found my cat.
I thought Tom was coming.
He who loves the flowers can't be a bad man.
Einstein says everything is visible.
The old book was crazy.
They're just grown up.
About as tall as you.
That's right, Tom.
It's important that we help them get into trouble.
Old dog, you can't teach new tricks anymore.
I have to let the power go.
I love your language.
I understand what you're thinking.
They've got ten-year-olds.
Tell him you love him before it's too late.
Would you lend me the book if you were done with it?
I told you that.
The disaster would cause disaster in the workplace.
What do you think of my idea?
Give me a little time to find out what happened.
Tom's not afraid of death.
There's not enough information.
There's a forest in my house.
The bus also started.
There's the largest lake in Turkey.
The radio's broken.
There are still no houses on the other side of the road.
Besides, who's got to wait for his turn...
I don't know about it.
Tom looked at his teeth.
It's getting smaller.
Tom does that to everyone.
Are you coming in?
We'll change this soon.
I don't want to talk about time.
My request was rejected.
We've got news on the news since we heard it.
Don't underestimate yourself.
I'm Antonio.
I met my friend here.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I like to kiss Tom.
Tommy and my son.
He's a stranger.
You can't know the truth.
Tom is also growing up in the light of the most critical observation.
Believe it or not, that's the truth.
I didn't go without it.
He worships his brother.
Where else should we go?
If you don't like it, you can go.
Tom's gonna pay.
I see.
Tom just gave up.
I don't want to see him.
You need to get out of here if you want to eat anything.
Dad's still in bed.
Do you have to work on Sundays?
We've made it feel good.
We haven't had any problems yet.
What color is your hair?
In the room where you're sitting, I sat last night.
You're not a good man.
I hope Tommy will understand.
You think in your eyes?
I thought I could trust myself.
The sound's gone.
Co-operation is for the brains.
The moon entered the whole city during one night.
I'll explain later.
Honestly, I don't really care.
The truth is the best year of life.
Tom's gone?
They called the zoo because there was no other doctors in the village.
I know what I want.
Don't let him touch her.
Shut up!
Are you working on Saturday?
How much are you talking about?
The uncle's got his hands tied to the finals.
I live in Milan.
Tom can come any time.
I think time will solve this problem.
Why did your pool go together?
I'd rather stay home and watch TV.
Tom's Christian?
Ask Tama to explain it.
You did it together.
I slept on the open window because of the heat.
It's been a long day.
He's lost his sister.
Let's go to the movie.
I want to believe you!
A Nazi killed a Jew.
We don't know exactly.
If you want to get out of here, listen to me.
We've learned a lot of French instead.
That's amazing!
Is that what everyone wants?
You're breaking up with me?
You can't believe a word.
I love the Spanish!
I'm gonna go get a ride to get my head down.
A little work doesn't cost anyone.
A girl is as strong as her eyes.
You called me on the phone.
I'm going to report to the worker today.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
My father traveled to Greece.
I've got a lot of braber knowledge.
The King has defeated his enemies.
You're talking!
I want Mary to let Tommy finish it.
I'm tired.
We have a big problem.
You're too busy to drive.
His eyes were cut off from the cry.
You're going there without me.
Tom's gonna laugh.
It's not a secret.
I was wrong about this.
Take it, please.
We'll do it together.
I forgot, could you help me, please?
He saw Tommy Mária smile.
It's just to get the eight-hour watch.
They considered him a hero because he saved his friend's life.
Your father would be proud of you, too.
I'm just asking for a few seconds.
I don't understand why I love Tom so much.
Tomina's alive to see.
He promised me he'd come to four.
I don't want to lose this game.
In general, the education system.
They're there.
Hello.
Tom's got a plate on his phone.
I don't like to wake up.
She also thought that Maria had material problems.
When I hear the news, I'm going to be a lesbian, so how can there be such a dangerous thing?
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Why do we deal with what happens after we die?
We need to help each other.
Sometimes my dream is real.
He transferred all the money I gave him.
I thought we were neighbors.
You think I should tell Tom?
What does that mean to you?
You know how to do this?
My father's doctors.
How old is yours?
I don't have a word.
Who loves Tom?
Kill Tom!
I think I'm dying.
What's up?
Tom's got a heart attack on his head.
We're crazy.
You're more comfortable than you think.
Did you see my camera?
Tom did a lot of great things.
I was really busy.
It's all right.
Don't be shy anymore.
That's why you're gonna pay for it.
It would be good if we had a collection of the last words of famous people.
I'm a social worker.
The arrest was amazing.
I believe your word.
Different?
Tom's got as many services as he needs.
Tom wants to be successful.
Nothing happened.
You were in the library yesterday morning?
I like her better.
He signed ten books, but he didn't mean any of them.
Tom's home with his parents.
I don't really want to eat now.
Tom was satisfied with his success.
They didn't find anyone.
You can do this.
You don't take much time.
I hate the lawyers.
Tom said you hate to dance.
If you have time, why don't you go into your gallery?
At first, I was nervous, but then I got a lot of rest.
I don't want to win this kind of couch.
First, you have to ask Tom.
Explain to me.
I'm clean with trouble.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
He's left somewhere in the mountains.
Tom went to the address.
Tom put you in his pocket.
I feel something terrible is going to happen.
Is that it?
Tom's not married.
No one's there.
We were honest.
Tom admired Mari.
I didn't realize you weren't speaking French.
I had two dogs.
They have absolutely different opinions than I do.
We can't save everyone.
Tom's asleep.
Where's the tree when there's no rain?
This is one of the best places in town.
I just need a travel adjustment.
Tom should have been dancing.
I left it out of my mind.
The gas dropped, the rain poured down the lake.
You look very tired.
Bring him in.
Help Tamás.
I've been looking for a lot of money in the crash.
I'll tell Tom what he should tell Mari.
I haven't eaten yet.
I accept your terms.
I'm a good cook.
It's dangerous!
Can I open my eyes?
The car's white.
I was sick, I stayed home all day.
Tom was born in Boston.
Can you wait a minute?
There's eight feet for the cops.
I'm still a child.
Tom's looking at the women.
That's crazy.
I work as a bus driver.
I think you know him.
That'll be enough.
We didn't have dinner.
I'm done with it.
But I'm going to deliver the message to Tomina.
Mari was too sensitive to express her feelings.
Tom should've done a lot better.
What kind of songs were they singing?
I'm going home to Boston.
Already, or not?
When Mr. Harrison was in bed with his leg, he was in a coma, and he had a heart attack.
I don't like learning French today.
Tom's very orderly.
Let's go, but without me.
I was proud to be trusted in Tommy.
What kind of beer is it?
That was a secret.
I trust you.
Good to see you in the morning.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents don't live anymore.
Not all black and white.
You have no right to judge these people.
He's obviously grown up.
Tom and Mary made the same arrangements.
Let's discuss this.
Don't you want to buy me?
The water's not healthy.
Can you pull up with a hand?
Tom has a brother.
He's here to protect you.
Looks like Tom was very worried.
Tomina's got blood in her lungs.
There's a book on the table.
It is important that we promote our language in every way possible.
When's the next time?
I guess I don't understand him.
Anytime, you can ask me anything.
I love you.
This isn't your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
There's two old men in front of our house.
They're drunk.
The gangs have been hit by a long, green hair.
I don't know anyone in the picture.
I hope we don't cause you discomfort.
Let's get this out of here.
You're learning another chemistry.
He keeps his word.
You don't count on any special treatment.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't make enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I won't go through the morning exam.
It's okay.
The new building's here today.
Lora!
I've never seen that in my life.
I'll call Tom right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
I hope things will be fine.
Paul's perfect.
You replaced the demand with Margarin.
It was popular in the 1990s.
Everyone did it.
People like oranges in the aquarium?
I live in a small house, not too far from here.
Tom was in danger.
I'm sorry, can I help you?
The paragraph that the teacher asked Sarah to read was not interesting.
Tommy and Mari are both good teachers.
Tom gave Mari his number.
There's a guy in Rod John's house.
The lift's very cool.
There's no money for this to be sold.
Tom would've eaten.
Tell Tom you to meet us at the station.
It's an invitation.
I'm glad to see you again.
Tom was a good job.
Everyone has the right to be stupid, and some of these rights come back.
I just need some encouragement.
Dani knew Linda was gone.
I'm not the man I've ever been.
I'm not a Catholic.
Let's stay here.
Our money's gone.
I don't want to ride with you.
I don't understand anything.
What's the price for this bag?
I came from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more space.
Tom taught me most of what I know in French.
Shall we drink something?
He keeps his money in the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard for everyone to get into it.
There's a solution.
What do you think Tom is looking for?
Well, there's no such thing.
This world is dominated by evil forces.
He's called to put fear in him.
I'm on my way.
Can I have a round-down tone of heart?
Don't touch it.
The story was real.
The pain has been removed from the pain after the emotional effect has passed.
That's what I need.
How much money do you have?
Concentrate!
They don't talk at all.
It's a shame!
He's always asking for your opinions.
We're going to use it instead.
I'm very pleased with this song.
When both do the same, it's not the same anymore.
I'm not the one with Tom's problem.
How much money is Tom gonna get?
Is it true that Tom was after suicide?
Serbia bordered Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.
You can follow his advice, too.
My name is Ricardo, is it yours?
Maria's talking in a dream.
I don't think that's ever going to happen again.
This is yours, Tom!
Give me another beer.
My shoes are stuck in the motorbike.
What's the taste of the dresser?
He's also speaking French.
I'm on it.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain it.
Tom went to bed a few years ago.
We're all safe.
I was sure.
Take it easy!
Two bottles of wine were left.
Come on, tomorrow!
Can we try this?
The table's green.
Tom had to win the competition.
I need him to be exaggerating.
I'm still not there to follow.
I don't want to know.
The race often gives us what we don't expect.
What's the recipe?
We're competitive.
Give me a painkiller, please.
You're completely lost.
He's very tired, so he hasn't come to school today.
Something's wrong.
They'll talk tomorrow.
This table looks up.
Open it!
Do you understand English?
He used to have to see the clock.
Tom took part in a web interview.
Do you have any sense of injury?
It's hard to steal a towel.
Tommy can't ever get out of the shed.
Tell me, where's the police?
He was so tired, he lived alone.
I hope I'll start learning your beautiful language in the near future.
Tom was so paranoid.
I need numbers.
I count to three.
Don't talk.
Tommy didn't even know how to thank France for something.
Where's the next medicine?
I did.
Tom and Mari are as different as fire and water.
Tommy's a good speaker.
We have less than three hours.
Tom's parents were hippies.
That's a mistake.
This car looks like mine.
How stupid you are!
Maybe it makes sense to me, but not to me.
Don't try to be late.
No one knows everything.
He's a bus driver.
Don't be one.
But that's not the real problem.
What's the name of the book?
Tom loved me.
You tell us the truth?
Russia is big.
Who's the woman there?
Tom's got a headache.
Tom was the most influential man in town.
I'm looking forward to getting married.
Is it cold in Germany?
Leave my camera alone.
You have to be careful.
Don't ask her to help you more.
I'm not coming.
Thank you.
Let's get a girl in there.
It's not a fish.
Did you know them personally?
Tom doesn't look too happy, does he?
Please, tell me more.
You have to keep your eyes open.
Tomina's got a black cat.
Courage is born with courage and trust friendships.
It's back to the old story.
Tom took Mary a box of cookies.
My fate is in your hands.
Let's talk about something else.
The light went out, and we stayed in the dark.
I'm planning to rent my room.
The storm stopped, and it wasn't gonna happen anymore.
He accused them of stealing.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I decided I'd join the firemen.
Tom stopped, but then he stopped again.
I love your dress.
I wouldn't go out today.
That woman is the present's wife.
I'll get the letter.
I feel much better today.
The train's here right now.
You can't do anything wrong by learning a language.
Shut up, or I'll get out of here.
Is everything ready?
I have to go.
I don't get it.
Nothing proves their existence.
The mathematical exchangers just have to prove what we're doing.
I'm a cooperative.
He was afraid of injustice at best.
No one knows what will happen in the future.
Good morning, my dear.
What do you think of modern art?
It's not Tom's name.
It's a good day for the heat.
He's the oldest boy in our class.
Tom's in the bathroom, isn't he?
Rome hasn't been built in a day.
How old were you when you started learning French?
What happened to the money?
We need to protect ourselves from all attempts to lose our freedom.
You've broken the ten.
What did you do last night?
We're a tree!
Tom's heart was not clean.
Do you have my book?
Please think about it.
Tom did what he liked.
I see the light.
I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
You're worse than me.
Don't touch me here all the time.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
He's a farmer.
You can't always win.
It's an ice cream.
I can't feel myself.
God be with you!
I'm out of here.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
The road is full of cats.
What does the news say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If time allows, let's go picnic.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
- Who are these stars?
I'm convinced that I'm benefiting from this tennis match.
I went to Boston.
You're one of us.
It's amazing what I know.
They've got two sides of the line.
We're boys.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Would you give me an example of this?
But I have to give you a message.
He said he didn't know.
It's worse than we thought.
You know my secrets.
You've lost your tattoos.
I swear to you, that's why they're in trouble.
He told the boys to get involved.
We have twelve children.
It's my wish to read the novels.
You're going to get used to it.
I don't know why Tommy went to the hospital.
The prices have been reduced.
I'm not afraid to wait.
We helped each other.
That was when he was out.
Tom opened the door to green.
Just start working.
Sure, I'm happy.
Tom hit Mary's car.
Let's take a look.
You're the most important person in my life.
But the proposed changes were against each other.
I sat on this tree.
Tom's released.
Can I have the full name?
Uncsi!
I'll tell you what you're saying.
I told you this wouldn't be good.
Tom gave Mary a kiss.
Don't yell, don't yell.
Here's your passport.
I saw one.
What's your business?
Chief Tom Mary.
Small or not, there's no way they can find all the real couples.
They left Tom in prison.
Nice to meet you.
Tommy didn't mean one with Mari.
I'm trying to break your mouth.
Is this a trap?
I met Tom and Mary.
Is this a joke?
There's a military base nearby.
You have to do this.
I'm having a bad day.
All right, people, let's go!
Tom went on a trip with his friends.
I heard Tommy and Mari get married in October.
The white needle is as hard as the purple.
You have to be here.
There you go with the car?
I don't think that's enough.
Tommy's got you water on the roof.
Tom tried to reduce his costs.
Tommy told the dog to sit down.
Don't you think Tommy's never coming back?
Because you know him.
You don't have to talk to me all the time.
Tomina's gonna need it.
He's like a king to me.
He looks like a hero.
I came from Japan.
I saw Dana.
Tom's good for the animals.
I didn't register.
The bread you made in the air, white, not pink.
I'm always looking after you.
Tom's getting back.
I'll work every day.
You look like you're mad.
We need to stop him now.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm afraid of Tommy.
I'm glad we agreed on something.
Then the bear went down to the talisman's bag, threw her beads, and touched her with the glass bottle that the bosorcan gave her. Within a moment, she changed her skin into a beautiful, yellow-skinned balir, and the taliska passed through the back of her hand, which she wore with two tanctograms of parillas.
Don't make a mistake.
Don't you get it now?
The books offer their time.
Is he tall?
I'll wait for Tomira.
I heard you're not going home.
I'm going to take your vows to death.
I am now a young man.
The police found a dead body in an unplanned car near the park.
Sure, he can do it.
Our solar system is in the middle of the sun.
You're done?
She's been working all her life.
We spent 15 miles that day.
Tom can't make him take a babysitter.
Get up!
I washed my hair last night.
I'm finally sleeping.
Cathy stopped the fruiting.
The number of traffic accidents increases from year to year.
Start living.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
He was following the murder of the man.
Many will die.
The next link comes to the 2nd floor and goes to Shibuya at 4:35.
You did?
What are they doing there?
Would you like a cup of tea?
Is there any more of this?
I can't find my other treasure.
Tom's sharing.
The apples take care of the patient at night.
People don't look special today when a man grows his hair a long time ago.
A boy grabbed my wallet when I got in his pocket.
Who do you trust?
Here's my e-mail address.
You know how to help me get a cab?
Tominak was an alibi.
I know whether he's an enemy or not.
Can I do something for you?

Looks like it's okay.
We're teachers.
Sometimes in advance.
In the morning the god is red, the global rise, the god is red, the reactor is only god.
You want to sleep a little?
You're drinking from my cup.
Tom remembered himself.
I didn't tell Tomina.
Tell me how I can help.
You speak English pretty well.
It's fun.
What are you reading?
Be willing to help.
They're both evicted.
One of us has to do it.
I'd like to kiss you.
Make sure you don't mess with me here.
I've got the case right now.
What caused the accident?
It's the queen's infamous.
I don't have a good place to go.
I'm a cop.
Let's see how he's going.
I'm Tom and dependent.
Tom wanted to be good.
Best feeders are homogenous.
Can you explain the difference between black and green tea?
We need a ride.
That's what I've been doing all day.
Whoever wants to see the arrows, he's gonna have to take the balls off.
I don't want meat.
What's more worth, time or money?
The world's been on the top of the roof.
I'm thinking about it.
It doesn't matter now.
Don't get away with it.
He forgot his non-smokers.
What's the problem?
I need blood.
Why did they kill Tom?
It's probably simple.
Aren't you ready?
Well, when I was ready to call, a letter came from him.
Titto?
Tom is a very serious friend of mine.
I don't even like him if he does.
He's always asking the opinions.
It's our youngest daughter.
Jim loves his girlfriend very much.
I want your lawyer.
He's doing something on his own.
He's just practicing mountain climbing.
We'll protect you.
I want my beer dictionary back, and now.
Be a good boy.
He got hurt in a car accident.
What happened to you?
Let's drink another beer.
I brought you today, but you weren't home.
I'll inform Tommy.
You're better than me.
You're kidding me, aren't you?
I'll go home.
He doesn't speak English at all.
You know what's going to happen?
He kept it secret that he took a bicycle for his son.
I'm sorry I haven't written that long.
I've been pregnant already.
Tom has no right to our family alone.
How far is it?
You're starting to panic.
Close the world!
We have visitors.
Where's your gun?
He wants to know everything about you.
Why do the wounds appear suddenly with the cousin's closet?
Why are you speaking French?
Before I go home, I'm drinking a couple of drinks.
They live near the cave.
I have two positions.
Tom and Mary were interviewed.
He's gone.
I don't understand his way of thinking.
That's why people get so drunk.
Tom called Mary a joke.
Put the gun down!
Who's the record?
I wasn't wrong.
You remember me.
They didn't believe me.
How many rooms are in your house?
I speak Spanish.
Why didn't you call me before you came?
He was less interested than I thought he was.
This bank always keeps its own interests in mind.
When do you put the Christmas songs down?
Feel at home.
Was Tom busy?
This or Tom or John has to be.
How do you get your name?
The cat's dead while the dolphin's gone.
How much are the oranges going?
Does anyone know how to strengthen this?
He doesn't sleep at night because he's trying to save his weak business.
Not a word.
Do you know why God is angry?
I know how to use rehab.
Layla received a text message from Sami.
It's a problem.
The boys will be happy.
I'm not doing it for the money.
Tom doesn't understand one with Mary.
It could be love.
I hope so.
I like the album very much.
I don't know any of them.
It's closed.
Did you hear about the fire last night?
I know what I did.
I think you're already packed and ready for the launch.
It's hard to believe it's been clean and it's time.
Most people are very upset when they have to talk before the public.
Run!
When did you work in Boston?
No one knew who did this.
What are you talking about?
How old are you?
Let's go to class.
Tom's shy.
There are people who can easily be affected.
I don't understand why I can't do that.
It's not a bad idea.
Which direction are you going to?
Tom's listening.
There's no evidence.
I think you'll be fine.
There's no one there.
We're going back to our kids. They're coming back.
Can I have some fun?
I'm coming to help you.
He came to Tokyo in his early teens.
I don't like the sea.
What's the question?
The mollusks are unhindered.
I took my cat to the zoo last night.
Tom wanted Mary to help her in the kitchen.
There's a phone in my room.
They're up to looking for a fortune.
Everyone's alive.
John started the car.
Please explain.
Who cares for the kids?
This room is cold.
All the students are home.
You know enough.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Business is business.
You should talk to your mother more often.
We're not so stupid about it.
It's a huge, unpredictable woodpecker.
You can bring water to the lake, but you can't see it.
When does the music start?
She's not going to win anything in her life.
I'll find your way of thinking.
People believe in God.
Tom and Mary tried not to be too loud.
Look what you did to me.
That woman's coming.
You're bad.
Tom's the best boy in school.
When were you the best?
That's my favorite painting.
Now, stop trying to explain it.
I'm going to die.
Will that affect me?
I'm always drinking two cupcakes in the morning.
I got Tom out of his book.
I don't know where Tom's cousin is.
It's the last one.
I'm running all the rest of my life this morning.
That was great.
Maybe I'll sleep later if I'm very hungry.
Is there anything between you guys?
Don't ask why, just do it.
My dream is that I'll be a teacher.
It's very nice of you.
How long have you been going to breakfast?
Give me this fruit.
There was something wrong with this.
We'll get to our pictures.
Don't stay with him for a while.
Oh, no!
I'd rather go there with a bike than I'd run.
Tamás and Maria said they don't like dogs.
Tom made a lot of progress this week.
Are you really sending me a Japanese baby?
I didn't go to Australia with Tommy.
We'll wait.
I didn't mean to tell you that.
He's just reading a book.
He's too serious.
As far as I know, he never made such a mistake.
I'll take the car.
We don't live together.
You're going to die.
They'd love to.
They won't succeed.
I helped Tom.
I've got a table made of wood.
We're gone.
The cat's adorable.
How's everybody doing?
If this really hits the pump in you, maybe it's time for you to get out.
Can you forgive me?
Who's staying?
I want to learn French for the next time.
I'm really busy with kids.
Tom is 13 years old, but he still believes in Mikulas.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I hope I can see him again.
Tom made us all happy.
She lives in a state of bivalves and a Russian bravery.
It worked so well.
There are more houses behind the houses.
The whole sea was full of dragons.
It's been in the ocean. It's full.
Please don't go away.
Tom can't stop.
It was my fault.
Is that dangerous?
Tom's gonna take Mari to the airport.
He lives in another state.
I work to live, but I don't live to work.
Stay right there.
He knows everything about raising.
My dad's got a box of candy in his gifts.
Tommy used to call Marit?
She was self-indicated.
Tom knew everything.
Come with me.
I can't forgive you.
I think you called a bad number.
My mom got out of the box.
The movie's unalmal.
Tell me what's my choice?
The pictures will talk for themselves.
Tommy invited them to sit down.
Tom doesn't like kids.
Write it as soon as possible.
Who's in charge of your shoes?
German is the best language in the world.
Tom should have been a lawyer.
Of course she's my sister.
Please fill in this paper and wait for our notification.
I'll take you to the station.
Never ask me to help you again!
Where are your kids now?
I'm so sorry.
I still have a lot of time to play.
You're talking to Tom.
Tell them everything you know.
Of course!
Is there a raise here?
Where am I now?
Tom got sick of the food.
Here's the address.
Tommy's got the ring from Maritolo.
Mari hasn't married her.
There's a page missing.
Where can I get my wallet?
A month ago he went to London.
I don't like your friend.
He's not here today.
He took the farmer's daughter as his wife.
I don't want my kids to smoke.
My car is older than I am.
I missed you, didn't I?
The modern man is no longer happy without a car.
Help is on the way.
Use this information well.
I saw something.
Can I make some suggestions?
Mary was looking for you then.
I found a place.
Tom, where are you going to make pictures?
I'll get you some nuts.
None of us are guilty.
It's not a whole story.
What are these good for?
His parents were outside the city.
And what can you teach me about this?
How long has Tamás been working here?
That's bullshit.
You're telling the truth.
Tommy knows a lot about Mari.
What's the 67th grade?
They're fired.
Those girls are very busy.
Are you sure it's okay?
Tom lied to the witness.
You're reading it.
We're happy.
Well, that doesn't mean it's smart, either.
Tom hasn't changed.
I tried to eat.
I can deal with kids.
He slept again.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
We've been dating each other.
They're stolen.
Tom knew about rape.
I sat down with him.
First of all, that's all.
The old man got hit by a car.
I'm gonna have to wash my hands.
Caligula was a Roman emperor who listened to the name Incitus, which means "good".
I should never have listened to you.
It's really sad.
We're sick.
They've got their eyes.
That was my father's wedding this year when I was born.
Let me rest a little.
I don't know much about dogs.
This lady looks very good.
The tour is my favorite meal.
Look at Tom.
He's got nothing to do with it.
What do you want to do with her?
Tommy deleted his Facebook page.
This ingredient contains a list of fats, oils, oils and sugars.
I don't like to work; what if we were to go to the movies?
You should watch the cake.
That's how you look.
I need to change.
It's a country that's popular in China.
I'm kidding.
Today, we want our children to make their own decisions, but we expect these decisions to be in our best interests.
I'm afraid of the ties.
I always knew this day would come.
I'm glad you liked it.
Mari's been with you.
Tom went to bed many years ago.
It's about half an hour.
It's a red dress.
It doesn't work.
Are you kidding me?
He hurt her.
Tom's just a kid.
There's too much to drink.
What color is your hair?
Who founded the Google Translator?
Mary asked Tom what his opinion was.
That's great.
I doubt you'll remember.
He's got the knife.
You've sworn six months.
Shall I take you somewhere?
Tom's sick.
Tom's birthday.
I killed him in a storm - it wasn't a matter of priority.
We need to count the voting schedules.
I don't like the spell.
Don't worry, it's not the end of the world.
You're gonna spend the rest of your life here in a moment.
Tom's a retired cop.
They don't know us.
One litre tea contains about three grams of grams of white.
Don't forget to write to us.
I underestimated Tom.
I don't know.
Life begins when you're ready to live it.
Tom works hard to support his family.
I hope my boss will understand my plan.
Can I show you?
All the money's gone.
How nice!
I need to talk to him.
He's dead.
Tom left Mary's name.
I did it like he didn't understand it.
Good humor helps in difficult situations.
You got it?
I'll see you later.
It'll be interesting.
I'm gone?
I have black hair.
It was a big day yesterday, but it's a lot better today.
We need to warn Tom.
Sometimes we'll meet next week.
Stop it.
What operating system are you using?
So, Tom's gone for the apartment?
The hotel's completely clean.
Has anyone stopped?
Tom's a good teacher.
All right, Tom!
Stop it!
Where's your confidence coming from?
Maria herself got her wedding dress.
Tom's a good boss?
He's got his stomach cut off.
Can you picture the scene?
Someone broke into my house last week.
How often do you lose things?
Do we have any papers?
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I'll explain later.
Hold always shows the same page to Earth.
Tommy hasn't gone out all week.
You should've come here earlier.
His words were exactly those.
He looks young.
Don't be too direct.
The dog's going to beat the aliens.
I'm sorry.
He knows the risks.
Zoknit's dead.
Tom hemophilia.
You never tell me you love me.
Please, there will be a little more careful in the future.
Isolation was stupid, Sami.
You don't have a lot of friends.
You're here for free?
Who hired Tommy?
Tom and Mary answered once.
Have you seen five?
There's an amazing witch, too.
I'm not here.
I can't follow your logic.
What would you like to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand the purpose.
No one was there.
All my questions have been answered.
I knew you'd be in trouble.
Tomina's here.
I feel a lot of pain in my life.
I'm gonna risk it.
How can you say that?
I don't want to sleep.
I don't believe a word from him.
My birthday is November.
Are you all right today?
You're stupid!
I worked hard a month ago.
Tom's been sleeping in two packs.
Here you go.
Is that a problem for you?
Why did you take this party?
Who wrote this?
He's gone!
I felt pretty lonely.
I'll go to my friend.
Leave the door open.
Time's gonna be fast enough if you read something.
Tom's thinking fast.
My dream is that I'll be an artist.
I lost my skin.
I like to sleep.
The fruit is in the basket.
I love the silent pizza.
We think our son's very smart, and of course he's not just that we're accepted.
We're stuck.
Mary said she wasn't Tom's daughter.
Did you eat in my restaurant where Tom works?
I hope he'll work.
I came here to take my dog.
Do you teach French in your schools?
You're poor.
You're going to get the hell out of here.
I got into you, Tom.
You're going to be late.
Where were you when I needed your help?
The coffee's ready.
You just like it because of my black hair?
I'm sure I've heard this voice somewhere.
The doctor suggested that she go to the hospital.
I'm regular.
I'm not well paid.
Why are you interrupting?
My family isn't too big.
Please step forward.
There are more cars on the road than I do.
I hope they're okay.
Tominas should have known this would happen.
Tommy's a little too heavy.
My sister, Tomit, she loves you.
It's late.
I'm a monster!
Tom's not crazy.
We have to pay the tax.
Tom's on his way to the ground.
They're not responding.
You kept doing what you did.
Take a few.
We'll settle down later.
I'm an Israeli.
They went into the forest.
How could you wait for me to pay for that?
Tom asked Mary where John is.
If it hadn't been on the map, I'd've lost it.
I think he's coming.
He's in the kitchen tomorrow.
Are you kidding me?
Can you tell me exactly what you really want?
My wife's gone.
We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem is.
What did they look at?
I'm not sure Tom knows where Mari is.
I'm asking three guards.
Tom's in a pizza.
I'll wait.
Tom can do it.
No one in this house.
What the angel does, no one can touch.
Give it to him!
You're not gonna die.
Did they shoot Tom?
My horse is white.
You got it.
We need to be comfortable.
Is the museum open today?
Tom's not because he's on the line.
The wifi doesn't work for me.
I'll be back in a minute.
Do you study English every day?
It's a lot of luck for the competition.
That won't be enough.
Looks like it.
I didn't sleep.
Tommy's request is at least twice mine.
No one can see my tears.
She was born in Mohamed Mekka.
Tom and Maria.
Tell me the words you don't understand.
Who's the tallest man you know?
I want you to be all right tomorrow at this time.
They ended up in the spring days, and they were replaced by the cold winter days.
Why me?
I've never thought of that before.
They didn't see anyone.
I'm the boss, aren't I?
My son came to my room.
Tommy doesn't seem happy to see us.
Soon after Tommy died, his wife returned home.
Tom's got a knife.
I didn't do what I had to do.
Do you have Tom's tattoo?
I'm not sorry to apologize.
Please stay where you are.
I don't travel much.
He remained in France for a while and then went to Italy.
He's always been busy.
There's a certain possibility that the thing will happen in my life.
She loved her job, too.
Did you find anything?
Keep your blood away from me.
Why didn't Tom send the bus?
It's possible to expand the suit.
Ten times a day.
It's very white.
They left last night.
We haven't even played in Boston yet.
Tom probably doesn't know why Mary's not here.
Don't worry.
Good people look good, regardless of what they're doing.
You're comparing your soul to a whole circle.
Tom's in the hospital now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't stand this noise.
I'm so glad we met.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Tommy's in trouble, but Mari's not.
We should probably go.
I love coffee.
You know who Tom is?
I'm willing to marry you.
We're understandable.
It'll be a new day tomorrow.
Hold us a show.
The world is in trouble.
Tom is losing.
They play baseball after school.
They've been taken by two.
You've done a perfect job.
He's stuck in the follicle.
Tommy wants some books.
This is where the day is.
What are they gonna do?
Tom took the attack.
Tom never eats a baby at all.
No, it's not my house.
I live in New York.
Our coffee's gone.
Let's go.
What would you do if you were your child like that?
My kids don't usually lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
This is never over.
They're both named.
I wish you wouldn't do that now.
I tried to help Tomina.
Your soul is hurt in hell.
I'm pregnant and my head hurts, I think I'm gonna get sick.
I'm starting to get in.
Put that down.
You've lost your love.
He's got a class.
That's where you can give me that kiss?
I think Twitter's just a waste of time.
Come on, listen to me.
Tom asked Mary the same question from me.
Hold no one.
We were born here in this world.
I helped Tomina regain her Christmas number.
I forgot to get a flower for Evá.
We didn't do it for Tommy.
He could've kissed the butt, but he didn't, he just missed it.
We're not so poor.
He's working for the pay, and not because he's interested.
I know who hurt him.
I'm dependent.
The glass of the tree has reached its mouth.
He's a good friend.
He made a scientific discovery.
Tom's computer contains hundreds of digital hermelin videos on the secret map.
Why are you so tired today?
I'm out of my restaurant.
How many people do you think we're gonna call at the pool?
Tominak doesn't have a lot of books.
I'm afraid it's gonna work.
Let's move!
There's no sport there like me.
From my phone.
Tom's back at the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What do you want me to do with Tommy?
I feel better every day.
I feel like I'm coming.
What do the doctors say?
I forgot the name of the leader.
Be nice, help!
He didn't say anything.
Why are you asking for forgiveness?
Tom wants them to get caught.
Did you know Tom left home?
I love you.
We're home today.
I saw Tom dance with another girl.
There was no one in the room.
Tom's girlfriend took pictures of her in the fire.
I'll go and tell everyone.
Go ahead.
You're an expert.
This reminds me of a girl I've ever met.
I was on the list.
Give me my book back!
Even if we've done everything we can, we know we won't win.
He was close to suicide.
That was my foot.
He didn't say that to my mother.
Tom didn't know his water heater was locked up until he got a big water bill.
This is our secret.
Why are you unsatisfied?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
There was a fire nearby last night.
It's better if we go, Tom.
It's probably a little sleep for all of you.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't be able to do this.
It's just a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
I went to the airport.
Are you home?
The tops are going around the mountain.
That's what I think.
How can I understand you?
It's in the kitchen.
I should've done it with you.
Maybe I don't want to eat the same thing again today.
I guess Tamás was right.
Here's my member card.
I'm the only one who found Tama to help.
Tom's out of the way.
One of my bikes is a defect.
I don't usually eat with Tamás.
It's over, right?
You've been drinking since two.
I'll keep it.
That statement has not been translated yet.
Tom's waiting too long.
It's very expensive.
Man's not from my grandmother, except for a few.
We're gonna be fine.
Tom wants to learn to smile.
I'm having a hard day today.
Here's your bag!
An intelligent man who discovered something more interesting than sex.
Tom's moss coming out.
He loved both of them, and they both loved him.
I can't stop calling him.
Try someone else.
Remember what you said.
Take off your hair!
He's just drinking pancakes.
I think I'm more interested in finding the room at the traditional sex.
That's incredible.
After waiting for the storm, he started to commit fraud.
I need your attention.
Tom and I know the truth.
It's a crime.
Tom's gonna grow up.
Do you have an email address?
You got caught, you're not ready.
Tommy knew where Maria got her car.
You should be on board now.
Tom and Mary are not living in the same state.
Look!
Don't save your cousin's ass in your father's house.
Sometimes I go to the movies.
She never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me!
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not gonna shoot Tom.
Tom's got a piece of shit out of his ass.
I didn't mean to tell you that.
I'm not going to Boston.
Tom had to go home earlier.
The prices are up.
Get out of the way.
I didn't buy the car.
How much is the bus going?
You're not doing anything!
It's hard for France to escape?
I see a house.
It's just that you know, it's a very bad joke.
He's been smoking with us.
Did you like the artist?
It's a very nice meal I've cooked in my pockets.
I used to sleep on the floor when I saw my grandmother and my grandfather.
We were there.
Tommy left the team after three games.
I'm kidding.
The circle that the painter brought to the table was still cheap.
If I'm big, I'd like to be a fireman.
A very dangerous sport where a little mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you cut off the baby's play.
Now it's up to them.
Take us to town.
He spent three months on the fountain.
Tom's in a hurry.
It's just that he started reading the book when someone knocked on the door.
I just went to work when the phone rang.
I feel helpless.
Inductive fireplaces use magic to direct the data and serenes.
Thank you for coming to me.
He's got everything they need.
He's always on my side.
No one likes a lot.
He's a decent man.
It's all right, it's over.
Police officers arrested the suspect.
I love things like that.
You're gonna let us go there or not.
Why did you become a right?
I'm back.
You shouldn't wait long.
Tom seems to enjoy the party.
Why don't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
How disgusting!
Tom put the boxes on the side.
It's connected that the bear loves the honey.
We're on the move.
Don't worry about getting married.
I'll see you soon.
Did you ask them to wait?
I'm tired, and I'm ready for school.
Where's the phone book?
I'm fine.
The cats are gonna be proud of you.
He dropped his car from the parking lot.
It's his Christmas gift.
You know what?
It's never too late to learn.
Look at the Google Translator.
You're my princess.
What a wonderful place!
We could do something for Tom.
I'll keep this in mind.
It was a big house.
We are happy to accept your offer.
I thought so.
It wasn't Tom.
Why don't we go out to have a party tonight?
Dreams have changed.
Don't be mad at yourself.
Tom told me he was home last night.
I didn't tell anyone you were here.
That's good news.
Does it matter?
Majuko designed his own clothes.
That's just what's happening in Australia.
The Turkish is a violent language.
I wanted to know the truth.
What kind of movies do you want to watch?
Tom's breathing.
Please fix this.
Tom lost his leg after he fell asleep.
Can I ask you a question?
Find out what I found.
I'm sick of cancer.
They were born in Florida.
Tom's too young, isn't he?
Tommy, can you hear me?
I couldn't get the record on my feet.
I just don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to go home.
It was like a father to me.
You're gonna hurt me.
Help's on the way.
Are they speaking French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Listen to me.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come on, how are you?
I'm counting on you to join us.
You've grown up.
I'm looking for my phone.
Listen to me.
No one can stop it anymore.
Who did you see?
I'll sleep here.
Tom threw Mary out of the house.
Mari was upset when Tommy took some of his breaks.
In Japan, a group of lakes, many mountains, and almost no forest.
We're eating fresh fish.
She put her blue paper on the table.
Two years older, but not as high as I am.
This meat is well past the table.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
I like to follow the tradition of making a walk by the table tonight.
What can we count on?
There's a stick in my leg.
The animals are afraid of fire.
It wasn't a week ago.
Don't go to school just because they're waiting for you.
And you're almost drunk.
It's gonna happen.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I gave Tom a key to my office.
There's got to be an interpreter.
You understand women's language.
I think Tom's still out of work.
I'm sorry.
I'm ready to help you at any time.
We're gonna get out of here.
The accumulators are gone.
He found a good seat for me.
We're all going to die before or after.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
You've got a problem with that?
Tom's on the stand.
Tommy couldn't replace his loneliness.
We tried to warn.
I found that their bullet was very complicated, contrary to the explosive, which is very simple.
You better watch out.
Tom loves the kids.
He's on the move today.
It's not that bad.
Tommy touched my hand.
Who brought this?
You've got the floor with the windshield.
These bananas don't eat.
Let's get out of here.
But I don't care.
I think you were right.
Where'd they keep the wedding?
I'll be in the stream.
It wasn't the first time they did it.
The water is cold.
It was a beautiful summer day.
Sometimes I feel crazy.
That's a good place.
Any questions?
That's ridiculous.
I'll be back all night. I'll be back in the morning.
When do they keep the choices?
Tom's supportive.
Tom sat in.
I was sitting in a chair at the office of freedom when I was attacked by a sudden thought: if a man is free, he doesn't feel his own weight.
Speak in the ears of everyone to hear you.
A new system is installed on the train.
We believe in God.
Your role is over.
Where are we going tonight?
He's dressed in a hairdresser.
We should've had three bottles of wine.
Can I borrow it?
I can't find Tim.
Stand by.
Thania's position is transferred.
I hope so.
That's not interesting.
You were always like that.
The day went down to the horizon, and it was buried.
Which fear has he won?
Tom's home.
Tom dropped a piece of meat and made it to his aunt.
I'll try again.
You never know what's going to happen.
If everything's going well, he graduated at the university in 2001.
The decision was postponed.
It's never happened to me like this.
Daninas has a three-hour flight.
He cut his face off with a toothbrush.
I don't understand what's so funny about this.
I'll kiss Tom.
Tom left it here.
I was the only one who survived.
He advised her to quit smoking, but she didn't listen to him.
Pack him up!
Tom's got the rest.
Are you hungry at all?
My watch is cheaper than yours.
I can't remember how Tommy looked.
Are you crazy, or what?
We'll appreciate his ability.
I feel better.
The director of the new film is an angel of a child.
He's in college.
They are responsible for Basic Freedoms for a little Amateur Security, and they are not valued by any of them.
She's brave.
He looked at his face.
Why don't you come with us?
Tom saw someone.
He's a real bastard!
I love math.
You made a mistake.
Dani, I'm gonna take care of her.
But it's not bad for you.
If I were in your place, I'd ask him.
Do you know this man?
I have to work tonight.
What do you think he was watching TV in this room last night?
Tom wanted to keep the stolen money for you.
I got a half-grapefruit in the morning.
I don't think there's a god.
Tom doesn't know who to believe: John or Mary.
Ageing doesn't mean you can't use your imagination anymore.
It was a nightmare last night.
If I had money, I'd go around the world.
The political situation has changed.
You can go first.
Tom went into reading, and he wanted to go play.
I don't know what Tomina's car is.
There's dinner today.
I should've stayed with her.
Do you have feelings for Tom?
I hate that movie.
It was yesterday.
I'll take my shoes.
Where'd you get your bag?
It's just disgusting.
The next town is in the back of the dome.
What are you reading?
There are jeans and paints that take security guards away from them.
Let's go to the movie now?
I know you can do this.
I didn't know that for Tom.
These were his last words.
Tom loves sports and baseball.
I was very angry.
I've been upset for the first time.
I'd better have done it if I had more time.
Why didn't you mention there was a witness?
You can go when it's time for you.
Look forward, please.
Get this bag yourself!
Africa is mankind's expert.
I'm glad Tommy's leaving.
Did you talk to Tomina about this?
It's probably between us.
Do you have a volunteer?
Tom still gets his mother's clothes.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I knew Tom knew something.
Tom seems to have been nervous.
It's over for the October.
Maybe he's still waiting for the situation.
Welcome to Boston.
I've always been prepared.
Tom was at the end of the table.
Tom was nice, but Mary wasn't.
You're better than you are.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
If you don't behave well, it won't be Mikulas.
You're too young to buy cigarettes.
It was a mistake to kiss Tom.
Tom doesn't seem to be tired.
It's almost as big as you.
Do you accept some advice?
Oh, that's why.
Zagrab is the capital of Croatia.
That's inevitable.
I don't think it's important to deal with this guy.
You two talked to me.
Pocks!
Tom needs to take better care of himself.
Why don't you take your pants off?
Excuse me?
Tom says the air is overrun.
I know the secret.
The fire burned down the apartment.
Who's gonna do it?
Tom should've done that sooner.
She's staying at a hotel.
I prayed for the art.
Maradok, if possible.
He told us a story about a boy, Tom Sawyer.
Tom can do it.
Anyone who doesn't drink in a company, that's a towel or a spinon.
That's bullshit.
This moment should never end.
Last night, they were put in a state-of-the-art license.
- Can I take a look at your dress?
Please give her the best compliments.
Tom couldn't open the door.
Say that to the Hungarian!
Only access to the staff.
Tomina's been able to get some water.
Where can we meet?
There's no right answer.
In the early decades, only rich families had their children's spirals.
The crystalist water was very warm.
There's no other entertainment left.
We have an acceptable solution.
The new school was designed to take into account the special needs of young people.
Lapozz, please.
Everything that happened between us was a lie?
It's a picture.
It's close enough.
It's like Brigade!
I'm glad you're here, Tom.
That's what Tommy tells me.
It's Tommy's sister, like his wife, but it's a kiss.
We have to be Prudens.
He left without a word.
I never said that!
I don't care.
I'm so old, too.
I'll be there for the sugar.
I've cut the trigger.
I found Tom there.
Mr. Jones was late because I had a little rest in the hour.
Henry wants to see you.
Can you eat?
I've got a meeting today.
We're not leaving.
Tom didn't try to impress the truth.
I was happy last night.
Can I ask you your name?
Every stop is false.
It's mine.
I'm sorry, but it was a big deal.
Tom should've listened to Mari.
Tom apologized to Mary for the inconvenience she caused.
I'll apologize later.
I realized he was wearing a new hat.
Hold on, please.
He left without a apology.
I need to see it.
Don't let me.
It would be nice to have a little coffee.
There's a lot of flowers in the garden.
Tom called it too loud.
The answer was simple.
He shouldn't have come this early.
You always ask your opinion.
Let's do something else.
The collective responsibility means liability.
They need to study the subject so they can teach.
I know who's in this house.
Who's going to drive?
I've been hiding behind the street.
Tom's got the gays on his feet.
I'll talk to Tom in French.
Where are you?
It's okay.
Tom trusted his doctors.
They're not gonna get caught up in this.
Tom's gonna win a race.
You know, you can't stand on your feet for a minute, you know?
Nakamatsu was very upset when he asked his own dog.
You can go as well.
I'm glad Tom was able to change his name.
I know it's weird.
I sat on the ground.
He didn't just betray me, but to my dog.
Tom's in trouble.
I'm really sorry.
It's a public beach.
Go and get Tom some food.
That's just what Tommy means.
It's very weird.
Do you have any medicine?
It's a terrible word.
When I give you instructions, start the machine!
Many parents think there's too much power on TV.
I've got my own mind!
Work.
You're like me.
That's so funny.
Can I play my room?
Every god can, but there are only one.
That's very, very good.
It's not a decision yet.
How much were we doing?
Get your ass out of the way.
The door's not closed.
It's Tony's book.
They're here in time.
He was not careful.
You know I can do it.
That's not enough.
He's on his cell phone and he's noticed you've got three of them already.
Tom was home when it happened.
I'm gonna have a little sleep.
I've got a good shot.
The winner of the scientific prize decided to offer the money to charity.
I didn't hit him.
His name is Tom, and not John.
I'm not going to school tonight.
I'll be back in the next month.
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
This book is amazing.
Do you remember who I am?
Let's all dance!
He's just a man.
Can I help you, sir?
I want to know why women live more than men.
I can't stay in this house.
I'm paying well.
They're both in the yard.
I threw my bags off my room with the guards.
Is he alive, or is he dead?
He could be the man I need.
I hate to say that, but Tom and Mary are right.
My pulse's out of control.
Tom was really sick.
When we got married, my parents gave me this house.
He's never lost hope.
My villa's broken into a house.
Every morning he's sneezing himself.
Put your fingers up.
I'd like to say thank you for everything you've done for me.
Tom suggested I don't do it.
I'm not happy at all.
Sorry about last night.
It's time for us to say goodbye.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
It happened to me several times.
The trees are broken.
Tom asked Mary to come in.
It's working perfectly on the iPhone.
Maybe it's a trap.
Remember him coming home early.
Tom's gone to bed.
We've only got enough lives for three days and we've got water.
You have a good memory.
Why are you buying?
Ten months after he left, he went home.
Tom came too late.
Tom's out.
Your words are the only ones that should be translated on this website.
What am I supposed to do?
I think he's gone.
Let's have a little bit of fun.
It's a shame to run, but it's useful.
You're going to get the heat.
I don't.
I've been betrayed.
That's unusual.
In capitalism, there's no smoking to buy.
You've been surprised by the horror of the storm.
I don't care what's going to happen.
I don't like to argue.
It's too small for you.
Tom gave Mary everything.
Go on, try it.
Take a shower!
Muriel is 20 years old now.
- A drink?
He's refurbished the ceiling, and now it's like a house.
I'll read a letter.
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
I used to sleep in the open window.
He's got a news.
If you live in a foreign country, you need a car.
I love you so much.
I want to help her, but I don't know how.
You're crazy.
My pain is due to the limit.
Tommy brought a fruit to Marina.
This doesn't happen to me first.
Don't fight!
I know you're in trouble.
It could be a long time.
Good morning, Mike.
I'm coming.
I don't know the name.
Which of the ten favorite movies?
I'd like some stuff.
The paper took his thoughts.
John wants to hang out.
Dear Maria.
Please fix it.
Where's Mom?
Tommy's never seen Mari in such a rage before.
You're under a curse.
This computer is the most expensive.
I'm armed.
The son of the repurchasing boy rejected his name.
I wish I had studied harder in my early teens.
This means the right price.
I need paper and toll.
I hate to go through.
Tommy's weird.
Why do you want to be angry?
Don't compare yourself to others.
Your meal's in the south.
We're classed.
Are you still here on this afternoon?
At least they're watching me.
Tom's a little nervous.
Do you have a lover?
My son has become a man.
Everyone is at risk.
Did they get this in the middle of it?
The protection program can't be counted very well.
That's all mine.
Tom was pregnant.
Can I pay for MasterCard's card?
Who can do this?
Don't be rude.
When you wake up tomorrow morning, you'll find something wonderful.
When's he coming?
I don't think I'll ever make Korean food.
Scientists have identified the entire genetic structure of the genome.
I don't know what you heard about it.
He likes the threat.
You're careful.
Tom's gonna sit down.
The waves were stopped because of the strong waves.
Tom went to work to get news.
I'm busy.
Tom's very strong.
No one called.
The world is a great place.
Look again.
I have nothing to do with it.
You treated like a child.
Oil and water don't break.
I'll tell you what's going on.
He's got some land on him.
We're still trying to figure out how he got away.
You'd do better if you weren't too much.
Tommy keeps his word.
You'll get it.
Please do everything you think you need.
I'd like to take a girl like that.
They look at the ground.
Tom's done a good job.
I'm in a hurry.
Tom always does that.
She showed him my picture.
It won't work for me.
Don't open it!
- What are you doing tonight?
You got it now.
Pull up the darker, let's get some light.
I'll never love you.
Tom was talking.
There's a lot of mistakes, but I love her more than I love her.
What's my count?
Tom's probably gonna be happy.
It's surrounded by two green hills.
Did you think about that?
I've been hurt.
I should've been there at the meeting.
Too sweet.
We're on our way.
I'm not dead.
You know I'm late for the exam tomorrow.
We know this guy.
Tom's serious.
I can win if I'm lucky.
This is communism.
Come on, let's talk about the flowers.
I'm sorry when you heard the story.
Some words are too hard for me.
Do it today, don't wait for tomorrow.
It's hard for everyone to do the same.
He's under influence.
Our departure tomorrow depends on the timing.
I'm pregnant.
There's no such example.
Maybe they're gonna make a mistake.
He's probably not here.
That's what I went through with.
Let's not talk about it.
I'll stay home tomorrow.
Tom found a wounded dog.
What's my home account?
This is a hard part.
Whatever you do, don't tell Tamás.
I'm glad you're here.
Those shoes are too small for you.
He gave the police another personal description of the same thing he saw.
There's the bus!
They didn't find DNA as evidence.
Tom's in trouble when he buys it.
Do you know a good farmer?
Don't come in!
You're very round.
Tomina's not a force for parlor parking.
The good times are over.
The dinner was nice!
Just like you don't know.
You must be right.
I need a few hours to sleep.
What's wrong with you?
It's a heart attack.
She's taking care of her baby until her mother's gone.
I came to talk to Tommy.
Why did you do that?
I'm going to make coffee in the coffee shop.
You asked for my visa.
Tom's serious.
You're different.
He likes music very much.
Tom and Marika felt good about you.
It's a dictionary.
It's a real beauty.
Oh, my God, Mary, are you okay?
I know what you're not allowed to do.
This place is bad.
I can't believe this anymore.
Time's going very fast.
Call Tominak!
Another thing to learn and teach a language.
You've got to get the drink down.
That was Tom, wasn't it?
Tom's made it.
One hour later, the train was even higher.
What did you want?
I was in the bus.
With the exception of your leave, I'll eat everything.
Don't worry about us.
I need a pen.
One dog is still alive.
I can stand against everything, just not the test.
Shut the door in the closet.
I need money.
That's pretty serious.
We're stuck.
Tom's got a little red.
Here's an example.
Thank you for asking this question.
The door's been shut.
I did this for my health.
It's a kitchen.
How do we know the light is faster than the sound?
Tommy turned his back on the French flag.
I want to win that game.
He lived there for about five years.
It's been 30 years, but it's still his parents' age.
I've been married for two years.
He was in trouble because of his health problems.
Within a year, my son became stronger.
How beautiful!
I think I forgot at home.
I promised my parents I wouldn't drink.
Tom said he's giving up his Chinese dress.
We're very similar.
That was Chinese to me.
Oh, my God!
I've won a lot on my car sales.
I see you've done this before.
Don't lose your patience.
The solution was there in front of my eyes, I haven't noticed.
One more time, one more time.
That's very good.
We haven't met anywhere yet?
Tom's talking to a little French.
Tommy's the best player on our team.
It's actually worse.
We can't wait anymore.
Are there Paris?
Let's celebrate your performance.
Of course, Tom's praying to his children.
I can't take care of the stress.
We can't agree with you on this.
I'm sure she's taking care of Maria now.
Tommy doesn't know how to handle the bugs.
Mary's birthday was so nice that Tom took it twice.
There are Christian Arabs, too.
I told you you'd like Tommy.
I'll be better by the next day.
It's dangerous.
If there's too much work, it's bad, but too much freedom.
Tom's gonna quit.
A beautiful six-eyed guy just got on the roof.
It was really fast.
I assured Tom I'd do it.
Of course.
Can I borrow three dollars?
I didn't get it.
It's good to take this substance.
I went to Rome.
Come on?
He grew up in Tom Boston?
Get out of here!
It's my feeling that this page is a long romantic novelty with the principals, Tommy and Mari.
I have to follow you.
I bought my house for two years.
Take it and put it in the fire.
Come on, meet me.
Do you mind if I take it?
The bad time kept them back from the vortex.
I'm gonna get some milk and vegetables.
Maria and Elke are not brothers.
I love the door.
You can't vote unless you're ten or older.
Tom's having a good time.
I haven't eaten meat before.
You show me the book?
We hope that this project will be implemented immediately.
It's possible.
Do you know where Toledo is in Spain?
We'll work in Boston next year.
It's not my keys.
You're my life, my great love.
Do you really think I can help you?
What if we get in?
Do you read the Bible?
He's got another tattoo.
I can assure you, we're not gonna make this mistake again.
It's May 15. It's your birthday.
It's a living animal in you.
A meal shouldn't look like that.
Tommy's collecting the meteorites.
Tom ruled the car with his land.
What are you doing?
Can't you do anything to stop?
Can you stand at home on the floor?
First of all, don't forget to write to me.
I recognized her face.
Whatever happens, just smile.
I got ready for the meeting.
Why don't I sit down?
He's in school.
Watch out!
He'll take your help.
Wait!
Don't get your word!
They need you.
And he shut the door before Maria.
How long do I take this?
The teacher's diet ranges from 11 to 1.
Three months ago, they were married.
I got your food.
How many pills do you have on a macaw?
I think it's very difficult for the explosive.
It contains water.
Close that door.
I don't wear clothes.
I don't care about it anymore.
Tom's alive.
Tom went into his bag and pulled out a package card.
Am I right?
Tom and Mari were going to a picnic party to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
Maybe Tamás is working long.
Contact the air conditioner!
What's your mother's name?
One day he's alive to another, he doesn't have to save a bullet.
Is your watch okay?
He died because of his incompetence.
Tom, where are we?
I don't know what to do with the grown-up.
Oh, thank you.
I like this book at least.
Where are you now?
He's heartbroken.
Please don't lie to me.
Tomi dance.
Tom can sit here if he wants.
He wasn't so excited at that time.
Do you have enough cassettes?
The boxzo Olympics take a very expensive jeans. They go to the Olympics, put their jeans in the dress bar, and add an inscription: If you take the jeans, I will kill them. The Olympics will go back in an hour and see that their jeans have disappeared, only one pellets in the place: You must first get them. Olympic football.
Tom, you're a great dancer.
I'll call you back.
The situation has improved.
The water's on the ground.
It's actually working.
Please change the interface.
Now listen to him!
I should have said I didn't feel it.
Why do you want to join the army, Tamás?
He's happy with his new car.
The coffee maker's on the ground, with two more senses.
I was born a farm.
I got a car.
No one's gonna die.
The last day of the week is Thursday.
Thank you for all the compliments.
Just call Tominak.
I'll be back soon.
I've made a playbook for Maria.
You wouldn't be working.
Tom's not the only one.
It was Japan's former capital.
Tommy's very nice to me, but Samin's got a lot more money.
Tom's been drinking too much.
He's holding the dog.
Tommy did it like he didn't know anything about it.
No one's going to be unsatisfied.
Tom hit the button and waited.
I don't know why this hasn't happened before.
The heat is great tonight.
He had a greater responsibility with his new position.
Why are you so determined?
I wish I could raise my wife.
I'll write it down!
Tom's real.
When will this end?
You met my sister, didn't you?
Tom's gonna choose.
He wants to be like me.
Tom was young and influential.
I'm asking for a martini.
He still loves me, and I think I still love him.
It was a strange dream last night.
I didn't think so.
I fixed the car last night.
Get off my car.
What's wrong with me?
The fear was totally unfounded.
My country is the whole world.
It's a kind of energy.
The worst came in.
The building was soon started.
This will threaten the welfare of the city.
The propaganda is communication is the campaign they want to win.
I haven't tried yet.
We'll meet you wherever you want.
Mary is such a nice girl that everyone loves her.
Has anything changed since?
I'm tired of everything.
The accident has caused hundreds of injuries.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
She's not a witch anymore.
Your hair's starting to get out.
I got it!
The court said the accused was innocent.
We won't win.
Very intelligent.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well,
I'm in the basement.
Tom's an invited guest.
Mary died in her birth.
That's exactly what they want.
It's probably convincing.
I know Alig.
You have to go to the doctor.
I can't wait anymore.
Japan is surrounded by a coastal coastal country.
After my first catering training, I felt all my pain as if I were rocking myself.
Let's keep learning.
You're gonna take Tom out.
It's my skin.
Sit down.
Who's going to the husband?
Who?
I lost my sister-in-law.
I'm talking to an expert like my mother tongue.
Put them on the table.
Is it true that you like coffee?
I'm sorry.
Just do it.
I improvised.
Help yourself, and God will help you.
Maybe there's another reason.
He's buying cars.
You're good at lying, aren't you?
It's not a funeral.
I'm going home now.
I was born on a ship.
Red isn't your color.
They're here separately.
I'm not scared.
According to our knowledge of language, it's a human invention.
We've got enough heads to build another hole.
You can go home if you like.
Everyone is equal to God.
They said it was a crime.
It's both eyes.
Is there a Youtube?
Where's the problem?
They can go wherever they want.
Magdalena, my oldest daughter is like an angel.
I don't think things change.
Tom will never know what happened.
I'm gonna go get Tom.
She's staying in the house.
I should've done this somewhere else.
Tom's a scientist.
Tom was one of the many who opposed the proposal.
I've got a lot of time.
I don't speak French.
Her parents are older than my parents.
Sami and Layla haven't lived together for six years.
I opened the gate.
What's your name?
No one hurt her.
Take my car.
You don't have to get the kid out of the bathroom.
What a day!
You waited for Tom, didn't you?
Then no one saw him.
Neither do I.

I've read this book before.
It's with the love I feel about you.
It's crazy.
My mom never used to eat before.
How old is the boss's neck?
Wait in the car.
That's it.
Bill and John wanted to get together once a month for a conversation.
I agree with Tom.
Are you with us, Tom?
You want to know what we lost together?
Let's get to the point.
I want to know who's coming with us.
You don't have to do it for everyone.
Imports are subject to high taxes.
He's counting the first pressures.
Are you going home?
Tom would have told us if he knew.
Look at the next page.
They're just like me and my friends.
We've known him for years.
The appreciation is being paid away for a long time.
I can't translate this book.
You're going to think of Shakespeare.
You won't believe what happened after this.
I'm a teacher of the tennis club.
At least let us talk about it.
That's bad.
Get your hands off me!
We have to be there.
What's the video?
This is my dog.
Let's hope it works.
Choose, or I've got it.
Where did he get it?
Maria's my oldest daughter.
Tom kept his story going.
It's a lot more complicated than I do.
I'm so sorry to have lost hope.
I thought you'd get Tom in.
I know you were kidding.
God help me, I killed a waiting mother.
Now you don't need money.
Why is it dangerous?
I'm not hungry.
Have you been on TV yet?
Look at my eyes.
The society is divided.
Learning indigenous languages is useful for everyone.
Tom should have been a sceptic.
Tom immediately noticed that someone didn't care about him.
He was afraid of Maria too.
That's a great part.
This is ours.
Tom didn't do anything else, he just complained.
I took a picture.
Tom has no real friends.
He's got another thing to do.
It never existed.
Are you happy?
It's never too late for you to be what you could have been.
Tom asked me to help Mary.
We've had too much food.
I don't think he's married.
How many sessions do I have one day?
I think you're wrong.
They're going up to the stage.
Okay, but what about the money?
Would you like to answer me?
He moved to Paris in 1966.
Why do people cut their hair?
I heard you take a walk.
What do you think he's lying about?
Tommy lived in a dream world, and as he was used to, he was just the body while his mind was completely different.
Tom did what Mary wanted.
Idaharatom?
Which color do you prefer?
Where's the man now?
I really love your website.
After the truth, the salt is coming.
I didn't get anything.
Don't you think about it?
Where did I put the earphone?
I don't have enough money to travel.
Please make sure that my room gets excited while I'm out.
Did you talk to your wife?
You're hungry.
I just don't know how to stop it.
Didn't you want to show me something?
He started looking for the missing child.
We all know why.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I learned a lot about his books.
I'm in favour of the pirates.
Why didn't you tell me about it earlier?
The body is lifeless.
Tom told everyone he was dreaming.
It's a circus.
Tom was released in 2013.
It's okay.
I saw a UFO.
I don't like kids.
Who can you be?
I really like being alone.
It wasn't fun.
He'll love us when we get home.
I was surprised when I found out that Tom was a Frenchman before.
That would be logical.
We're gonna have to re-shape the chair.
It doesn't contain the element.
I'm competitive.
He speaks English and German.
It's time for you to get ahead of yourself.
No one's ever thought of giving him a ticket before.
That's disgusting.
Tom wears his clothes.
What a pain!
How would you like them?
I'm sorry, but I can't agree with you.
I grew up in Boston.
Bacteria are everywhere.
Chris didn't have a car.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
I like to trust you.
I'm sure he's rich if he keeps three cars.
Tom's gonna be a hero.
I only knew the real purpose when I met him.
What's the strongest say in the world?
Everyone's still there.
Can you explain what PKO means?
We're not afraid.
How old are you?
With a fire-fired fire and lightning, it broke through the light bulb.
I've had a meal.
I'm really sorry I hurt you.
Shall we go?
I'm on my way.
On the basis of a specific directive, we have chosen colors.
What did you and Tom do?
It's a dream.
This multimillionaire has five homes in four countries.
That's the best.
He's not here right now.
Don't be such a fool.
Go home.
I don't want anyone to die.
He answered that he didn't know anything about it.
Can I go get some clothes?
Did they hurt you?
I'll make Tommy happy.
I should've been much more precise.
And how do you know?
I want to see it.
Tom knows.
Are you really close to Sicilia Máltá?
Tom is too old for me.
It's not wrong to be black.
I grew up, but I'm not afraid of the dark.
The ice's alive.
There was Tamás and Maria.
It's a shame they get the same pay for the same job.
After the case, our relationship went through a sudden change.
I saved her night.
Tom says he never liked Chinese bread.
He's also working in a test room.
Jim was found guilty of the investigation.
What's wrong with your dog?
Tom was home all weekend.
I think I should have helped Tom.
We're not gonna let Tommy do that.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
Looks like I don't need you here.
I'd love to eat something.
Thank you for not saying, "I told you."
She's all back to normal surgery.
How'd you get this good shot?
You're crazy!
I have to leave early.
The decision has not yet been made.
They gave it to him in the afternoon.
Never underestimate a woman's feelings.
Libasult's with the burgon.
We'll hear a little Mozart.
He was hit in the middle of an intrusion.
Are we all ready?
That's a lot of money.
He likes ancient things.
Tell me what you mean.
I'll get in.
Tom's useless.
I just want to do something.
There's another man in his life.
Do you speak Chinese well?
I'll be there tonight.
When we got back, there were only eight teams left.
What's UFO?
I lived there for five years.
I'll give this to Tom.
You just need me.
Why should that interest us?
Any doubts?
It was my favorite sport at high school.
The angels greatly appreciate freedom.
You're really good at it.
I know Tom's happy.
Let's not forget the main purpose of the argument.
Don't give up on your man!
The first God of Canada was written in French.
Leave the dog out.
I'm going to blow up.
Who's the man?
The robots are definitely contributing to the world.
We need to find a way to stop Tom.
No one's taking me anywhere.
It's written on the table, "Third smoking."
I saw Tamá today.
What a unique country!
Your friends are waiting for you.
Of course.
When he got out of the tunnel, he had only one piece of shit on him.
These pictures are bad memories.
Are you happy?
What the hell's wrong with you people?

I knew what it was.
The oranges are bigger than the mandarin.
Tom took a white box.
Tom was wearing a black hat.
Come again when you want.
I've heard a little about myself.
I'm ready in a few minutes.
Sit where I can see you.
Please understand my strange thoughts.
I'll be ready.
I did it without you.
I'm sorry, but I think you're sorry.
I love city life very much.
Tom's taking care of his own business.
They don't want to look at others.
It's the same for everyone.
I'm not stupid.
Some people have been upset in my situation.
You forgot your wedding anniversary.
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
Adjust your clock.
We're looking for oil.
One more time.
Be careful, this can be a trap.
I can't stay away from my wife for so long.
There is still no clear definition of what the country is.
It's a big world.
"What happened?" "The car was broken."
Don't spend money that he hasn't even bought.
It's a little early for the theory, isn't it?
They're all screaming.
How much is the cheese going on?
They've been charged with murder.
He took his hand off.
He's always name-and-moving.
You, me and him there, Joseph, we set up a team.
He told me he'd be gone soon.
My mom lived with us.
People don't like what they don't understand.
You're a very special man to me.
Finish the letter.
I'm Ricardo.
Where are we going?
The news says he's committed suicide.
Shut up, or we're ready.
Are you selling your personal computer in this business?
Did you eat?
Where's love?
Don't worry, I'll see you.
There's still a fish-guarantee that maybe everything's gonna be all right.

Tom has to go to school.
My neck hurts a little.
I won't let Tom Boston go.
They've crossed the Earth.
It's coming by sea.
No one can stop it.
I know who she is.
I should have admitted to do that.
Tom's gonna be very angry.
Why are you doing this now?
Go in and do what they say to you.
What a wonderful presentation!
I can't drive a car.
Tommy wanted everyone to be happy.
Get down with the corrupt politicians!
Tommy came out of the company in 2013.
Tom and Mary were both at home.
You're talking about this dog.
I want to get a bottle of bread.
He sent me a load.
He's a coward.
Tom doesn't have much time to get out.
Tom wants to try.
Tell me where the previous night was at the time of the murder.
Stop it, I can't!
Ten, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen.
We're in half an hour after night.
You have an hour.
I grew up with my fear.
Why did you take this bike?
Keep him seated, please.
It's a black hole.
Do you have enough money?
Let's start at the end of the week.
The teacher arrested him after school.
I like the angle.
Where were you all?
Which one of you prefers better?
Tom soon found out Mary stole all her money.
I'll never do it without your help.
Tom agreed to go to Boston.
He gave you a book.
I've got an old bunker.
I'm gonna have to go.
Nice narrator!
I didn't like to golf Tomina.
It's a small chance you're getting to the point.
They weren't there.
Tom's done well.
I'm tired enough.
I don't remember ever getting away from work, even though nothing goes away.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
We compared Tom's and Mary's work.
This is a new model.
No one left with Tom.
I didn't die.
You know who said that?
We've got it.
He wants to see you tomorrow.
I'm going to ask you to punish me.
It wasn't long before John was attacked by an idea.
I'm sick.
Is everybody okay?
I'll keep him for my best friend.
Give me a day.
Happiness is on my side today.
Please tell me your name.
Do you think Tom did it?
I don't want to go with you.
Who's your cousin?
The base was very sculpting.
Do you know how to play it?
I'm trying to get some help.
Can you get us to the British Museum?
It was weird.
It's really a big number.
I want to be rich.
The kids are praying in the homies.
I'm here to visit Tommy.
What are you doing to get out of here?
Tom heard the car's coming back.
You've been there before.
Do you know your family?
Some of them are on the way out.
Tom's done it all right again.
Don't you think they're still hands?
Do you still want me?
We can't wait two weeks.
Let's go see you.
I called my daughter Nairu and wanted her a long life.
How did you know Tom was going to Boston?
Tom never asked why.
Don't talk to him while he's driving.
This is the best time to stay here and not go anywhere.
Five miles away.
Tommy tried to replace his loneliness.
I don't think Tommy was able to do this on his own.
I can't stand the weekend.
Tom's been kidding the kids.
There's a hole in it.
Can I help you?
I don't have much time.
I'm a soldier.
I've read it more.
He knows Mr. Davidson well.

They do everything for each other.
More and more efforts are being made to use the media interactive nature.
I know where you live.
Tommy's going.
My dad doesn't drink alcohol.
I must have lost my key on the road.
She's always gone crazy seven hours ago.
Tom's ready to talk.
We're missing.
Do you think I'm going anywhere?
They're looking for me.
We'll lose everything.
It's not likely they're getting married.
Give me the sugar, please.
What's Tom reading?
She also borrowed Maria's camera.
That's exactly what I thought.
I'm drinking tea too.
Tom has two smaller games than Mari.
Put the gun down!
Let's go to the movie.
It's an air conditioner.
I know you love coffee.
Turn this text down.
I have to let you go.
Tom doesn't eat too much Italian food.
Tom used to eat a meal before dinner.
Tommy took Mari's leg off.
It takes about a minute to get there.
They treat me like a child.
How much are you hungry?
No one lives in this house.
You're not allowed to enter this area.
Tom should never have returned.
It doesn't have to be arranged.
Yes, the lady is our manager.
I'm not very hungry right now.
That's better.
He missed school because of his illness.
The roses aren't as beautiful as these.
She decided to drive a red car.
Use your own money.
No one knows their name.
We're sure we don't.
You're out of your mind.
Who noticed that?
I didn't steal it.
I'm sure Tom's found guilty.
Where are you, Karen?
You say it's my fault?
Tom should've done that right now.
It's just a word.
Her grandfather's name is on it.
It could be a problem.
Who's got the key?
I hate when Tom does this.
I'd just start writing a letter when I came home.
Tom was nice.
The same old problem.
Tom was arrested.
That's right, Tom.
Get out of the pit!

Good education can't be measured in money.
He decided, the man was singing.
That's so nice.
Tom wasn't there last night.
It's a typical summer time.
Where do I find the information?
We went to the forest.
My dad wouldn't be right.
It's not too funny to be a cop.
If you were looking for my little baby in the world, you wouldn't find it.
Is the time running out?
I'll go to church every Sunday.
Eight o'clock in the morning.
The cat is like a man.
Who taught you how to beat you?
Tom's gone.
Tommy Marin called it.
Please don't mention this to anyone.
If you ask me, I'm happy.
Who's this young man?
We needed a compromise.
We've been friends with Sheila for a long time.
It's just between us, it's the round table diet.
Shit!
I want you to get me into the box.
There's a hell of a hell of a thing.
I want a good way.
I heard a gunfight.
I'm gonna have to get to that.
It's a fun day.
They'll be gone.
I should never have trusted you.
We're always going to church.
It's a beautiful color.
Sit down, Tommy!
We'll eat here.
He'll find out about that.
Tom's got a chance.
This will change your life.
I'm gonna blow my eyes off the hat.
You always give it to me!
I knew you were on your way.
Tom told me he knew where Mari lived.

I've brought a refund.
He was the last person I expected to see during my American stay.
That's what we've been up to.
I feel like it's time to have a baby.
It's not a good idea.
They're both in the room.

My mother was sitting in the kitchen.
Would you like to go to the movies with me?
Can I open the windows?
And who are you?
How do you like Japan's weather?
He doesn't know anything about Tom Boston.

You're not dead.
Shut up!
I want to give you 15 pounds of it.

Let's do something.
What a beautiful day!

Thank you for coming.
I'll be there before you.
They killed my apartment.
Let's have a good time.
You're an asshole.
You're on your own.
The police continued the investigation.
We lost, but we felt good about ourselves.
I'm not used to doing this kind of work.

Tom was a sceptic.
You're so smart!
I want to live in a big city.
Which one of these is Tom's birthday?
I need someone.
Who did you find?
It's very scary.
Tom took a few blacks towels.
He's trying to get away with it.

I saw it.
Kelly left the tower and went home.
I told Tom where I got my bike.

Tom is a very serious boy.
The moss looked like a moose.
I want to live forever.

We have time.
What direction does the beach have?
You're my best friend.

Right?

Tom says thank you every day.
You show me the way.

Come on, let's go!

The price is very high.
I asked the teacher to be quieter, but as if I were talking to the side, nothing happened.

You're doing a lot better than she is.
Tom's probably gonna be busy.
I have to go back.
That wasn't a difficult decision.
It has one condition: treatment does not always work.
I need to talk to you.
My dad has a lot of things.
What did you eat today?
I don't even know who she is.
The sea has taken heavy loads.
He's my dad.

How did you get into it?
I'm making some pictures of the sound.

What's that good for?
A little nice.

Oh, my God, it's Tom!
It's just how much it's going on.

How could this be achieved?
He's just writing a long letter.
I stopped talking.
I slept with an hour after midnight last night.
I woke up.
The explanation went beyond my imagination.
Tom sugar beet.
Of course Tom wasn't there.
But no one believed me.
He's been waiting for two hours.
They already know about it.
That's enough.
We're counting on it.
I'm sorry, I forgot to do my homework.
Tom was there this morning.
Are you gonna help us now?
I didn't just keep my promise.
Three nice souls selected.
What a shame!
Why don't you answer your father?
The flowers are dead.
I'm reading a book at home.
Do you have a motorbike?
You look different now.
In the morning a great deal of money, they'll live.
Who found the eye?
Wait a minute.
You can sit down if you want.
I'm clean.
It'd be better if you didn't do it until Tom's here.
What happens after we die?
Tom spoke rarely.
It was just too easy.
What he said was true.
Where'd it go?
Thank you for coming over.
I didn't even talk about Tom.
Before you get married, love will come from you.
The music stopped immediately.
Why do they like strong coffee?

There's a hair in my air.
That's why we have to accept it.
I'm not really satisfied with what I did.
We asked for everything.
I want to be a soldier.
I'm doing it like I didn't hear it.
I didn't hit you!
This can be serious.
Is this a sale?
It's also our best pilot.
The husband and the wife are doing it.
I had to give Tom some money.
Mary gargargar.
I feel safe with him.
You know how to pay attention to his audience.
I'll see.

Give me the next one.

I'm taking books.
There's a lot of people trying to get home.
Not one of the flowers was made from the machine.
I'll do everything I can to make sure I don't interrupt your teaching.
We have to go.
They're counting on you to win.
Tommy did what he wanted.
I just want to get out of here.
You didn't get my letter?
It's more debt than you can pay.
Tom broke his spell.
It was an experience to talk to him at the party.

She hates this.
I'm a little tired.
They'll be fine.

Go back to sleep!
I'm crying.
That's weird.
Come here six hours, but not earlier.

My brother is superior to me.
After the party, they'd become undeterred.
It's just a crazy bastard who doesn't have any fear.
You didn't feel enough in a green bathroom to get up.
He's interested in Tom.
Let them do their work.
That would be dangerous.
I'm sure I should know.
What did the printer want to say about this?
You have to get a bigger size next.
Tom picked up the bag and threw it away.
Tom was a bad guy.
Is it true you woke up to look at Tommy?
The soldiers were happy with the government.
They know what we did.
What city is he in?
I slept nine hours.
Tom says he wants to talk to Mari.
Tommy's gone.
I've made a lot of mistakes for myself.
It wasn't nice, but they were very nice brown eyes and nice smiles.
It's not a novelty.
What a shame!
I helped.
Do you love this country?
Green isn't good with the lion.
I don't think that's the kind of thing that's going on with the red ring.
Let's get closer to the goal.
The fire is very popular in Spain.
It's 30 euros.
You don't drink?
Two horses will be enough.
Give me a chance.
How important is your health?
How likely is that?
Tom missed us so much!
It's funny.
I slept.
Tom's got a chicken.
Anything else?
The car's ready.

Are you Tom?
I don't like it when they look stupid.
The bomb's been stolen within 10 seconds.
Not like you.
I'm going.
Honestly, you don't like your haircut.
Cigarettes.
I'm curious if Tom can come or not.
He just left the house.
Look at the cat on the roof.
Tom opened a tunnel.
We're both very, very lucky.
They need to be involved in success.
Tom's in a hurry.
Tell Tomina I'm just drinking green tea.
Tom promised to meet Mary in his place and in time.
The house looked good, and the price was good.
Do you like the rocket?
I don't want to work with Tom.
He knows who the father is.
She doesn't like the tea anyway.
You don't have any idea how true you are.
Tom's almost home every weekend.
Why should you be surprised at this?
It's the unalterable video.
The ship's been wrecked in the storm.
I already packed my stuff.
We've improved the burden.
Thank you again.

There's a bear here.
I just need some help.
And they just got out.
He got out of the dark.
Japan and Great Britain.
I want to get a book.
Take it safe.
Tom's been so upset, isn't he?
Tom's got a couple of beds out of the woods.
You can't pretend to be at work or go to college.
You're always ready.
Blood doesn't get water.
That would be different.
Please take him in.
Maybe he's lying.
That's the order, please.
Tom's gonna go.
Tom got a black hat.
How can we protect ourselves?
You know very well, I think.
Do you feel Chinese?
Let's not tell anyone that.
I'll let you choose.
You always get what you want?
Not now, darling.
He took off his sword.
Tom said first.
They're more dangerous than the rabbits.
Let me stay.
Tommy collected his keys.
I remember when you were just a little girl.
Tommy agreed to hope.
Tom's sleeping too fast.
Tom returned his gun.
Do you have any idea how we can solve this problem?
The money's coming all right.
Tommy continued the game.
He gave a piece of shit to his face.
I have another appointment tomorrow.
You're the new assistant?
They were so happy when we got here.
I don't believe in thunders.
The remote calls were expensive.
I'll help you.
My word is that I'm going to be about smoking.
What's the name of those tablets?
I can't do it anymore, I haven't slept for three days.
Tom hates strangers.
Tomot's sick with my type.
He loved me just as I loved him.
Why didn't anyone help Tamás?
I don't understand German.
It's a shame.
His words seem simple.

Despite Trang's refusal to love him, Spencer was still afraid that the girl would no longer care about him.

Let's go to the elevator.
He said he believed in his dreams.
That's what I said, but I didn't really think about it.
The cat's gone.
Tom's not as young as Mari.
You're leaving!
Tom spent his entire life studying cats.
He spoke very well in English for my surprise.
Tom is our oldest son.
He's in a good mood.
I'll always be in my heart.
I think it's possible.
What Tommy did is that he was an example of courage.
Tom is a very dangerous man.
I came to the station in time.
What's this place?
They're looking for Tamá.
Tom can't help it.
They're working all day.
No one in today's world believes in ghosts.
What happened on October 20th?
You know some of them already.
I don't know exactly.
We don't hear anything.
I thought you might know.
Where did you get the carrot on your face?
I want to go to England.
When Tom went to rest, his son took over his business.
I didn't get an invitation.
Tom told us to be patient.
Show him how to pull the trigger.
I want this to be prepared today.

Hold on a second.
Tommy said he'd call you back later.
Natural resources are not unlimited.
Give me the map!
He doesn't like the idea at all.
You're here.
We're moving in the next month.
I want to look around.
Tom will help you.
Tom's on the train.
Three years younger than Marin.
He was very old.
Prescriptive languages say the worst.
Tom's a good friend?
Let's sit down and talk out loud.
My father was a sweet-paced day that had eaten a lot of corn on his back all day.
Tom hasn't done much in his job lately.
Why is my sister so angry?
Use your life to create paradises.
Tom is a really great guy.
You know who made it?
That's amazing.
No one's sitting here.
Tom told you something, didn't he?
It's cold.
I got a letter from my mother last night.
He left his entire apartment in his office.
You do yourself anyway!
Give it up!
We've lost our money.
I'm not sure Tom wants to come with us to Boston.
Tom party.
I'd have waited.
When did the rain stop?
I think it's an accident.

I've had a lot of work.
They're thieves.
He'll get help.
I got up at 6:00 this morning.
Tom left his car behind.
The pandas worship the bambous.
Why didn't you help them?
I'm not a optimist right now.
Get up.
That's amazing!
You've got your hair.
You're ready.
That's what happened in the beginning of the previous week.
Are you talking about personal experience?
Can I come in?
That was a deep point, things have improved since then.
I don't know much about Russia.
You missed me.
It's an animal in the desert.
Tom looks like they're going to get together.
I think you're welcome.
Come with me.
The water was cold.
She offered me a gift that she was doing.
Get in there before you get in.
I'm a regular dog.
Please tell Tomina he has to go.
I usually drink two coffees with your food.
You were better.
The excess fats are getting worse because of oxidation.
How long has the ball been opened?
You're asking for some trouble?
Thank you.
We need to get ready for the future.
Mom, can I have a drink?
I gave all my money to my cousin.
I need that.
Turn your head over here.
What kind of food do you don't like?
I'd like to do it again.
I thought about Tom.
They were arrested.
I knew Tom wouldn't change.
Please close the door.
The sentence was held last night.
He pulled up his kitchen floor with a knife.
Tom's been driving around a long time.
Now we have a bigger problem.
Let's check it out.
Then make your house.
Do you have a brother?
Be nice, answer me.
You'll all miss.
Today, we are eating rice brought from Italy.
You didn't hesitate to help me with time and poverty because I'm very grateful.
You're out of your mind.
I know exactly who your dad is.
I think we've turned into a bad direction somewhere.
I opened it.
I felt totally alone.
Try to imagine the situation.
Why didn't they believe me?
Put your finger on the right side.
Don't judge anyone on the ground.
I'm so scared of you, ma'am.
Tom forgot to take his lunch today.
Why were you angry?
Shut the fuck up before you go.
Never lose hope!
I think I'm baha.
That's terrible.
Tom should have shut the door.
Tom works in a restaurant at Park Street.
At least you could say, "Thank you."
Tom told you not to?
I'm not sure about this.
Aren't you a fascist?
That's exciting.
I'm hoping it works.
He's in the process.
You can't talk to anyone about this.
There's a little treasure that's as valuable as a wise and helpful friend.
Tommy's been keeping an eye on what Mari said.
I didn't know I could do this.
Did you kill Tom?
I know who's in that house.
Tom asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee.
Your plan won't work.
You looking for someone?
I'll ask you a question.
That name doesn't mean anything to me.
Tom almost understood what Mari said.
This car eats a lot.
Say the words you don't understand.
The old man's not alive.
Mary's been hit by a sword.
It had a very powerful effect on me.
Be very happy.
There was nothing.
Tom never changes.
Well, isn't it a gymorrhage?
I know what's wrong with you.
He's crazy!
They're like idiots in school who's got bad news.
You know that?
Who suggested that Tom take this job?
You know where the problem comes from.
I'll eat rice.
It was a shame to do that.
I'm not working together.
Tom made the mistake.
What do we do?
I see this.
Tom Diabetes.
There was no water.
That's really nice.
They were so angry that they burned their tents.

Help him!
I hope he'll be asleep soon.
We can't let this happen to us.

You're a famous singer, aren't you?
Don't just throw it out because it's broken.
He said he just got the guitar.
I helped my mother grow up.
Why are you so angry?
The "person" multiple "people", not "people".
Let me get you something to drink.
Sometimes you'll get tired.
You can try.
I don't need your money.
I'm sorry you hurt so much.

Get out of here!
I feel like they're trying to break the easy ones, the killers and I'm afraid of the future.
I need to learn France.
I hope you stay in prison until you die.
This treasure can't fly.
Thank you for dinner.
Is there a map?
Tom's gonna get it.
Tom doesn't eat as much as Mari.

Where are the most important words?
You know who I am.
Your question has nothing to do with the subject.
What can I lose?
Why is Tamás still here?
I gave him a bullet.
I can't say much more.
My heart is young.
Not all listeners went there yesterday.
I'm glad you've been able to meet Tommy.

Tom and Mari, what did they call their babies?
I just wanted to do this.
The son's a bitch.
You'll see us tomorrow.
Why do you keep everything to yourself?
You've got a lot more of your brand than mine.
We tried everything to help her.
The Internet is not connected.
You don't have to do that anymore.
The month's gone.
I can't stay calm.
In Italy, in Geneva, 39 people were killed by a call.
My life has changed.
Now my life is completely different.
Come on, Tom.
Give me the food.
Would you let me go now?
Hands up!
I've got it.
These rocks are beautiful.
I'm a man.
I don't know how much this bike is going on.
They're playing.
We're living near a big library.
The same song was sung by Tom before all the sun.
He's missing because of his illness.
I'm not a barber.
Why do you care?
Obviously this is the most important point.
I hope Tom is with Mari now.
Is that right what you're doing?
He's gone home.
I'm so sorry.
I called Mari, but she refused.
I feel like I'm completely confused.
Tom told the party about some funny jokes that he had taken with some of his colleagues.
Get out of here!
I lost it in the house.
Tom took a moment for Mary.
That's enough.
Would you like me to get a little bit of a chirkecombot, please?
Get off me!
There's no one else.
I don't know if she's happy or not.
I told you I'm fine.
He's still waiting for you.
I'll live too long.
My DVD collection is very small.
Tom's out of work.
Tom's one.
I need to find a partial stand.
Tom doesn't have a good idea why he didn't come.
What Tom told Mary was not true.
No one asked Tom.
We'll leave it to you later.
Tell them where I am.
The hard work hasn't killed anyone yet, but why are we risking it?
We're curious.
There was no water in the cave.
Tom knows one.
What's going on?
The ninth dress was found in the skin.
I've got it.
You're my wife from the morning.
Is this the key you're looking for?
I hope no one has ever seen you.
Our teacher's coming home from abroad in August.
I'll wait here for Tom to come back.
Tell me about it!
I was still home then.
He's ready.
It's been dark.
I'm sorry, I'm wrong.
I didn't let Tom choose.
I always hear this question.
I don't care what Tamás said.
Tom has no practical experience.
Is this a baby boy or a girl?
First, take these bags out.
He was a kaistic.
This mountain is full of snow all year long.
The mayor's office is with the people.
I'm done!
Oh, but I'm glad to see you.
I know your family.
I love beer and wine.
Why don't you come over for dinner?
Who's that?
We better appreciate it.
I know who did it.
You're ready for dinner.
It's not a bank.
We're not going to die for anything.
Your house should be built.
Tommy's the only person who can do this job.
How did you find it?
Did you get my letter?
The book's white.
In one or another?
They were at the gathering at Harmincan right now.
It's easier to get to the bus.
The water's impossible.
I didn't help.
I wasn't the one who locked the door.
Tom's been very nice.
Tom seemed angry.
You're in one?
I'm not telling you the truth anymore.
It's not good.
My full name is Ricardo Vernaut.
Tom didn't become a murderer.
Maris?!
Tominas will need our help.
The cats have nine lives.
Moses' hands.
You have to get up early tomorrow.
They need a hero.
They trust each other.
I'm sorry.
I don't like him very much.
Go faster!
Which one would you like to film?
They were white-haired kids.
I want to know why Tom did this.
Tom paid the money back.
I give him my word.
Tommy threw Mari out.
Do you think he knows I love you?
Where do I live?
Tom's still breathing.
He hates the green pepper.
I can go.
I'm sorry.
A guy who was a bad guy, he started following.
Make a car!
My family's Malaysians.
Mari doesn't know how lucky she is.
Tom was very upset.
It's just like that.
It's too hard.
The new hairstyle makes you a young man.
The boy's gone.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm not an expert.
They're footballers.
Look around.
We lost three games after each other.
Who made this picture?
Tom was very active.
I didn't laugh.
I kept my promises.
Maria's not poor.
Tom doesn't believe in ghosts.
There's something I forgot to tell you.
We have information available.
The teacher's teaching.
I don't understand you.
I forgot about you.
Mari took Tom to the dance park.
Tominas had a stop.
Get your ass off!
Everything was so beautiful!
Tom dropped his hotel address.
I can't help you.
The girl who's reading the book, Kate.
Tom says it's a lie.
Zurich, a city in Switzerland.
Can you see him away?
I'm Tom's sister.
Why can't I go to Boston?
Tommy showed me the line he made of Mari.
It's so quiet in the house.
Let's be great with our competitions.
I had a drink this morning.
My sister's always losing her weight.
They're trying to express their interest in humanity.
There's no life insurance.
I don't have anything to lose.
You did it right, didn't you?
We've got a better estimate.
He's never meant anything.
We talked about Tomir.
You're avoiding him.
He's got more books than you have.
Looks like you don't feel anything good here.
Tom's physically and spiritually cold.
I'm sorry about Tom?
Still sick?
He's driving a shoebox.
You'll need a key.
Everyone's proud, just not me.
There's no better than a good source shower.
He burned a cake for me.
It's all going out to Rome.
That's how I know.
One fourth is always black, but one fourth is not always black.
How stupid a joke!
Great, then we'll see you in front of the movie.
You need to learn more.
There's never such a thing going on in Boston.
The path leading to the village is very narrow.
What's up?
We didn't do anything.
I'm Tominal.
Did you know Tom?
I'm the associate of the local drug dealer.
Do you hear me?
I'm not happy with that.
Go ahead.
The city's population has chosen him as a cleaning officer.
Anything you can do.
I could answer her question.
What the hell are you doing here?
They're just waiting for you.
It's important.
How did your test work out?
I don't like her coming home this often.
Be nice to meet you.
I want to go back to my hotel.
I didn't see him today.
I always come first.
I'm glad it's all right.
I'm a trucker.
I'm looking for my contact link.
That's 10 fort.
The Japanese are Asians.
You don't have to talk respectfully about the dead.
It's been a long time.

I should've seen it coming.
Tom's got cancer.
We've got a wedding anniversary today.
Just listen and learn.
What's our name?
He took me a knife.
Tom's still sitting.
Where is he now?
There's a sign on the top of the list, "sale".
You'll never know if you don't ask.
It happens between us and God, my job is to organize the meeting.
Tommy knew my Mari secret.
The search picks up the map from the road.
It's my pleasure to have a funeral.
We went to Canada.
I can hardly remember that.
How much did he get in?
How did you learn this?
I wish I knew where he was!
I don't know what Tom's doing.
What are you gonna eat?
It's hard to speak English?
When are you going to your business trip?
I need some rest, Tomina.
I just want you to think about me some time.
Tom didn't tell the truth.
They're better than their teeth.
I don't care about time.
I told you three weeks ago.
If you don't like it, you can go.
He bought a new car.
He doesn't like the sorghum, so he didn't eat it.
You trust Tommy's ability to judge.
I think it's innocent.
That's a long story.
Would you help me get the table down?
Tom took care of Mari's son while Mari worked.
Who killed him?
What is your favorite programming language?
You know the tree.
Have a good time for breakfast.
He's always attacking others.
Tom wasn't young.
I'm tired.
You're good, aren't you?
We'll be right back.
Why don't you help Tamás?
There are people who talk at home.
I didn't understand what the book was about.
Tommy's been reading an ancient drawing.
I'm just drinking for a week.
It's very painful.
My dad gave me a lot of money.
I didn't find Tom.
You have to trust me, you have no choice.
He's usually coming here as a pleasure.
Don't be sorry.
We had a good time yesterday.
Won't you stay for a tea?
Don't be too tight.
You're not my boss.
You're just gonna need a decoy.
Tom left school.
He's here.
When do we see each other?
We've broken the chain.
Who's making him breakfast?
They've been waiting for more than an hour.
Let's tell the truth.
He's driving around.
In 776 B.C.E., the first Olympic Games were held at the foot of the Olympics in the Greek capital, Zeus.
You like it now?
That'll be fine.
I only have ten books.
Tommy surprised us.
Did you know them?
Tommy's a roommate.
She doesn't like kids.
There's no one here to say hello.
He's just gone from death.
I'm sorry.
I'd have received a deadly heart attack.
They say they'll soon leave Tokyo.
Where did you get these clothes?
Tommy chose the colors.
There's nothing in my chest.
It's a family picture of a porcelain made by hand.
Was that you?
Tom died of cancer.
He was more patient.
Are you really friends?
It's not possible to negotiate.
We've been sceptical.
I'm a little tired.
They're reading the churches.
That was a big deal on the roof.
Can it happen?
Don't attack me!
It's necessary.
We don't have to do this.
Tom didn't do it alone.
Three dinners.
My dog's white.
The pancake can turn the man upside down.
Tom, we're scared, aren't we?
You need to be more careful.
My grandfather works a hotel.
It'll stop them.
I've always dreamed I'd live abroad.
The city is beautiful.
We should help each other.
We're strong together.
Tom's gonna drive.
It's locked under the ice.
Your sister's a well-known TV star.
He'll travel abroad in the future.
I hope you'll be better soon.
What if something happened to her?
Buddhism comes from India.
He's home.
Help him.
What are you doing?
I'm sure my mom didn't say anything.
One more fruit.
He took a deep breath.
I'm sorry about the kids.
Is your mom here?
Tom's got it.
Gyalog's here.
Tom's hungry.
You know, you're wrong.
Let's get the lights up.
You can't afford it.
One more time.
Tom's operating a lift in a shop.
What do I find in the box?
You should have listened to everyone.
Who's allowed to name things?
He didn't ask why he just did it.
How do we get more names?
I was very nervous.
Many films are made of low-cost, independent films.
You have to be hotter.

Tommy stopped and Marira died.
It's enough for everyone.
Tom's team is the only one that's been done many times.
This is my horse.
Our university is outside Tokyo.
Shut up!
The boy looked like an adult.
Tom smells like a dick.
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.
Tom can't get in his shoes.
He made me a new dress.
I think it's time for a career change.
I saw the car crash.
Let me do it again.
Most people are more sensitive to the political position than to the evidence.
I don't think Tom knows the details.
I don't like to exchange my books for anyone.
We've become honest.
He doesn't want to work.
Ask Tama to wait a minute.
I think so.
They're gone.
I decided I'd go with you.
Tom and Mary Valentin were married on their wedding day.
Although I explained in detail to Tom, he was not capable of doing the right thing.
I think we'll deal with him.
Tommy's focused.
I gave you flowers.
What makes you think those guys don't want to kill us?
My father was on the farm.
You can't wait for the surgery.
Man wants to feel useful.
How did you like Boston?
Cookie broke his arm and took it.
I'm not gonna be here tonight.

A good idea came in the last minute.
I have to do more.
I know it hurts my ass when there's rain.
Is the fast bread really sick?
What are you trying to prove now?
Did you see how it works?
Don't look at your fingertips.

Tom's unconfirmed.
Tom's a good teacher?
It happened last night.
When you buy materials from unknown sellers, you need to be careful.
Tom can't sleep, and neither can I.
I'm not just a French teacher.
He who sleeps doesn't follow him.
We don't use it for a while.
You know what they say.
Some of us could talk to Tom.
Get your fucking hands off Tommy!
Sit where I see you.
We need to talk a lot about everything, you and me.
They're cops!
Why would they recommend that?
Tommy and Mari often text each other even if they're in the same house.
What's this?
I can't drive a bus.
The pure soul can also be married.
I miss you so much!
I can't let myself pay for anyone.
Stay here, please.
Our traditional way of life no longer exists.
You should've done that tommal.
Tom had no money, no work.
You were in love.
He's got three nice diamonds.
You can't help Tom.
I have to read this book tomorrow.
Tom lost his temper.
Everyone's sick.
I'll die, my hands hurt.
Who are you talking to, Tom?
They were better off.
What's your favorite espresso beauty?
Tom's the best.

Not without your family.
My father lived in Nagoya for more than ten years.

Please, let's speak more English.
That's not what I wrote.
She gave him a book.
I'm sure I've got something important for you.
Is there anyone else here?
I'm going to sell it.
I'm interested in Japan's story.
I haven't bought anything lately.
I don't have the power to do this anymore.
We don't believe that.

They saw something strange.
There's fish in the sea.
Mari's as bad as an ocean.
You should start.

Ten million yen won the lottery.
I think you're in a bad mood.
Tom put his gun under his pillow.
I hate it, too.
It's sending your attention.
How can a person achieve success?
We're on our way.
I think you should forget that.
That's my problem.
I've got five today.
You're amazing.
Tom checked the date.
We'll be right back.
Get up, Tom!
This provision is in effect for the future.
I'm twelve.
I'd rather love the cheese than the rice.
My mom's not here.
It's a sad end to the story.
Wait a minute.
The patient's more alive than he's dead.
They weren't at home.
I'm a bookmaker.
You're talking awfully on Sunday.
Well, at least he's been crazy about the pain after the kids died.
Thank you for the gift.
He's not here yet.
Tom can talk.
Someone came ten minutes ago.
Do you really want me to dance with you?
I can't get him.
Did Tom go to school?
Where did this happen?
I didn't know Tommy was already dead.
It's gonna be a bad end, son.
We haven't taken a girl yet.
Even if I knew as much as you.
What color did Tom wear?
Everything's possible.
You're gonna stop with the money.
Tell me where you've been hiding.
He hasn't taken any knowledge of it all day.
They're looking for the news.

That's very nice!
You're crying for help.
We're all eleven.
Do I put all the meat in the air?
Tom's gone, so he's been looking for cover.
The old woman's bitch.
Don't make things worse for yourself.
I heard from someone that today's work was exactly the same as last year.
I can't let it go.
The hair was very nice.
I need someone I can talk to.
I'm absolutely sure it's true.

He doesn't want children.
Come in!
Who's in jail?
Tom refused military service.
Put out the words you don't need.
What a short life!
I love small towns.
I'm gonna hurt you.
It's a joke, too.
Is there a plan?
Who's going to go?
Tom's gonna get out of the mountain.
I don't think you were convincing enough.
There's a glass on the table.
Don't turn this off.
We've got a new neighbor.
There's a page for you on your own.
I don't like people who don't know.
Tom wasn't always so happy.
Tom has a hard heart.
You're making precautions?
From the distance, he looked like a human face.
I'll keep listening to you.
What do we use from this?
Mari came to me this morning.
In contrast to you, I don't make a fool of people before the public.
You shouldn't have.
Maybe he wouldn't have killed Tom if he had been in bed.
Take it!
I look forward to the best of all.
Tommy didn't want us to do this.
Did Tommy teach you to dance?
They won't accept the gifts.
I'm living in Boston right now.
I need a bigger secret.

Wow!
I think I'm capable of it.
Tom's better.
There's a book about a dance on the table.
I don't want them to forget.
These two euros are the price.
Tom's dreaming himself.
Listen to me, please.
That's a good word.
Let Mary do the thing.
I didn't.
I'll have you dinner at 8:00.

It was impossible to control his desire for murder.
Is he my friend?
I need to get out of here.

Look at this picture.
There you go.
It's just very obvious.
How long have we been friends?
I'll always lose my wife.
Everything, it's just not worth it.
When are you coming back?
Tom's not as smart as you are.
You see people in the park?
Are you here to live there?
Did you call last night?
I can't make that much money.
Tom's been looking at me again, and he's gone.
I'm a rock.
I know Tom's patient.

He's looking twice as much as I do.
Tom has changed a lot since high school.
Why did you take this bike?
I hope it's just a trap.

It's got the effect of the sea.

It's not mine.
He was ready to go.
Tom's been fine for a long time.
She's happy to pay her husband for the present.
Actually, what happened?
Don't come in!
Put it in his pocket.
Is he your girlfriend?

We'll always be here.
Tom was nervous.
Do you drink alcohol?
I hope the rain is alive.
I'm having trouble with my feet.
Tommy's got the dress on his feet.
It's a dead piece of paper.
Tommy often writes about his friends in his blog.

We're starting to be careful.
They're keeping my mouth shut.
As soon as he saw it, he left.
I can't lie.
Why don't you try him?
Tom's been asking.
I've got to get to it.
You're taking a lot?
Someone's out there.

I want to live in Tampa.
What are you gonna do with your lunch?
Tom loves it.
Statistics show that our lifestyle is high.
I'm sweet.
The hope is dead.
Maybe Tom doesn't know about the danger.

Women are people, too.
You're in the picture.
Are you bleeding?
Take him away!

I'm planning on going there.
Just think you're gonna have to move.
I don't doubt that.
How did you get there?
It's too small for me.
That took courage.
Tommy's here?
- Thank you, no, I've had enough.
Tommy's still playing.
Same age as I do.
When did you meet Tom?
They're gone.
Tommy never knew that.

Have you been successful?
You have to choose between honor and death.
I think you got it.
Tom never told the authorities that.
You're gonna give me your car?
There's one or two more things you need to put in your skin.
I'll see you soon.
