Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president of the United States
The American President Barack Obama will come to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to take over the peace prize as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a gift of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will meet with his wife Michelle in the Norwegian Metropolis tomorrow and will be busy all the time.
At first, he took a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he first met with the five Committee members who had chosen him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then arranged a meeting with King Harald V. and King Sonja.
The next day, the visit will reach its peak with the ceremony, with Obama taking over the award price.
He receives this as the fourth US President, but only as the third one who takes the price directly from the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will be talking about the Afghan war at the price.
The President does not want to raise this issue because he knows that he is taking over the price as a president leading to war in two countries at the time of the war.
He has strengthened the war efforts a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to mention.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medals, the diploma and the sign over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to spend money for prosperous purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific feature work.
The event programme then proposes a banquet with the President and his wife, where the Prime Minister and 250 other guests outside Norway will also be present.
Obama was very persistent at the price from the beginning.
For example, he pointed out that he felt that he didn't deserve the price at all.
On several occasions, he also repeated that the price does not only apply to him, but also to all those who want the same values as he wants.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was a "requirement for action" for him.
Natural protection is charged with the repression
The Leitmeritz police accused the presidents of the Civil Protection Community of Leitmeritz of repression.
In several cases, in the last year, he introduced training against certain construction procedures, and for the recovery of his profession, he requested money from the investors for his benefits, said the leader of the police, Alena Romova.
The President of the Leitmeritz-Natural Protection Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and he's been sentenced to three years in prison.
The Sorter Müll Containers in Brünn don't smell good
In Prague, people can sort out the drinking packs, in the South Sea resorts you will find the Sorter-Müll Container again and again.
And in Brünn?
There you had to book a few minutes to find the suitable multons.
I do not want to assume that waste training in Brün would not work at all.
But I would like to know whether the Council is concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brinn is located in the waste strip in the Urvaldlag, not only because we as citizens here can always provide only paper, glass and plastics, but especially by the number of multons for such wastes.
Have they ever tried to take out the PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is very art, it needs time and strong nerves.
The only place I've ever found casually is the seaplace against the caught gangs.
Mr Onderka should not worry about his colleagues, but that is too much for me.
In addition to the fact that waste collection is not honey in other parts.
So all the rows of my friends don't even like the waste.
From weakness.
It's too far to the mollusks.
I'm not surprised.
I have offered myself after the party to provide some glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova Street, I haven't seen any colourful tones in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the road.
But the mull was almost over.
But this is still the centre of Brünn, which represents the whole city, right?!
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetic are likely to call the authors of socialists.
They prefer to buy the city an Eishockeyliga, which makes us a shame throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few multons more and offering the sortling of other raw materials for a cleaner fuel.
I am pleased that I could also confirm my opinion with official statistics after I have been looking for a way on the Internet.
According to the data provided by the ECO-COM society, Brün is really in the southernmost region.
The Paroubek budget has removed the money for interest and sickness
After the left party has given more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no money in the budget for interest, sickness and construction business.
But not for public debt or for the international court.
This causes even more problems that will be in the government in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister Edward Janato.
When the social Democrats and Communists have carried out the increase in wages for some groups, they have calculated that the government spends money in addition to the emotional expenditure, ageing rates or the level of illness. "This is just an upsetting of the problems in the future, mining," says Janato.
Credits are paid slightly higher interest rates, and money must be restored at any time.
Too much to choose, where to take the state tax is empty.
If social services or costs are not reduced for the state business, the taxes shall be increased.
For all those who now gave more money to the left party: the fires, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for their children.
In order to reduce the interest rate or the level of sickness from which the account has been lost 1.8 billion people have no fear of receiving this money.
However, the price of the state is even greater - in the next year, not only 163 billion will be lost in the state budget but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janato, forgiveness will be increasing as quickly as possible and with it the costs and benefits.
The state will need the money for the balance, then it will no longer be sufficient to raise VAT only in a small way or to cut the maternity money, as the government did in its reverse-fiction package.
In the coming year, some electoral groups will also lack five billion to build cars and railways.
It is too much about the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly redesigned.
At least get what's not free.
This means surrendering or setting up thirty large construction works, it is also dangerous for the European fuel generation, warns the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the flow of money in salmonically - it reaches the CEZ activists where the state is the owner of the majority, and then the money will be saved into the transport fund.
The problem is that the height of the dividend is never safe and it doesn't, in any case, be an infinite source.
In the previous year, CEZ 18 billion flows into the budget.
Each year, the dividends will pay environmental damage liquidity, the pension account will be filled and this money will also serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trend increases the actual budget deficit at the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP according to EU rules.
However, this does not end the carnival of the conversions.
Nearly three billion were paid the budget for various damages to the victims of communism and punishments or for applications to the judiciary, even for the construction of buildings.
Whether the state comes without this money, it's not safe.
That's a good luck game.
If we lose an international court, then we have to pay it as well, Janato makes it clear.
The Minister must then save the money resources or, in the worst case, attack the government's budgetary resources.
One hundred million are also missing for the two-billion-billion-dollar project, which should allow on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend on money.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project had to be closed and sanctions would be imposed, Janato warned.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans calculate the future with a phone that enables the user by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The proposed plans look promising.
It's enough to press just one key, and from Windows Mobile it's going to be in less than a second in the Android exchange.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to offer, which focuses primarily on the development of the virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on the phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate these into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, stated Srinivas Krishnamurti by VMware company at the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in the last year of November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
There will be 2012 on the market.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM store, at the same time living on the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full practice.
The VMware company is now working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualisation and is expected to come to customers within 2012.
Snowmallows on the mountains serve the hotel owners
Scleolese pistons do not only concern the residents of the Rieging Mountains.
The missing snow also distracts people from ordering skiing in hotels and pensions.
That is why you can still get free rooms for all winter terms incl. Christmas and Easter.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offer, fix the prices, but they fear to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether our opinion will be on snow or "by match" after this year's Christmas party, the information portal operator Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, asked.
Anyone who wants the silver-silvester suspension in the spindle mühl just according to his suggestions should no longer hesitate to comply with the order.
Anyone who prefers the spa and who only comes to second place to the quality of the stay can wait a few days.
The Spindelmülle hotel owners offer over a week's holiday only between the winter.
I think they'll try to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to follow, and they'll have to come in for a while.
And then the free rooms will be washed fast, dear Jandura.
Free beds in all winters are always available at the Intours travel office in Vrchlabi.
Now most of us are interested in the Christmas week that has not yet been sold.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas holidays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel office Intours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvester day in Riegingberge can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
In this year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Rieging Mountains.
People wait for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pitches are cold within a week, it will also be sold at night, i.e. shippert.
Turn around and something better than in the last year, it is possible to rent the rooms in the Hotel Horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On Saturday and Christmas, we have just a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in January, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also located in the central park of Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still free on Christmas Eve at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were surprised by this year of January, for which we are now about 60 percent.
A little weaker is between February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stay in the Rieging Mountains is also increasing, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a larger snowfall, the Riegongsberg hotel owners were waiting.
On Thursday it should rest and if it comes to low ground, it should be on the mountains snow.
But then another heating was to come, Jiri Jakubsky informed him of the location of the Czech Weather Agency in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Restoration is mother of courage
It is almost comical, with which student activity Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the complainant, resumed his strategy in the Afghan question, which he himself held for the stupidest.
When he finally expelled his supposed Afghan doctor, he showed himself that he had written this over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq-Szeario for three years.
Not only that he used the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Path" without delay.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea - fresh troops continuum in Iraq, which was fought by the civil war - as a "responsive and charistrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which is based on the recommendations of the military, was the only possible and, as long as it was very successful, that today in the news about Iraq, there is no more talk.
The noise of Bush was not improved by this, because he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will continue.
In order to boost the troops' contingent, the military again prayed to him, especially the commander of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating habits, strongly criticised the silent protections in the White House.
He asked 40,000 soldiers to change the situation for the better.
The President delayed three months, but he did not come to any better idea, and thus he was in favour of 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has printed the bid for another 5,000, even though he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
The greatest problem with the entire Obama strategy is its intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to conclude this process within three years. The entire Obama doctor leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half the rise will have the same effect as the measures in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of the last few years, Iraq's society has been well structured relatively well, and its leaders have respected the values.
The Afghan situation is caused by the counter-indication - no one can leave and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they have been properly established, remain only rail structures, after which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The exchange of interest between the various ethnic groups is unusual, especially because of the invisibility of relations that continue to complicated Pakistan and Iran's influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "handling-like state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy promoted by its volunteerism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only been worse and is now at the edge of the explosion.
They believe that the small soldiers who have broken into the war record on the "Morning" are creating a miracle here can only be a really romantic soul that can't be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the troops' withdrawal is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will take it as the indirect condition of the US downset.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is a challenge.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Indian-Geburg advance.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions on Iran, a very difficult question arises for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved by troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which Obama fled from Afghanistan to the United States.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic use of the Afghan situation.
The only trust bottle for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to reach another strategy, if this would be a total case.
The manager of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receives a prize bonus in bar
The leading executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs won't receive any prizeboni this year.
This has been announced by the company that has responded to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive instead of the money shares, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers in the case of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters agency, is on the top of the efforts to connect the Wall Street Premieboni with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of the criticism after it had set almost $17 billion for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of the premiumboni over this year is likely to exceed $20 billion even after the Reuters Agency has shown the measure today.
The high premiums in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the beginning of the financial crisis.
The United Kingdom reported on Wednesday that it was intended to charge the banker's boni, which exceeds 25,000 pounds, directly with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also in preparation for France.
In this year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all news except in physics.
Five recorded women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden, Carl XVI. Gustav took the Nobel Prizes this year in professional categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, he was also among the German writers of the Romanian heritage, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their Landsmann Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone field.
The price for Chemistry has been received by the Israeli Ada Jonathan along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to clarify the structure and function of the Ribosom.
The last Laurentin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her Landsmann Oliver Williamson had received for analysis of the economic report.
The only professional category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize in this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for research in the glass industry and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip discovery, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remotes.
Each of these ministers received the diploma, the Nobel laureate and the certificate of the acquisition of the prize.
It consists of ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizes in each category, the price of money will be divided among them.
According to tradition, American President Barak Obama has already received the most expected peace Nobel Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the contradictions of his appointment because he was only at the beginning of his journey, and also at the top of the country, which leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janato is considering his return. Klaus invited him to the castle.
On Friday, President Vaclav Klaus welcomed the Minister of Finance, Edward Janota, who was thinking about his stay in the government, because he did not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that he was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It will be accepted that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the subjects of the holiday effort.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Premier, Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget budget, which is now under signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, Parliament adopted proposals on the link-party proposals for monetary union and increased the money for state officials, for the content of social services and direct payments of farmers.
The Government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it covers the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, the Class and the Legal Party on the other, a serious internal political dispute arose, thereby raising the question of the further work of the Fisheries Agency, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed on in the morning.
Critics argued that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, would actually liquidate the package of savings that were carried out by the fisheries government in the autumn, and that, according to their understanding, the State debt should be terminated.
Klaus, who is able to sign the law on the state budget, did not have to explain today's discussion with the entrepreneurs that politicians have been putting their trust in the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is serious, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS chairperson, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the office network with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
Premier Fischer referred to similar words as "strong excuses".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was serious that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year and exceeded 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claimed that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undead" of the world shows a lot of the country's struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was being played by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fight against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, appears in his life story of the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was praying from the nine-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role is taken by Matt Damon.
I told him, "When I play you, I have to meet you.
The two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box, already showed the leader of the movement to get rid of the slave, from which he had become a slave holder, a strong president of the United States, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely someone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman had been in prison for his active activity in completing apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990, and for four years he was president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unscattered", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The demand was how to speak.
The film portrays a real event, with Nelson Mandela's forces with the head of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to join the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can tell his people through the sport, so he decides to join the football players who are among the world's outsiders.
Finally, the South African team rises to the world Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the Kinole River.
He had no other goal than to play this role to bring it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politicians were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him at night and be behind the cults before his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shoot Mandela's hand.
I've determined if I'm gonna shoot your hand, I'm gonna take your energy, it's going to pass, and I've felt like I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to be another person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, the head of the national football team, where the white players have reviewed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hardy world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I heard at the Turklingel that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film I look much larger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the structure of the actors compared to their actual figures, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the Eastwood Director "Invictus: Unclosed" and also speaks of views on an Oscar.
The film critic of the Blue Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, recorded his assessment in the following words: "It was a very good story, very well film produced."
In the film reviews on the website rotenatoes.com, Invictus 76 percent received positive reviews.
Light mystery solved via Norway: The Russians tested a rocket
Over Norway, a special light effect was observed from unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence announced yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again, and the rockets, originally called "Bulava", which should be the steel of the Russian army, will soon become the Alpine of the Russian generality and the prime minister Vladimir Putin.
Also, his continued presence at the rocket test had no positive impact on the success of the pilots.
Bulava is not usually started or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, you already write about "Bulava" as a "Rake that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This is already 13. Try it, it's normal at first.
Technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" began from the Atom-U-boot Dmitrij Donskij, which was under the water of the white sea.
This rocket type enables the board from the U-boot.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an uncertain flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
On the contrary, the generality has maintained itself this time and claimed that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two levels of rockets do not fall out, and by accident only the third level was affected.
In the previous cases the engines were likewise damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start has been made without error, the Ministry of Defence's leadership is only six to thirty success.
The almost fifty-five percent success is therefore met with optimism and is further claimed that the "Bulava" will once fly without problems and even ten hyperscal atoms will be carried with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow with 51 years of age.
The legendary opponent Vjaceslav Fetisov is again in a professional eishockey game with 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympics and Stanley Cup -owner assists his team CSKA Moskau in the need, and it is likely already taking place in the KHL Warehouse against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career in 1998 with 14 years, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another player.
Fetisov has been trained regularly and agreed to support the team.
We need to clarify just a few other formalities, the Agency AP quoted the Coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous Eishockey player is only about a game.
I believe that Fetisov is one of these who can attract the moral of other players, leading players Nemcinov up.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice area, he will follow the AP of the oldest Russian professional iceckey game.
In the NHL, the legendary Stormer Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford with 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful Eishockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championships and also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected success in the NHL, where he twice the Stanley Cup over the head of the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Eishockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave the trade unions back. All over the hours will be raised.
The business management of the Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai agreed with the company to stop all over hours.
Because of frequent scheduled overtime, the trade on Monday announced the strike.
This was confirmed by the speakers of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the business management wants to share with the trade unions a Saturday this week.
We cannot put forward our completion plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed on the ground that two workshops would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered 400 CZK a bonus to employees who would work on Saturdays.
The staff will also receive them in the neighbourhood for the Saturday Saturday, November 28.
Vanek therefore decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they will be able to pay the overtime fee or they can take a vacation on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek led up.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shop are paid the driver's money and the average.
In the light of the fact that the hours of the most urgent and burning point concerning the requirements and complaints of the trader which had imposed the production last week, the business leader decided yesterday morning with immediate effect on the withdrawal of all the hours of the trader for December.
The staff of the car factory had been forced to work up to the last week, practically every day after the eight-hour shift for 2 hours.
With the signing of the Agreement, the alert shall be withdrawn from the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the automotive industry and trade unions should be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that, if they can sign on to meet the requirements and sign a common document, they will be ready to raise the alert.
The location in the car factory has been estimated last week, on Wednesday, as about 400 workers spanted spontan because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged schemes.
The business management said that employees had to make the hours spent in keeping with the car supply requirement.
The trade unions also claimed that no sanctions would be imposed on workers who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions need to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, in this year, they require the payment of 5,000 crowns.
The Nosovic Automobile Factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured, which currently accounts for 200,000 vehicles per year.
Chechnya detection: a substance that also affects HIV-related viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new links that should link the spread of HIV viruses to the organization.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact ignores the fact that the association with normal viral variants does not work as hard as one of the medicines already available.
The AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
Patients may, however, prolong their life and prevent the increase in HIV infection in the body.
However, its intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
In addition, incomplete stress of virus infection has resulted in the development of resistance to drugs that are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technology School) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way for the introduction of virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as methylcarbons are active on the protein that is responsible for the reduction of HIV virus.
Metal carbonates are compounds of salt, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus contamination in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists obtained new improved links, which were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
Metalcarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-phase layers consisting of carbon, hydrogen and carbon atoms and combined with a metal atom, in this case Cobalt.
Domestic and permanent virus
HIV protease is an essential component of the HIV virus, which is indispensable for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV strain caused by the HIV protease, there would be no large proportion of infections.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus in the patient's body, explain the scientists in the press report issued by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe the whole range of connections in which two pairs of purchases (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is then systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable.
The impact of this range of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagen glass, as well as their constant (resistant) variants that were obtained by HIV infected patients.
The effect of metallocarbone on the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinical use of medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant agents, against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical events, makes the metalocarbons interesting for further links to the development of effective anti-HIV medicinal products, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the Laboratory for Structure Biology of the Institutes for Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS went off to Fischer, who's back.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for the next year as "grainful" and the government of Premier by Jan Fischer should survive its further existence.
The speaker of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong accusations".
It's probably time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS president, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the office office, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, is obviously no longer working.
After Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to support the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he is going to stay in Parliament's office with the help of the links.
The involvement of ODS and social Democrats in the problems of public deficits is different, and Necas has pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for the year 2010 on Wednesday, however, with proposals for a left-wing amendment of more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for state officials, the content of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it covers the budget deficit.
Chechnya should have a decline of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, as it has followed the government's will, because the amended budget is only a minor version of the budget provisor. Frase not clear
Dissemination and insensibility
Minister of Finance, Edward Janato, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, although Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janato was seriously threatened with his return to the case, the amendments would be accepted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janato was registered for Monday after the government business at the premium.
In this he indicated that he transferred his further stay to the office.
That is why he was disappointed with the budget's interpretation.
In the meantime, fishermen have argued for the further fight against the budget deficit, so that, according to Necas, the nominees of social democracy (CSDD) who had made the changes in the budget did not do anything in the government.
The Premier should also make it clear that he will return if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or services legislation.
Topolanek: Ministers designated by ODS do not regret
That's the case of the Premier Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers designated by ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek has raised a text message from the United States.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries there are people who are familiar with TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if Fischer decides to ignore the fight against the deficit of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that he is on the left side, which is currently in Parliament."
Then he can't count on the support and tolerance of the citizens.
I have not thought about it, and if this is the current one, I will deal with it, said Mr Bartak to the journalists in Parliament named by the democratic defence minister Martin Bartak.
Premier Fischer flew to Brussels in the morning to the European Council meeting.
ODS returns to the wish of the primer
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday, if the Premier specifically asked the members of the citizens' Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not expect to be a widow, we are not a small child, so he replied to the question whether the ODS was not back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the president in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
As soon as I forgot the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, in particular, it would go to the polls and the destruction of all positives, Topolanek himself would react.
Following the new drive plan of the CD (Czech Railways) less trains will be driven for about the same train price.
The Czech rail train ends or limits from 13 December to 13 December some smaller speed and local trains, other connections are strengthened.
The total volume of transport is reduced by 2 per cent from the day of validity of the new road plan compared to today.
Most prices incl. base and customer travel rates are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area will receive several connection opportunities in the capital, which sets the rail for this route trains of the Pendolino type.
The speed train will no longer be driven to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, essentially reducing direct connections from Prague to Latvia.
The largest reduction is the railways in the Hradec Kralove region (Königsgraz), totaling about eight percent, can be enjoyed on an increase in Prague and the environment.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis street and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis track will be reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem.
It is about the fifteenth road of the Esko pre-transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance to the main city will be completed at the Prague - Main Train Station.
The CD leads more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Summit/Jesenik will be driven within two hours.
With the Pendolino, the passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional bus: an increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, totalling the railway to compare the so-called liquidity loss in the next year of the next four billion crowns, as in this year. Local trains provide the areas, totaling eight billion crowns for which the state has three billion.
In this year, the regional trains are worth 200 million Czech crowns.
For local trains and fast trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract until now, the contract has been concluded only for one year.
The railway is praising the system, which may well have not been able to increase prices in the vast majority of the rails.
To change, it only comes with online CD Net and with cheap online eLska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD net will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLska will then depend on the route taken until now he was one and cost 160 crowns for travel between the cities of the region.
More than 50 people in the Philippines are arrested, the children were released.
Millitante today led 75 people to the southern Philippines, including some basic schools and their teachers.
This was introduced by the Agency AFP, which informed only about 65 extracts.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
It was taken to the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 million were reportedly used as a living shield in the flight before the police.
The local negotiating leaders now strive to publish the rest of the gospel.
According to the AFP agency, the militias belong to the nuclear army (NPA), which is the armament fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police persecuted the perpetrators because of the violence, which required negotiations between the two local families.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Magindano, was killed because of the recent massacre, where 57 people were killed, the standard law was upheld.
Among the victims of the massacre on November 23, which coincided with the election in the Governor's Chamber, were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested because of his suspicion of participation in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, the peace negotiations with the Philippines were resumed.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods is included in the American cinemas "Invictus: the Undead", which is part of the life story of the former presidents of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been achieved by Morgan Freeman, who had been elected by Mandela a few years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
The film's cinematography is also the reaction of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
He was born on July 18, 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar price, and in 1993 he joined the Klerk in the peace Prize.
He was elected to the Presidents of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Many expectations are set in the film, as it comes into the cinemas, which, on the one hand, in South Africa, fosters preparations for the world empire, but at the same time, the media are threatening the world's public with confusing news about the growing racehass and the discrimination of the inhabitants from the black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are initially positive, despite numerous reservations against the imposition of major patrols with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his own words after the new film.
From this role, I've been dreaming for many years and prepared well for it.
On several occasions I met Nelson Mandela personally so that I - as you say - could receive his energy, he took the interview after the film's finals in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we, with this film, remember Mandela's personality and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human, it added.
In the Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the British author John Carlin's proposal, which is free to translate 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that unites the people, the South African human rights defenders represent within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together groups of people of two races and of one age and one day, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also takes part in his role in the South African National Round Road on the World Cupfield, which he won at the time in South Africa.
For the participation of the race in the Dress, which is almost as valid as a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela has received large ovaries decades ago, mostly from the white public and has thus won the recognition of the white people.
The Rugbymistership may bring together the people again to a single people, led by the Rugbybysher Williams, who was the only "Black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, it will be shown first.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, such as in recent interview for LN of Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Mastership begins on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers are burning for several 10 million crowns
The fire came out to the transformer of the company Ceps in the power plant in the town of Vyskov in the Louny area.
At the fire, we met six units, according to the speaker of the district fire station Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan.
Initially, the fire was going to burn the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire will be removed with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer-in-currency closure.
No one was injured, the Havarie was not threatened by the company spokesman, Pavla Mandava, the security operation of the management system.
The damage has been estimated on several 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be attributed to the fire.
The damaged transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandava.
For more than 10 years, Ceps has had nothing in common with the company. Errors of this kind are rare, they added.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, according to the CEZ spokesman for northern banks, Sona Holingerova, and the capacity of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire of the Trafostation.
A.G. Ceps is operating in the Czech area as the sole operator of the steering system, the power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 switch systems with 67 transformers that transfer electrical energy into distribution systems and direction lines with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura has a criminal record against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today a criminal offence against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Sea region, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice region and the leader of the Olomouc region, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the effort of the company to carry out regional transport in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders approach us and say that we take the roses out, so we have only expanded the offer on the scale, as it was agreed with them.
They claimed that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
There's nothing else we can do to resist.
Because of this deterioration of the Society's Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he had evidence from all regions that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the collection of punishments for the further continuation of the media show of Jancura, which serves him as free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my good names and the good reputation of my area, and I also ask for more leaders.
I take it that in this case it will also be made clear that Jancura is the one who manipulates the public in the case of regional road transport and uses false and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura has already reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in the advertising, which will be shown on the next step in the region.
He told the radio station that he'd report the campaign after Christmas, and he'd like to continue after New Year.
He pointed out that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura, after the region agreed on the operation of the regional train with the Czech railway and had not issued a statement for the mission of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the traffic in the areas, Jancura said he was already a member of the CSSD.
The only smoke was if we didn't forget that we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, today Jancura told the radio journal.
Infection against pneumonia free and voluntary
Immunization against pneumonia changes the habit since January.
It should be free and free for the families first.
But now, votes have been announced that the commitment will be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals are completed.
The Institute of Medicine has already determined the maximum rates of vaccines to be paid for the disease insurance.
The professionals are also clear about the reception procedure.
New Impfung
Infants free of charge for August children
From January, children can be subjected free to pneumonia, which was born on and after 2 August last year.
The condition is that they have not yet received an infusion dose.
Anyone who has started with the imppension in recent years or earlier must also pay for further recovery.
The first infusion dose must be given between 3 and 5 months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had adopted their children against pneumonia.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the implanting of the youngest children.
On the other hand, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the Imppen doses of 300,000 to 450,000 krones per year.
However, they will save the treatment that the children would need without interference.
To date, the state has issued approximately 500,000 per year for all the area adoptions of the children.
The obligation was introduced with the so-called Janata package.
Pneumococcal disorders cause mellitus, but also severe infections, including brain haemorrhage and blood loss.
Pneumocokine infections cause death in children up to 28 years of age and up to 10 years of age, following a study in hospitals.
In addition to Chechiens, the obligation of the children against pneumonia was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the impinging be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this imppension could be a future obligation.
As of January, this should be paid by the insurance and be voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahlas Civil Association, Rudolf Kalovsky, said that it would be better to assume the obligation.
Its association is already long-term for the pneumocoke infection.
The experts at the International Conference, which was part of our association, were not very pleased that we had voluntary immunization.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have achieved at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the anti-pneumatic procedure.
At this point we will not consider this at all, his speaker Vlastimil Sesen said.
The voluntary imppension has its parts, accused the doctors.
The president of the company of practical child doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, suggests that voluntary immunization has its disadvantages.
If all children were infected, then you could think of the reduction in the number of relapses "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this infection has been launched as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to take their babies against pneumonia in the next year.
The imppension against pneumocoke is also disturbing that this is paid as the first area injection of disease insurance and not from the state.
The insurance should issue the money for the prevention so that they can save for further treatment, Cabnochova says.
The doctors must buy the vaccine themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical child medicines that concern the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original purpose, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then obtained by doctors on the same route as other vaccines issued to them by the State.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance would "be able to make money out of sickness insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccine themselves and wait until the insurance is paid to them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroners per month, which is a significant sum.
That's not going to be easy, Cabrnochova says.
U.S. Artist's son to "Museum Diebstah"
The son of the famous American Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was placed in his car with a trailer when loading 90 images.
It's called Frank Frazetta young and another man had used a baker to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his performance of such artists as Conan of Barbara and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
The AP quoted an anonymous police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could be motivated by a family knife.
The Agency reported that, according to a police statement, Frazetta Junior claimed, he was shown by his father "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all the images into storage".
The Agency informed Frank Frazetta Senior that he was struggling to grant any permission.
Labour protects tax and tax increases
The Ministers have identified the tax increases and expenditure ceilings mentioned in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to "distribute" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by making decisions until after the election.
The treasurer is also pleased to note that he targeted workers with low and medium income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security and a 1 per cent cut-off limit of public loans for 2011.
Social insurance
The trade unions have protested, however, that low-glossers are being punished for a resistance they have not caused and warned of previous "problems".
The accession of social insurance - on approximately 3 billion British funds per year - has provoked the private economy, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the emphasis should be on economic growth.
The increase that is limited to those worth more than $20,000 per year is about 10 million workers.
PACKAGE LEAFLET
Increase in social security by 0.5 % from April 2011
In this year's economy is more than 4.75% expected
New 50 % rate on bankers bonus
1 Percentage increase in body tax for small companies
Tax charges for electric vehicles and wind turbines
State interest increase by 2,5 %
According to the estimate of the damage collection, one will be worse with an annual income of $30,000 per year to $90 per year and one with $40,000 per year will be less than 190, while one person with $10,000 per year will be richer than 110.
The ministers said that their goal of deficit treatment by 2013 meant "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would fall to the 5% of top valuers.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the skimmed tax increases and expenditure ceilings are "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit, and this is also necessary over the next four years," he shared with the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The proposals of the Labour Party on the future economic growth – with the impact on the extent of the debt and the speed of the deficit – were asked after the damages were forced to be revised.
In his opinion, the economy is likely to drop by 4,75% this year - more than the decrease of 3,5% predicted in April – while the debt would be higher than before.
"A custom opportunity"
Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the labor debt crisis said the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to propose a credible plan as to how they will repay this and press "synically" before difficult decisions until after the election – the most recent need to take place in June 2010.
"They haven't said anything about what they're going to do," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this and they had to let them go."
"The significant announcements will be made only after the election, who will always win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The work requires that schools, hospitals and the police be preserved before future cuts, other than in the proposals of conservatives, which will see the deficits faster and faster.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money that will be earned by tax increases and spending stops will be used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "building on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that some at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment in some invalids in April next April - would replace the shadow channel to the front of the vote, as the money could only be returned in the next year.
Labor needs to provide extra assistance if people need it at the most and that the situation will be reassessed in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the Minister has not given details of state over 2011, economists say that the press on public expenditure will only be brought to trial in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Taxation Research said that the figures of the Schatzcanzler would mean strong cuts in many areas, perhaps in future, also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only damages pain later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will be made only after the election, who will always win them," added Roger Bottle, economic consultant at the company's audit.
"This was just the great preab report, the markets recognized it."
FBI research "Citizens of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five notified US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were taken to a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, where they shared the American message in Pakistan from the BBC.
The FBI said it will be examined whether the same men were reported missing last month in the U.S. federal state of Virginia.
The US Foreign Ministry said they were also looking for information about men.
Three of them are intended to be Pakistani descent, one is an Egyptian origin, and the other has an Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are very interested in the points of complaint that will be brought against them and under what circumstances they will be held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work together with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay, if it really is the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani message in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the domestic police had already been interested in the house before and that no charges were filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the findings, but she said that the United States must "co-operate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in order to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by your families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty sentenced "Missbrunche" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "Missuse Pattern" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections in June.
A man who was quoted in the report said he was shot and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has shown early criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After President Mahmud Ahmadined's election, thousands of people were arrested and killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Thousands of convicted prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protest of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the abuse claims acknowledged and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak power plant.
But since then there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Status"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old IT student Ibrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of working with Facebook networks and the protest against election results.
"They beat me open in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false statement and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, sharing Amnesty with him.
The alleged presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities lied to the premise of rape, but indicated that there had been a failure.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a concentration camp in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the disturbances after the election and the government's reactions, but so Amnesty, the mandate and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 persons were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to convert a sign in Bristol into a battleship.
The shipyards of this park held 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders fighting for money prices.
On the tip of the hangs in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump shot at the beginning of a 100-metre long hangs.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view of the hip of the neck, but it was also quite beautiful.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city that are below the glaciers.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were paid for the best pieces of art that were performed on the wall - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Switzerland's electors voted for a ban on mining and increased concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, a well-founded and well-founded report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the clearest secularised societies in Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book with admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French don't love headphones" (2006), an elegant and well-informed study of a street question that has been shared and employed by the country over half a century and is still going to take effect today.
Bowens' new book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but also what really happens in the area.
He spent months in Moscow, schools and institutions, which now deliver between 5 and 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Free Spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives discussions between teachers and students about the questions that most of them question.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a rataus (or both)?
Should young Muslims learn about Evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it lawful for a Muslim to use a sensory banking system to get a mortgage?
These seemingly simple matters, he claims to be the way out of daily life, in contrast with the political dramas that deal with the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of which is known with a name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim teacher and academic in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and on the other hand a good citizen of a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are misdirective to the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are most at least at the expense of their salafi gangs – the founder of the Purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – today shows a small but influential presence under European Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention calls for both sides to give and take.
He asks whether the French political decision-makers (and intellectual elites, who are so passionate about the separation of the Church and State) really feel obliged to feel pluralism.
He points out that Muslims may experience a harsh treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, on the other hand, had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He also recognizes the "increasing of values" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, it is easy to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most reliable view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that marks it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have engaged in the renewal of open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their source water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the north, the icebar.
Living in the complicated history and politics of the Walfangs, he describes the long tradition of architects who have proved themselves on the icebars when hunting.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bar as a 14-year-old fênrich to the sea, who only fought with his musket ball, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were arrested, when they dropped their recently killed mothers behind their bodies, were brought to Zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 icebars in a presentation.
Even today, zoo facilities still have a millionth of the life area of a wild elderly person. The climate is rare: the icebrow in Singapore has been quite green by the algae growing in the tall hair of its hair.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by the hunters for the survival of the species.
Despite the ban in Norway, America and Russia, the legacy continues in Greenland and Canada, where soldiers in helicopters and motorbike trainers use powerful storms to carry their homes to the streets.
Ironically, in the waters north of these two hunting nations the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and encouraging description of the science of the Arctic and a comprehensive insight into how the future could develop.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can accurately explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not a lack of explanation.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries allowed for the first time to produce the translation of the package.
Undersea boats in the cold war are the different degrees of sub-training.
A useful addition is satellite measurements and the large-scale delivery of Messsondens to Eisbergen, but there is still much to be achieved by unstoppable people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the own, windy world of the flow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater inhalers, which are combined in cooling.
But, starting from the snow on the ice to the microscopic small wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer season begins, which is counted between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... it could be us."
Marine mothers were among the 6,000 who were down in Arlington Krenze
The super-free De'Angello Robinson travels seven hours by bus to put a single bow on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other seafarers who took the journey from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peace Court in Arlington to dress graffiti, the day was a trip to the men and women in which they were sitting.
In a few months, where we were always brought back, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered in the morning to lay boundaries on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Peace Hall.
Morrisl Worcester, owner of the Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition when he and some others decided to decoy several hundred graves at the Peace Hall in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morris and his wife, Karen, who travel this trip every year, in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also established a joint organization, Wreaths Cross America (Creation in All America), which has also extended the event to other countries.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 borders on the Gröbers at the Arlington Freehouse, in the area of the Pentagon, on the Gräffs of the Fayetteville National Freehouse in Arkansas, on the Battery Park in New York, and on the United Airlines Airport 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent over $150,000 a second time for the purchase and transport of the border.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she had taken the trip to Arlington in mind to her husband, a dead professional.
Although her husband is not finished in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back something that the victims brought.
She said that is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family farm.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked around the scattered grasslands and hills of the peaceful.
The volunteers had older diggers from the 1st and 2nd world war and the Vietnam War as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer diggers are, so are the organizers.
The vote was happy, children played, and couples held their hands, while they carried the fresh Kifernnwigs to the grey gravestones.
Each round root was dark green with a small red layer that was attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is close to and where mainly veterans of the war are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remains very quiet.
The United Service organizations spent 1,000 borders to beautiful this section, but the destitution of the current war filled this area.
Individual whites were open, other priests and families and friends held themselves in the necessary air.
Some of the names mentioned in the stone appear, while others go down to small black-white squares, which were hidden in the thick sludges, whose gravestones have not yet been made.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who lost their son's legs before the funeral.
It is 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyards of Marine Infrared Infrared U.S. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm not anymore, I want someone to remember him."
Recruitment of the US Government of Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has a contractor from the U.S. government, mobile phone and notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor who has not yet been identified is working for Development Alternatives Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US government for international development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the United States of America's interest in Havanna are trying to get access to the prison, which was held on 5 December.
The special complaint points have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the charge of the "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including simple protests and critical letters, pose a risk of arrest.
Government opponents' graphics and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing Blogger community, which is inspired by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who describes more clearly how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly sought permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist government of the Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "long" approach to improving relations on the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported on Friday by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy puts the United States to a standstill when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average government service is $15 per month.
Since this year, the Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, they will be used mainly for sending text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day's wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government stations, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names.
For many websites, access is restricted.
The arrest of an American is rare in Cuba.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba who are in prison are sitting behind bars because of crimes such as drug abuse, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US interest in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on the arrest.
The arrests and the gates are clearly false.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the commission of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said José Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", which replaced Raul Castro as leader of the country that replaced the sick brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would be arrested, tried and arrested very often within a day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving together for more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hoped that this could help to detect an extensive network of terrorists looking for the Internet for radicalized young men.
They said that they were looking for an indistinct opposition known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he found out because one of them had commented on terrorism on YouTube's Internet video site.
Saifullah was visited in Pakistan by the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's native village, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah, the Al-Qaida leaders could not convince themselves that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of Sargotha, far away from the uninterrupted mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covered operation.
That is why they were dismissed, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and kept trying to obtain the right recommendations to access Al-Qaida camps when they were taken by the Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of the players in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in the decision on who is confident.
Since the accession of 11 September 2001, it has made the U.S. secret service a matter of great urgency to deliver human assets within Al-Qaida.
The participants of the organization act as passports, who do not reintroduced those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and such can be spyies.
American Power Recruiters will be subjected by A Kaida to a special test, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda values, they are also considered to be unremembered attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the leading analyst of the NEFA Foundation with a seat in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years in order to allow them access, as U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to lock someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Ten thousand demonstrators demand in Copenhagen Climate Action
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here on the streets on Saturday and asked the dealers at the Bella Congress Center of the city to do more to deal with climate protection.
Democrats said that 100,000 people had joined the event, although the police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists broke down small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city.
On a day when climate negotiations promoted by the UN, thousands of activists with transparency across the city, on which there was "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars concluded the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, make you aware of the heartrending problems the country has to deal with because of the already devastating effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - to continue to appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way out.
The police stopped the demonstrators from arriving near the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the fact that they were either masked or carrying bags.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in the event of demonstrations.
According to a visitor who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black dress wore several bodies of explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, where there are several ministers.
They kept them near the building, he said and added that they started as lights, but then were followed by "a few large explosions".
In the conference center, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to have reached the awareness of the chief executives, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate dealer.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he said in English, "That's something I never knew."
Then he went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the event is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He found that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and different sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they destroy the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Show test data of a heart attack
The testimony to mathematics last week was welcome news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country's schools, the highest performances show evidence that the four- and eight-year-olds have made faster progress than the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York in the past two years.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), is the hard work force between African and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average number of white white square clasps from Washington D.C. has increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which has only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-year-old was based on the same point, which reached a statistically reliable point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data as the sample was not large enough.
The picture of a six-year period is also not encouraging.
When the first NAEP was discovered in this district, the white and black square clasp was separated from 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that the children have achieved in both groups has grown in this period, the difference with 58 points has not been reduced yet.
Some of the teachers in the district last week expressed their concern that the results that were celebrated by Schulkanzlerin Michele A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were preceded by the majority of white students who are already highly skilled children.
This shows that we have raised the overall value of the treatment of those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of D.C. Voice, a joint group that is involved in the equality of education in Washington D.C.
I don't jump for a span of two or three points up and down, said the democratic Washington City Treaty Member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Basic School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test points is that the city's secondary schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what's bothering me is that we don't have to use the time and energy we have to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the disabled students.
For example, some teachers are asked to use a new learning plan, the Wilson-Less system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which did not master the fundamental skills of reading at the beginning of their school course, and which is significantly behind their simultaneous classrooms.
Daily mathematics, a learning plan, which is based on children's games and live experiences from the sixth grade, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Jane and some of the NEP progress reported last week will be written.
I believe that we must continue to work to allow the best measures to reach the students, which are below the level of note, said Rhee.
Others say that the NEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and resources for the weak schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, researched the results of urban research.
The conventional remedy is to address its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The aim could be to call for political effects to work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is of course, as in other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black medium.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the cities so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance club is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the Charter Schools.
It is necessary to increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, Janey, who, with his teaching work last year, came to an agreement over 185 days per year, which he considered "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than for the future
The trip bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a low pfeffen.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises up and shines a moment in view of the white salts, the steel fibers and the sweet green rose.
Gracielas parents have almost finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and those of the other eight-year-olds of the group who studied the Gettysburg, where the education cost $38,690 per year, were the first to be the most feared visitor than that of an enthusiast student.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" called Graciela, who wanted to study medicine when the leader announced that she was now attending the building for sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said sadly when she was told the low-level professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The school in Pennsylvania was the 7th which the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken the message fully: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who do not end up in high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is necessary to grow in the media.
In fact, one of the five of these "second generation" of Spanish Americans concludes the college – which is a remarkable performance since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having finished high school.
Their success stories are important, says researchers, because for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's labour force, it will show the way forward.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural disability for the school and an incentive for them to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of trust with American schools.
But consultancy programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you consider children who do not have their parents' experience and skills to help them when searching through the system, a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Spanish students.
We need to consider providing these children with a supportive network from the pre-school to the high school.
The federal program, financed by Gracielas College Tour, is an important example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a go up - and sets more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college training programs that begin when successful students are in high school and continue to run until they have finished high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, more than 60% of whom have attended college since 1999.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the suspicion of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to restore its damaged infrastructure in two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been affected by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were able to sell only parts of two of the 10 expanded fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for their participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has issued a ban has brought the cuts.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields expanded in June.
The late representatives of the American oil mills were surprised by the opening of the Iraqi oil industry.
Finally, after six years of war, Iraq opened its doors and instead of US companies to Asian and European companies, Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which have been submerged by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military have probably prevented American oil companies from doing so, said analysts to engage more strongly in Iraq, which has the world's largest raw oil reserves.
In some cases, U.S. companies were advantageous because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, had significantly lower wage costs and increased risks because they did not have to enable shareholders to account.
Exxon mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
More U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and with the Technical Council in recent years, have been free of charge.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main producers in two of the contracts agreed this week.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go to home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the speaker of the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, said that China is on the way to become one of the world's largest economies and a technology.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its partners and meet its obligations against Iraq.
In the case of the pre-debt companies, tenders were made, which were then compared with the fee per Barrel oil, which the ministry was willing to pay to increase the cost of each field beyond the current level.
Al Kaida's top planner openly killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US rocket attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan this week, an Al-Qaida top-implementary planner was to be killed, as reported by U.S. terrorist attacks on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second fatal attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this brain.
Salah al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, were to be killed by a number of rockets that hit her vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of north-west Virginia.
Foreign authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a type of smoke used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal sphere.
They were in a white car towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civil secret service from Miran Shah per telephone said.
Locals who are in the suspect to belong to the millionaires went to the place and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely damaged bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. terrorist attacks provided uncertain evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al-Qaida, leading operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in complaints all over the world, noticed a leading officer who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the high character of US air strikes on Pakistani soils.
If you take your central role as a gift, this also included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Kaida's top leaders and put them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said Somalia was rapidly in Al-Qaida hierarchy and had better links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known by some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not reduce the risk he posed for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of Al Kaida or Taliban, who has been killed since September, as in a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribal area and three other topists.
The time of the attack by the CIA is since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website contained by a joint organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The withdrawal may depend on improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to reduce their aggressiveness and, at the same time, kill the suspects, the site reported.
Head of UN Ambassadors in Kabul will return
The leading message of UNO in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would be returned from his office in March, thereby ending a turbulent office time, which would have been executed by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by UNO.
This is a step forward when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Ambassador said he supported the increase in troops, but he also stressed his concern that the US military return plan, which would start in 18 months, could allow other NATO governments to withdraw their war forces.
We need to speed up the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian aid to help in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lower his office, but only one of his family met an agreement in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the message to UNO.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now proceed to provide time for a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a follower, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between the passage of my predecessors and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he took into account the Swedish-Italian-Shammer Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously conducted UN peace operations.
The position in Afghanistan was put to the test after Peter W. Galbraith, former representative of Afghanistan, had accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai's election in the country and exchanging evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has brought back all charges, but he also said that the charges of Galbraith - which were burned - "have undoubtedly added damage to the mission, because there is already a great extent to the scheme in relation to international inclusion in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the support measures of the American-led combat forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed that the United Nations leadership would allow its successor to appoint more staff from the United States and other Western countries to spend for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen her confidence that her money would be used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the relevant United Nations arrangements had undermined his ability to bring back the people.
The UN rules are designed so that I have been able to set up only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster and can't go on like this.
US Minister of Defence Gates: Iran has to calculate additional sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world power will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in talks about his atomic plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in Northern Iraq and took the view of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options for choosing, he said in response to a soldier's question of the probability of such development.
"One of the things that is on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that the war has its own incomprehensibility."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the media.
He said that a "package of positive and negative reasons" is necessary, "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons", because "his people are not aware" will be subjected to sanctions.
On Friday, Robert Gibbs, a White House speaker, warned the American government that the European top policy makers should be aware of the consequences of the "trusted" consequences if they do not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to limit its atomic programme and would abandon its spare parts to a significant part of its storage stocks in the exchange of essential nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US Government has put pressure on this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Since then, however, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreement -- in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership is unique to whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community with regard to some of the proposals that it had already agreed on in early October has made it clear that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has not been brought together in such a way as it was in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st anniversary for Iran to respond to these proposals before other options, including those declared by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "expressive sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representative of the United Nations has condemned what he called on a Security Council member on Thursday "relevant and unfounded claims" and said that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, which should be returned to Washington on the last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he met with the soldiers in church and with Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially with regard to borders, property rights and because of the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in US plans, to reduce the American troops' strength by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to suppress the Kurdish concern about the leading troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who called Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, said: "We will receive your security, welfare and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Course in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, who thought that "Mother Earth is too tired to keep more children" and "A baby more means a grave".
These lessons have taught them so well that as government officials in Shanghai, which began suddenly by the low birth rate and the elderly population in this summer, to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than a child, their answer was immediate and final: "No matter."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, Wang said, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the Single Child Policy in China, two generations of notorious, abandoned single children, who have been lovingly called "small emperors", is facing a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy is in force, the UNO says:
The population distribution is determined, while the number of population groups from 60 years of age and older in 2020 is about 16.7 per cent of the population to 31.1 per cent of the year 2050. This is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in many coastal cities with educated people, such as Shanghai.
Last year nearly 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai have grown up in 60 years and older, while the birth rate is below a child per pair.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in witnessing age babies need to "help to reduce the ratio of older populations and reduce the labour shortages of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old as -- but not as rich -- as the industrial countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step back
In the 1978 Constitution of the country, China should be the most controversial policy that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who are aware of these policies must be able to afford huge amounts of money -- up to their three-year term in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese State representatives have written this policy that the critical claim of natural land resources could be avoided, which has condemned human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural regions, some officials have been forced to expel pregnant women who have already had a child.
In addition, many couples had been able to perform sexual selective operations, resulting in a sudden high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude toward child politics.
They have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including citizens, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been single children -- and the tone of many hearts in 2007.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children, where a partner is a single child.
Shanghai was born in July to the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Plakats, which taught families to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that described in detail who is asking for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent civil servants and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and pass information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Absorption
Although officials from a rural small town in the outlying areas of Shanghai said that a awakening is to be recognised at the request of couples who, after the start of the campaign, want a second child who does not want to report any change to the urban areas.
In the Huinan municipality with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five apply per month.
The estimated number of births in the city for 2010 despite the campaign will still be around 165,000 -- something higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, director of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee, Caolu said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that is also legally allowed.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West view the single-child policy as a question of human rights, Yang, a builder whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, you're taking the opportunity to have more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their tears.
Wang, the staff leader, said that she only wanted a child because she was a single child. "We were the middle of the family and used to say that everyone felt about us.
We are not used to caring for others and do not want this to happen."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it was amazing.
For parents from the middle class with double careers, the birth rate, he said, it turns out to be successful and it has to be self-sustained.
The age group of today's 20-39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they want such a life never for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, puts enormous demands at the time of parents.
A mother must give her social life at least for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "I have to build his apartment" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to prepare a life course for the best courses."
Most of his friends are ready to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group develops emission reduction plan
The UN climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild positions and mutual charges -- has again focused on the release of a document on Friday, which, for the next 40 years, marked a fair reduction in greenhouse gas, where industries in the near future have to pay the greatest debts.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the management of greenhouse gases has identified the remaining obstacles as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that takes time, since the next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will be arriving in Copenhagen.
The text formulated by a UN working group formed for its own purpose moves beyond the amount of money that many countries should give to poor countries in order to increase global warming in short and long term.
It also offers a palette of options for key questions, including how industrial and large-scale coal countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the global temperature level should be.
The process will be very flexible, as John Coequyt, the leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-six-six-six-page document, compiled a 180-page negotiating text to put it in the middle of what the leading UNO climate protection representative Yvo de Boer referred to as "the big deal".
It shows the fundamentality of a possible agreement in which industries, together with their emissions by 2020, would reduce by 25 to 45 per cent, compared with the 1990 thresholds, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent at the same time.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Community has also delivered talks on Friday, with its assurance that over the next three years it will provide $3.6 billion a year to support more countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of overcrowdings and doors to the prevention of deforestation.
The Friday, however, brought together the same white fireworks that had determined the conversations in the last week.
The American air-conditioned Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger coastal countries, if these are not financed by industry.
This train announced that the Obama government would run a tougher line with China, not even two years ago, as a representative of the Bush government.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the existence of larger candidate countries and taking measures, such as stars, who also claimed that the text would not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern expressed his opinion one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister He Yafei's statement, which claimed that the leading American climate dealer was either "the reason" or "the most irresponsible" by him at the beginning of the week that he said that the United States would not help financially to increase global warming.
Because the future economic orientation of the great world powers is at stake, both within the industries and between the industries and the coastal countries have emerged from the thresholds.
The current struggle is similar to the saving of individual economies, as well as the saving of the planet, where China and the United States are bound by their respective obligations, while developing countries claimed that the two thousand most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers should fight for those who should bear the costs of breaking up the greenhouse gas tank, even though the countries concerned have gone too far to take the countries with very high greenhouse gas charges for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic governance is being developed, such as Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most strongly opposed to the effects of climate change have said that they would continue to fight a legally binding contract in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said that the talks would be conducted in the best case to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the Offensive of the small island states is "political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now united and demand measures from the coastal countries, such as China and India.
The talks brought new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open issues had to be clarified even before the arrival of the Heads of State in order to reach agreement.
High-level representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Ministers, set up their aircraft and raced through the streets of the Bella-Centre to meet behind closed doors and press conferences to mark the climas that will be dealt with in the next week.
The pure size of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to the conference centre every day and go out, guitar-played activists, showing their pride over the countries that have been disappointed and sold their opinion, and contracts will be hand-in-hand instead of e-mailed, already present a challenge.
The intensity is based only on: almost all the important ministers are here now and from midnight, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the Organization's Global Policy Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
The UK's first 225 km/h speed train defines the mountain feeling new
At 5 a.m. in the morning, a pfee will be forced into darkness to announce an access journey that represents a revolution in the UK.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach London St. Pancras 225 km/h at the time of its departure from Ashfort, Kent, and will be 93 km back in 38 minutes.
Then, to Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javelin Pendler Service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will finally connect to an international rail network faster and more reliable trains and connect the major bathing areas of the Middle East, North and Scotland to London.
The delayed province could become viable pendants, reduce working hours radically, and reduce the change in aircraft and car to the rail would reduce national carbon emissions and noise on the streets.
In theory, the three great parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British funds needed to build a new national rail network, which could still draw the brakes at the British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January, which is supposed to provide the government with a feasibility study, will be delivered by Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed track map of the next level of the high-speed network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will take place with a five-metre play area in urban areas and places where the effects on the environment are at stake.
In the free zone, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 should also create three options for a larger, north-east leading high speed network.
Lord Adonis will react in the morning.
The proposed option is an Y-premier route that would lead to a single high speed route in the West Midlands.
The route would be divided into or near Birmingham and would lead to Manchester and Scotland in the west, and another in the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle up to Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functional option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced by 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part line that would not be opened before 2025 would allow travelers to return to London-Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with today's one hour.
The design would give trainers the opportunity to travel at 400 km/h with a speed of 400 km/h, which would make the British rail network the fastest European.
The first section was designed to enable 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains could be operating per hour on the London-Birmingham street.
This would also mean that an end station would be needed in London, which could be carried out at 20,000 passengers per hour.
In view of the spatial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing train station will be built to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will be informed whether this plan should continue to be implemented or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains had to be switched from the high speed routes to existing ski routes in north of Birmingham, which would continue to be between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This applies as a decisive point of departure to ensure that a change from the aircraft to the train can be ensured, a measure for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come for mortgages for 75,000 pounds of a conservative to
Alan Duncan, the leading conservatory member, has taken into account the tax payer per year thousands of pounds for the costs of an orange that he has built in his home in his selection circle.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he claimed that underhouse members had to live “from magic reasonings”, has raised his mortgage of 75,000 pounds to allow himself to build an ekewood factory at his second house in Rutland.
He was able to take into account the additional interest income of the taxpayer, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The underhouse officials accepted the applications at the time, and they were also questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the underhouse members. On the last night, Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest tenants, owns a two-storey house in a village in his choice circle of Rutland and Melton.
In nearby houses, a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros) has been reached.
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fee Office, an outlet in the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden that is called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors describe him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges during a brief examination of his previous mortgage contracts.
The Committee has released it in the last month following an examination of its expenditure on the application of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a mortgage over 271,406 pounds (EUR 300,000) from his London house to his election house, which he had purchased a year before he was elected a member of Parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan was able to recover from mortgages by around 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month in the last year until March.
In April, its claims amounted to more than EUR 1,800 (1,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS-hypothec has not changed during this time, which indicates that the total increase in the financing of the sum of EUR 75,000 (€ 55,000).
The normal non-student RBS hypothe kinetics fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March of this year, where it is still present.
The latest documents published in the house show that Duncan continued to apply for $1,250 (EUR 1,400) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader in the basement in September, after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the release channel that parliamentarians would live "from great reason".
"In essence, it means that when you work for the state, you have to live by wise reasoning and are treated as S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and have raised claims on a missing part, measuring what is in it.
And I could have asked for all the fucking sums, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as oil dealer, was first arrested in May for his expenses, as it was clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had declared with the Fee Office that this could be considered "as a surplus requirement".
An activist, as a Protestant in Duncan's Rasen, has graved a hole in the form of a pedophile, after it became known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was asked about the elevated mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fee Office and the following Legg for the increase."
He added: "There is no debate on gaps and delays or a prohibition of rules or similarities.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, it is approved and everything.
It couldn't even be cleaner and clearer."
All of your fellow believers come to admire Brighton's beach cottage adventure calendar
Beach hotels in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group, which is based on spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decoy their homes for every December day with Christmas leaders as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were able to visit the latest hotels every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at a free gliwhein and traditional Mince Pies, with dry fruits filled with bags.
The selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hotel decoration here is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an excellent spiritist of the Chichester Diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people as a church to come to a rare old building? I think the church should go to people and conduct exciting festivals.
The idea of the beachhotel Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during the evenings.
Brighton is such a great creative and living place and we try to express it through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and Copenhagen on Saturday to ask for an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people call the police, hundreds of thousands say the organizers, are in the colds of the Danish capital, at the end of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could take effect from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, increasing mobilization in the world contributes to what these demonstrations demonstrate is that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The differences in the Danish capital soon occurred after the train was over, as a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, covered windows with plaststones and walls, established a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unsanitary police have been arrested immediately and without a back-up.
The police have reported that between 600 and 700 people, according to your estimate, are mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, of these extremely violent sectarian groups that have already been established in Nato Summit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has adopted the conditions under which hundreds of military allies were "without distinction", critically criticised, and has stressed that about a hundred of you "were still in the streets on Saturday evening" despite extreme colds with handshakes and instations.
The more peaceful train has been carried out by Parliament towards the Bella Center, where negotiations have taken place.
The demonstrators have kept about 500 meters away from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to allow the expected speakers to arrive at the evening with a candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Bishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators are angry with bugs and trains from major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, as well as some Africans, were present.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue skyscrapers, have made a first start in Copenhagen in the morning, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to form "Blue weather" for the "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to ask for restoration of the ecological debt for the sake of the south , Lidy Nacpil, a Philippinesian activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on and tell us about this: we have time, I mean Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that can provide waterways, just as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has joined the environmental organisations.
European Commissioner José Bové, designed by the Globalisation Critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where there are many islands that are particularly threatened by warming, has given the start-up committee for demonstrations.
About 50,000 people were on the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila there were hundreds of people, most of the students who are in Rot and have hit Bandanas, in which you inherited solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, as well as in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators found their way to demand an energy approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have collected hundreds of people, namely in Paris, in Marseilles (South), in Lille (Northern), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
In Geneva some people have gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia has chosen its presidents, Georgia stated that it is dealing with a "stairy" here.
Abkhazia has chosen its presidents on Saturday, which took place more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist geographical area as itself, Tbilisi declared the "Stretch".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgia War of August 2008 for the control of the South Ossetian region, another Georgian sessionist area, recognised by Russia.
The elections have closed at 17 hours of GMT.
The electoral contribution amounted to about 58 % in the hours before the election closure, according to the polling committee responsible.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former President, Sergei Bagapch, are categorically discussing the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These choices are a step forward.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Michel Saakachvili, advised that Abkhazia is now under a Russian death sentence, explained his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaldze.
In addition to Russia, Nicaragua and Venezuela have only recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world is part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, where thousands of people died, Abkhazia would like to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, a new era, as a independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Lord Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who chose to choose a choice in an election hall, which was located in a school in Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with some palm trees before entering.
The question of Russian Dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes in the Black Sea.
Large figures on which Bagapch is to be seen on the side of the Russian President and Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are found everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he has said at a small party, as a reflection of the support of Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision of Abkhazia itself.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a voice of Wodka.
The opposition, which was represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements with Moscow last year, such as those in Abkhazia Russia, which have left the control of the rails for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the present government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit value, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos World Wide, Infringements in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated around the world on Saturday to ask for an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to use about 700 people, have established an important demonstration.
Three thousand people said police, hundreds of thousands said that the organizers had demonstrated in the afternoons in the Danish capital, which received delegates from 193 countries to seek an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament welcomed the peaceful train towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were held.
The demonstrators have kept about 500 metres from the center and have not tried to interfere.
A stage was built to allow the expected speakers to arrive for a night with a candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Bishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train was over, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and were armed with backstones and with hammers, began to insert ships, established a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unsustained police officers have immediately invaded you and have entered without a back-up by shooting some of you on the ground.
The police reported that 600 to 700 people were arrested and explained that it was mainly about members of the Blacks Blocks, these extremely violent sectarian groups that were already famous for Nato Summit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer was arrested in the middle of the incident, which called the police, about twenty people were arrested in advance. Four vehicles burned near a house.
"We have the extreme groups in the Griff," explained the police speaker Henrik Jacobsen, while the hijackers of the order forces were operating in the air.
Most demonstrators who stopped by train or with their own vehicle from Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue rain forest, turned to a first group in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of "Friends of the Earth" to represent the "Blue Sea" for "climate justice".
"Today we go on the road to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the south," said Activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say again : We still have time," says the singer Angelique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers, there are waterways that can run through what never happened before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was called by the 1992 adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of Globalisation Anti-Frauders has joined the environmental protection organizations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalisation Critic José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christiansensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian- pacific space in which many islands are especially vulnerable to earthquakes has given rise to demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went on the street according to the words of the organizers.
In Manila, hundreds of people, in many students, dressed red with Bandanas before the city administration of the Philippines’s capital for solar energy advertising.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people, in particular Paris, Marseilles in the south, Little in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east, were held together during the demonstrations organized by the network of 350.
In Geneva, several people gathered.
The facher geography and history go according to Chatel, strengthened by the reform of the Lycées.
The National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview that in the Sunday journal "Journal du Dimanche" it appeared that the faechers performed geography and history strengthened by the reform of the Lycées, even though they are not required to be taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have all four hours and the same program," said Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "we must overcome this hypocrisy", for he says "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in large and large areas a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) cannot be a sub-profile of science," he continued. He continued: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been involved in the lack of historical and geographical education in the terminal on technical sciences."
On Saturday, IFP asked about seven out of ten francs (69%) to criticise the state project of the chain of compulsory education in history and geography in the S Terminal S (12 year of school with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also rejected this project, as well as the links and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied that there was no question regarding a restriction on the philosophy of the S Terminal Programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a protest against the project, which they considered to be a victim of after the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister pointed out that at the beginning of the year, the Master 2 (M2) was subject to a professional qualification examination and at the end of the year an authorisation examination of their qualifications.
In addition, they conduct practice during the year in M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in practice.
He further said: "If you add all the practice offered before the performance test, you will reach more than 300 hours that you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister explained that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "something that does not exist in the education of the people."
He repeatedly confirmed that he wanted to create the school map "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Superior"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use on the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to deal with in Paris on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Superior in Rue d'Ulm.
As a journalist of the AFP, peacekeeper Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts are using filmed contributions to the public every fifteen minutes.
You want to know more about what people get and how they feel, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years of age and one of the organizers of this day, at the end of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names the students gave the fish in the school base.
"Of the experts, twenty discussion participants were chosen, even after their charisma," he said.
"You can speak for hours with climate warming, but the core targets can also be displayed in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of Folien.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in his hope that the audience would agree that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific file."
The videos driven by these conferences will be available online from December 15 on the side of the school.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will be held every two months.
Payment delay : valid prison terms, planned actions
On Friday, the trade unions of the criminal service officers called for a general day of action in order to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid from budgetary sources until January are transferred before Christmas.
The 2nd Association of Criminal Appeals Officers ("FO-Penitentiaire") called on the staff who had no service to demonstrate tomorrow before the Criminal Court and to block them in order to pay attention to the "dief of what belongs to them".
The 3rd Association of Criminal Appeals Officers ("CGT-Penitentiaire") called on "to agree to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the hours, nights and holidays in October was burned as "fast and unacceptable" in December.
The first trade union of criminal officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Prison (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and jealousy."
The management of the criminal justice system and the Ministry of Justice stated that the hours spent in 2009 were very busy and not all of them were in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining demands will be paid in January.
As told by the Ministry of Justice at night, Michele Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the officials of the criminal service, in which he is assured that the payment will take place in the next month.
"I know very well that the efforts of the staff to keep and modernise our criminal justice system are effective," the Minister of Justice shares in this letter.
"I have indicated the direction of the criminal action plan to take irrevocably measures to prevent such a situation, which has been caused by lack of appreciation of the hours that occur in the future," Mrs Alliot-Marie added.
The December loan therefore falls higher, except for the lead staff, who come to the benefit of higher service and target premiums, explains UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary burden" needs to be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional cooperation FO in Marseille and announces to "all assemblies and meetings" until new instructions are available.
"The staff will not go to Sundays and holidays at work if the hours of October are not yet paid in December. This applies also to their over-hours," says the FO Rhône-Alpes-Avergne.
"In a time when we are increasingly entrusted with more tasks, without the establishment of more staff, the attempt is to save ourselves to the staff's money, more than inadequate," says Bordeaux's CGT trade union.
As a result, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, as stated by the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.

Euro-2009/Curzbahn: first place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming Environment Championships, has become an international title on Thursday over its favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this battle, the last time the polyurethanes were allowed, there were only three world codes, while a true record flow was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Veraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m of the lord's seats.
A damage to Bousquet, who wanted to take over the world record at 50m freestyle, which he holds in large beaks (20.94).
At one of the two King's Distances in Swimmen, 50m-Friestile, the 28-year-old francosse was held in 20.53 C., in a final with ten skimmers at the start (usually eight are) - a premium at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not create it to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"I can believe more and more, and in the present case, I have said that if the world record is in my wealth, I will try it."
How Bousquet started almost all Swimmers in Polyurethananjugens, which have been banned since 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 in the same fight.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two world masters in the fields of this summer in Rome and the world record, at the end.
The young skimer has not been able to improve its best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77) yet he has spent himself with the second time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I haven't given you everything this time.
I knew I couldn't make a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my mission."
"Lobintsev will be a major opponent in the future," declared Beedermann.
USA : Zola record worth 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman graphics plate, calculated at the French writer Emile Zola, was valued on Thursday at 1.5 million US dollars over its value, as is the artist Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century after Christ and has always been valued with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on the "four scenes of Dionysos in a sophistic architecture decoration, surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the extension of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most to this day," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this discovery of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgesese family at home, and then it was filled with pieces for the French actor Cécile Sorel, who found it in her Parisian hotel bathroom and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Petain came to power.
The next five years are in the dark.
In the research of the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "Erebes of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresco "Rougon Macquat".
Zelayas Travel visit from Honduras to Mexico has been arranged
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the oppressed Hungarian President Manuel Zelaya to domestic land as incompatible as no longer after this led by the Portuguese government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya at night seems to indicate at the moment that the possibility of carrying out this transfer is unique, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authorities, the aircraft set up by the Mexican Government, which was caught in El Salvador for the purpose of the transfer of Mr. Zelayas, was returned to its destination.
The Putsch government wanted to require Mr. Zelaya to "thank you" and to look for him abroad for political asylum.
However, the President-in-Office of the Council urged this, as he wished to return to Mexico as a consignee, to the Head of State.
The Putsch regime "has experienced a new failure by trying to move me to my costs (...), they wanted me to think about it," said Donnerg M. Zelaya against Radio Globo, in which he has reported frequently since the beginning of the political crisis that has taken place in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and like ten years, I have my guitar here, added the wounded president who had fled two and a half months ago to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa under a contract.
The Mexican message has presented us with a petition for guidance that we cannot accept, however, because it does not contain a prayer for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Deputy Minister of the Portuguese Government, declared against the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I'm looking for no country around Asyl, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he would have underlined that he would only take over as President of the Honduran people.
The complaints about a visit by Mr. Zelayas had mobilized the supporters of the wounded president, who had responded to the Brazilian message and gathered around them, while the military had strengthened his use.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Portuguese government.
This, in his view, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had joined the Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was defeated on 28 June, on the day of his public inquiry to prepare for his re-election, against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
He returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to Brazil.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested because of the High Court, which he is charged with by the justice, then the Putsch government.
The Portuguese President, Roberto Micheletti, was able to organize a presidential election on November 29th in order to eliminate Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized in the course of the controversial election by the United States and was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelayas back to the office until the end of his term of office on January 27.

There are good news from various economic sectors, Lindsey Piegza explained by FTN Financial.
However, this remained anecdotic under the premise that the market only focuses on "half-lights", so it measured.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly determined by the figures of the US trade balance, "which is an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States fell by 7.6 % in September at $32.9 billion in October.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated with a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have been added.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in the good export, reflecting the economic growth of the major trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell from the company's study Economy.com.
In this respect, unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 applications.
However, the average value of new workers during the last four weeks was "falling at the bottom of the year", stressed Scott Marcouliler by Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market is broken.

Cuba: Hundreds of participants in power make "Women in Weiss" out
On Thursday, some hundreds of Cuban parties, together with women from political prisoners, have been set up in Havanna for the purpose of the World Law Day, and they have also set up another competition, resulting in the temporary establishment of a good tens of thousands of dissidents.
For the fourteenth "Women in Weiss", women or nearby political prisoners, were posted on the open streets of the government's party under Raul Castro, just as they were on the Fussmarsk in the center of the capital to ask for the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Saldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionists!", "He lives Fidel and Raul!" the powerful parties were scandalized against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "women in Weiss" had played in Havanna the morning, when it came to no harm or arrests.
In the port area of Vedado, a dozen dissidents were arrested, who also filed a demonstration on Thursday, in view of the International Human Rights Day, by civil police, confirmed an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the police have tried to force dissidents from the government to be forced into civilian vehicles.
The temporary arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As lawyers at the Sakharov Prizes issued by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Women in Weiss" have not accepted notice for the purpose of "Praying for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to the list of dissidents, is around 200 people, organized, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of Cuban dissidents occupied in March 2003, from which up to date 53 sit behind gates.
The Cuban authorities shall receive the regime opponents as "soldier" or "agents" in the service of the declared inheritance, the United States.
One reason is that the Cuban television about the demonstration events that took place on Thursday, between the military pro-government wars and the "controversial" report.
The Cuban party, led by a Communist Party, is regularly accused of violations of rights and freedoms by European or American NGOs, in particular freedom of opinion.
Vainsinier kills eight-year-olds with the brass and leaves 5 injured in Clicky-la-garenne
A two-metre gunman killed an eight-year-old in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Sine) and injured five other people on Friday afternoon.
According to the first statement of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker had been injured by eight-year-olds from an unknown cause or prior to an apothecary on the Boulevard Jean-Years with two months, and this, according to police records, was subject to the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was reported to be responsible for the police channel Alliance in the hospital for the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same apothecary, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, almost in the driver's room, got caught and was wounded.
The first two victims were severely injured in the hospital, where the eight-year-old died.
The other injured is in a life-threatening situation, since he has been subjected to obvious life-threatening bodies following police sources.
The pregnant woman has become accustomed to the events and should be hospitalized by a police source in the shock condition.
The armed man who appears to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police officers should also be on the street, the famous Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two other passengers, apparently randomly: a three-year-old and a four-year-old, ending with two difficulties.
The scene stayed in the dark at night.
He was armed with two Fleschers, who crossed behind the back, declared before the location of Arnaud Pressé, a representative of the Alliance of the Area of Skins-de-Seine.
A number of passengers, including young people, should have tried to send the passengers away, according to the evidence reported by the AFP.
I've seen a kernel in the tricycles with a green west.
Three young attempts to make.
They couldn't do it because the kernel was well built, Alberto reported, a basement of a nearby bar.
A Horde had fallen over him, he added, including a city police officer who had broken his arm.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city police officers, including her predecessor, tried to arrest the armed man and were tortured by mesmerized, such police statements.
The event took place in one of the main players of Clichy-la-garenne, where a number of businesses are located.
The passengers came to me to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man lying on the ground, I brought her to the first relief station and noticed a stunning miracle in the field of magic, told Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old apothecist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-year-old, was injured by cuts.
The use of the state police has finally taken over the man who did not take any papers.
The State Administration of Nanterre has commissioned the district referendum of the Criminal Police of Hise (SDPJ 92) with the ruling.
The nurse was hospitalized at Donnerstagend.
In view of his circumstances, he has not yet been duly taken into account.
A police source does not conclude that it will be delivered to a nervous system.
According to another police source, six police officers were forced to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken away.
He is "in a state of over-revealedness" as "all spiritually confused, in which the forces release themselves during the journey".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again requires a criminal prosecution
Roman Polanski, the French-Polish filmmaker's lawyer, has repeatedly called for his execution on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, Western United States, to be brought to trial at his place of residence in Switzerland for a sentence of more than 30 years before the trial.
Chad Hummel, Director of the "Pianist" Law, spoke in the second district of California at the time of the negotiations in 1977 before three judges of the Employment Court.
I insist on the place of punishment, said Mr. Hummel, before he added that the behaviour of the director Laurence Rittenband, who was responsible for dealing with the case, "is a cold to walk down the back."
According to him, the judge - between the dead - Rittenband, before this statement was made, had discussed with a state lawyer who should have told him that Roman Polanski had deserved a house of Zuchtau -- which represented a serious procedural error.
This discussion was created in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), owned by the inquirer state lawyer David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared that at the end of September the authors of the documentary film would have "appropriate".
If the Court of Justice had refused to establish the criminal procedure, Mr Hummel would have asked him to conduct a process that would allow him to provide evidence for his argument.
On the other hand, the complaint has repeated the evidence already made in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion of the suspension of the charges against the accused cannot be taken seriously into account until Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled from the United States in 1978, even before the release of the penalty measure because of "unlawful sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't moved to the United States since then.
The Deputy State Secretary of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "should be there to stay in the negotiations".
In this regard, did you want to spread the message and not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused persons, who are an escape option? Mrs. Asama asks.
According to your opinion, "the filmmaker bids the Court of Justice for a case and thus respects its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision – even prefer "that there should be other refugees".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again demanded the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer hesitate to allow it to be imposed on her client through every relife of the Polanski case and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was right.
Twenty-three years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the execution of an American court order.
After spending two months behind the guitar, he was sentenced to a possible delivery to house arrest in his chalet in Gstad.
Wall Street is broken down by the increase of the dollar and closes without a course.
The New York Towers concluded on Friday without a course, and in a market that was better developed between indicators than planned in the United States and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the end of the figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 is estimated at 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
"To be honest, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend has been supported by the publication of better economic indicators, which have helped to "improve the market view of the solidarity of economic reunification", the analysts of Charles Schwab together.
In the United States sales increased by 1.3% in the single market in November, so it has already been two months and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December, although at 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index.
However, the index was broken down by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has achieved the highest vis-à-vis the euro for two months, which means '' the sectors that are subject to the economic situation will be pushed down," Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank said.
The technological values have lost something on the ground.
The obligation market has expired.
The interest rate increased by 3,540 % by 3,482 % on Wednesday evening over 10 years and the loan increased by 4,497 % by 4,492 % by 30 years.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of running through South Africa, 112 candidates will pass the last door to the title of Miss World on Saturday to make their dream come true: To be chosen for the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch it before a billion televisions.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in the context of Johannesburg, five of which have already been awarded her ticket to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut off during their African stay to Miss Sportive or even Miss Top Model.
This was a real strudel of pleasure.
Nice cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Kap Hoorn, were simply extraordinary.
I've seen many things and made every lot of experiences!, Mrs. Sierra Leone said with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place on the ninth occasion in South Africa and will be transferred to life on Saturday, from 17 a.m. to 15 a.m. in central Europe, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to pass my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, undermining Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the re-discovering of "territory landscapes".
After a month of Galas, trials, encounters with the press and Safari, the misses are now focusing on competition.
The Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to take part in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as in Aishwarya Rai, who was selected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the appearance here.
We are missionaries of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India will enter with a wide layer.
This 59th edition will then be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates are defined in traditional traditions and do not forget, in the addendum.
The presentation is presented by a television moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former beauty queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean and a representative of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is wise to receive the world with a hardly excess heart and steel, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, have made a Safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time cost the bike and the local cuisine.
However, it was quite unusual to meet with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not usually for a Head of State, Ms. Sierra Leone.
However, its most beautiful memory remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (South West) to the football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to buy something more for this event.
I'm dealing with people I could probably never get close to.
I'll be back safely for the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The messages to Johnny Hallyday are said to his son David "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", his son David assured his son on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who had been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday explained the press on the exit of the plane, where he arrived shortly after 13 hours of local time (21 MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxing impression, ensured that he would "fastest" in the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï, in the Johnny Hallyday on Monday due to a bacterial infection after an operation in a band crash on November 26.
The singer was "this night in Los Angeles in a artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and carry out his treatment, the press service was known.
Johnny Hallyday was replaced by the doctors of the hospital Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles in an artificial coma in which he was admitted to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial infection after a band-discharge operation on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night of midnight on Thursday because of the recent outbreaks of the disease.
His wife, Laeticia, took part on Friday at a school event in the French Gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, established an AFP photographer.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The manufacturer seriously charged the neurochirgen Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26th at the International Clinic du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he set up the purest mask.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely exhausted, said Mr Camus.
I have heard that perhaps a court procedure will be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday is "very fast and this is done with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally called this doctor, who assured me that he viewed this trip as completely unproblem, which I had been surprised by, since I had already had two band operations behind me, he added.
Before long he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drawing, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had the actor Marie Trintignant, who performed a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neully-sur-Seine, where he practiced at this time.
In 2007, he also operated the actor Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorbify a haematoma after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a double call, which has already been condemned several times because of failed operations and not to forget, due to tax fraud and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the hospital, has called him "a man without a scratch" who has "regular" to respond to the chamber board and is "all other than recommended".
After a few days of Switzerland, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would be "perfect walking" and the post-operative tests would be "normal".
The operation "did not carry any bleeding before and therefore does not require a drag," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been opening since the last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear from the hand that something is too close to the tour on January 8th (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The UDF Party (Union for the French Democracy) will be energetic and will call on the Nouveau Centre to stop using its Sigel
The party's association, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, has responded with a strong response on Friday to a review of the Sigel, the first party founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, other than the president of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and called on him to make no use of this document during a trial.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of protecting this political heritage after he had reached the left.
The defence minister, whose partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As a result of his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Chartet (formerly UMP, now with the NC), who received a claim for the ownership of the UDF brand, since he first applied for this mark at the National Institute de la Proprieté Industriale 2004.
However, the company's business of the party's UDF, which was monitored by François Bayrous's friends, brought the fraud and clearly understood that they did not agree and set up a time limit for the Minister and the members of the board to refrain from using this seal and transfer it to the rights of the brand.
You have made many statements in recent days that you would propose your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 bureau members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centriistic Union.
They also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the Slogans + of today's UDF + on their political material and on the start page of your website.
As you know, you have no access to the use of this seal, explained the UDF’s business and asked the party NC to “unless the name of UDF is removed from all materials and from (her) website”.
In addition, Hervé de Chartet was asked to transfer the rights of the mark to its legal applicants.
If you refuse to do this, we will appeal against you to obtain respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In her letter, she stressed that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and recalls that Morin and his friends "have taken the election" these 2007 to create a competitive movement, as it had already done in 2002 to create the "UMP" party.
The New Centre, therefore, has no right to use the UDF-Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF 2007 Congress adopted the three-year accession to MoDem party and the establishment of a business facility to protect "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
What Hervé de Chartet needs, the business office continues, "what he has been asking for at the time he has named, has been no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
It benefits in a scandalous and misleading way, from the lack of maintenance of the Acronym's UDF to do this for itself.
Continue to think that this irresponsibility is the best way to turn into a punishment, and ironify the NC's strategy: "But we appear to be more likely in politics and in life to make a name, rather than try to get out of theonymity, by gradually adjusting a name on which there are no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be punished for his failure
On Friday, the Court of Justice of Nanterre decided to assess the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, like the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, has used a weak moment of eight-year-olds to improve some of their assets.
On 15 and 16 April 2010, the 62-year-old photographer who is known for his Starphos will have to be liable on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the abuse of fraud before the court, a penalty which is charged with a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this case which is worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, in which mothers and daughters are pregnant and at the same time have the wings of the L'Oréal cosmetics.
However, the 15 trial chambers also arranged a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, carried out jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's erbin and main actuarial has refused to undertake such an investigation, particularly under the conditions of the state administration of Nantere.
The doctors who are appointed on Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 that clearly shows whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll be conducting these tests.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kieiman, explained after the deal.
What is required by the law of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an excellent novelty (...). The impression is shown that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who needs to be protected, confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists, and accused him of exploiting her mother's weaknesses for years in order to compensate for a billion euros in the form of bankchecks, insurance policies or maps.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographers whom she viewed as a longtime friend.
Although the court had to examine the eligibility of the complaint filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers of lawyers had led to a large family backlog on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt referred himself to three letters sent to her client (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she missed the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years until twice a day.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
The Government of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the complainant was not entitled to respond, especially because a defence judge has rejected her application in the last days to initiate a judicial procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely legal, does not stand under protection and has no precedent.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the representative of State Administration, Marie-Christine Daubignney.
The Court has now decided to grant a judgment after the process of granting permission to Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic morning statement?
If nothing changes with the leadership of the large French company, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been a bit ...
Since over a decade, the position of the management of large companies in relation to its employees has been the opinion of the company vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: "values" for the staff is the best thing to do with the consumer products of the technicians.
By offering customers at the company's centre, the marketing revolution has given the strategies for market distortion in place ... although the authoritarian testing products separate factors preferences for customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demolition.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the peaks of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly those of F&Eand, which is still crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligent Economics = Economic Intelligence) requires "proactive action by all parties involved (...) and a forward-looking approach"; it requires staff to use a completely contrary to the instructions of the authority management.
That is why we call for a business revolution that would be in place for employees to be equal to customers in the middle of the company's loans.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion questions
Are the internal issues of opinion, how did the questionnaire, which the Orange has distributed its beneficiaries, attract this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I was afraid, I'm not.
- First of all, because I was able to determine that the whole addition in view of a new situation on many sides finally reaches it, primarily to do so, what it has always done.
Also because of authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power-proportional takes over the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most driving forces have a very simple idea of human behavior.
Experience from the great engineering schools is mechanically interpreted by their psychology.
They take by intellectual comfort the old observatory theory, which recently reacted by the U.S. neurosciences, and has been widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
So and by suggesting that it is possible to implement the "Hebel" (sic) for the engagement of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey revealed by Ipsos strengthens the driving forces in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobility factors
Instead, a necessary revolution for the free functioning of modern companies is presuming to adopt a definitive approach to human behaviour.
It is designed to integrate a basic protocol in any interpretation or practice of control: for the recipients, the commitment to the company is possible only if it appears clearly as a means to achieve some of its dreams, honours and purposes.
Currently, only studies from the multifunctional analysis take this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their purpose of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobility factors, companies can control, predict and move their "social performance" leadership and re-place their human resource management at the right place.
In this way they create a productive land that is valuable for the successful development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "Right War" brings Obama Lob from the right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed Barack Obama's earlier speech in Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize protected the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had opposed the award to Obama on 9 October praised the president's speech following the example of the former Vice-President candidate during the 2008 election of Sarah Palin.
I miss what he said, explained Palin, the face of the right flight of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself had brought the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war into the language of her as well as published memoirs.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, they say.
Obama, who fought two wars by his predecessor, George W. Bush, who fought in Iraq and in Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; one way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, shares the view that the president has read "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, and the former President of the representative's house, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this speech has appeared quite historically, Ginrich, who was asked in the radio release "The Takeaway".
The previous rapporteur, who was considered by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to see a "president of the Left" who reminded the Nobel Committee members that they would "not be free and could not afford a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and former editor at Washington Post, Obama held "a very American talk".
In addition, he represents himself as "cosmopolitan", as he has always done," he has spoken "as an American president," when he points out that the Europeans are living in a security bottle that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconfirmed rights, former UN messenger John Bolton, a falcon of the Åra Bush, referred to on the website of the National Review Online as "long, high-end and inspirationless".
On the left of the president, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the return to the fighting forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the mask can easily justify the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the agreed links continues to praise the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like he, who is known for his talent as "Mummeralwork".
The talk in Oslo "gives a run-up plan to control international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times is the view that Obama "preached the necessary discourse" and refers to his speech as "stupid and exemplary at the same time".
Trainer: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the road link and the TLF - the only organization of workers who remained to the end - came to an agreement on the freeway which puts the strike order and the disturbing heavy supply pass on Christmas nights.
At the signing meeting on Friday, the State Secretary responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement entered into on Wednesday after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiating parties were hoping to sign the agreement quickly on Monday morning.
And although the three employees (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the end of the agreement, the agreement was signed only at 18:00.
The conflict "would have added a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that he would interfere with the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The Agreement provides for an increase of 4 % for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest groups (international transport).
The rate of hours for workers with the lowest wages therefore rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not very much, but we're just getting a little at first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now indicated not to block the supply centres anymore.
"But it will probably always be given some adversaries who are not satisfied with the consent," he adds.
The TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to overcome these wage increases in view of international competition".
As a result, the increase is at EUR 170 per month for the low and between EUR 100 and EUR 120 for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on a healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), though Thierry Duine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
In this regard, Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed himself about "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3 % and for the maintenance of the total road transport network in the first half of 2010, allowing in particular to cover the 13-month maintenance and modernisation of the tariff agreements.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "the decline in the fees for workers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the bill for 2009 which was adopted by the National Assembly on Friday evening.
The government requires "a identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be first applied to the undertakings associated with this organisation and, accordingly, to be valid in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the whole profession.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, secured by Bussereau.
The opposition of the employer union can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR's association launched a "supplier trade" because the 100 million euros had already been promised to the sector in comparison with a portion of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport urges us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not in order to discourage the Gans-Esser on the coming Christmas Day, the Unostra regrets.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "in the next 12 months, small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry will have a great deal of fun".
Line RER A: Breakdowns this week, trade unions with the proposals of RATP
The disturbances on the DER A line, the largest speed line in France for the Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, on the 2nd day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independence of the Paris passenger transport manager), will continue to wait for disputes with their demands for payment.
At this important shopping week before Christmas, between 10:00 and 20:00 there were no trains. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of the two trains and outside the central route was used only one of the four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travelers to convert.
The shopping cart Galeries Lafayette, which counts every day 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect large businesses in a traffic technique".
The RER A line passes the Parisian balloon space from West to East.
The section of the RATP connects the places Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains was scheduled for the main journey time, and almost none during the transport time.
As already on Thursday, there was no man's turn on the streets, since the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had set themselves on the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of St. Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less than the rest, especially because of the lack of Gymnasians.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would be extra "a half an hour earlier to come to work".
The SNCF, which had planned a survey of passengers by officials and order forces, showed that there had been no interference in the Saint-Lazare Train Station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Sergey-Le-Hout were either over Saint-Lazare Train Station to ensure the connection to the Metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, major meetings of the strikers took place, while the results were reviewed, which had established the connections after the meeting with the lead point on Friday afternoon as "required".
The RER Manager proposed the specific development of a protocol for line A for all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they ask for a long-lasting payment.
The CGT claimed that the RATP itself puts its loan proposals in clammers and stressed that the lead track was "not able to solve a problem while it was possible for the trainers and SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting would be planned for the "extensive examination of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend".
On the morning of the morning, about 150 drivers were looking for a committee to be held in Paris.
Once again, it was the guiding point that until that date, every discussion during the strike had been rejected, and a meeting was drawn up after a slowing down.
On Tuesday, the conflict broke out after an announcement by Usa and Independents to the RER B line.
The associations require a payment of € 120 (Unsa) to 150, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents). In addition, they accuse the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which are on the daily basis of millions of passengers.
The drivers of the RER line, which have over the course of years professional experience, relate to a gross of EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 and a loan of EUR 600 to EUR 650 for ski services and sun and holidays.
The Court of Justice of the Turkish Constitutional Court of the Pro-Curdian Party shall issue a decision with serious consequences.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the pro-Kurdian main party of the country; a decision followed on the inexhaustible demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision makes it extremely difficult for the Government to work hard to reach the Kurdish community to end the 25-year conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it became a "City of Activities which is responsible for the independence of the State and its non-participating unity", said President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilic four days after the press decision.
According to Kilic, the decision would have been made unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to delay the resolution, and he also pointed out that 37 of the party's leadership forces, including the President Ahmet Turkey and Parliamentary President Aysel Tugluk, have been shut down for the duration of five years from the political case.
Furthermore, the judge announced the suspension of parliamentary immunity, the Turkish and Tugluk and the confiscating of the party's interests.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The participants argued that Parliamentarians would prefer to leave the Parliament rather than take it as partial parliamentarians.
The decision was followed in 2007 by the State attorney of the Turkish Federal Court of Justice Abdurrahman Yalczinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "revelations" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Several observers have the view that the DTP is the legal political watch window of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that "no connection" to the PKK, however, it refuses to designate them as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court is the responsibility of the Government, inter alia, to oppose the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to allow the PKK to be supported by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict.
The leader of the DTP confirmed that a resolution could lead to a re-examination of the tensions in South-Anatolia, where many demonstrations against PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to conflicts with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of the Court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the rooms of the DTP in the millions in the city of Diyarbakir in the south, mostly inhabited by Kurds.
When the demonstrators began to beat Molotowcocktails and stones, the order forces set up the train-grains and water-drawers.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the judgment, Turkey concluded that the decision of the Court would "open the dispute further".
"Turkey can't explain this (Curdish, etc.) question under the ban of a party," he explained.
The Government, consisting of a party that has been removed from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are against principle against the conclusion of the parties.
That doesn't solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a violation of the democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"Man can clearly determine a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK became known as an attack by seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days ago. It was one of the most brutal attacks in the past month.
The snowfall may occur
A really hot winter, that's what Wolfgang Braubuer wants.
Not because he wants to get rid of the citizens, says the FES winter service director.
In addition, his staff can test and manage the whole vehicle technology.
On the weekend it could be called meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES will then proceed to a precise plan.
As soon as it is smooth enough in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-tracks with large-powered vehicles are removed, explained Brauburger.
These include the main road transport and transit routes, such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire routes, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with accidents, such as the Atzelberg Street.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers had to be pushed in a maximum of three hours with fat salt, which was better.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock in the evening, "so that the streets are free until the work begins".
It'll be hard if it's only 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service director, "because then no one is ready to replace the truck".
First of all, as soon as it is not so fast, there are supply and settlement routes, which also belong to the Council's Beil Street.
The last priority has side and sideways.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
About five o'clock in the morning, the people of the FES are on their way, danger points and crossings.
For all routes, the FES can't be most concerned.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that keeps the brakes in the eye from 22 to 4.30 hours above all, says Braubuer.
Because it is on this fast course, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the stream goes down.
This will also be called by the police if necessary.
The walls of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other flexible dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1,50 meters wide animal loved on two powerful hind legs, had a long damage with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with steel wheels and a long scar.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then located in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangäa at Ecuador.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about relations, the expansion and the characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists started with a recording on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes one day we have found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is exemplary for landings from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the knots identified the researchers quickly as a new species.
During the graduation, they brought together the remaining five individuals.
Found confirmed theories about the dinosaur's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sungot of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary fund: "Dinosourary fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, most of them only find individual benefits."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiastism.
This fund is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of Bonn University.
After the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are imperfect, because the design of this urn is often contradictory.
This is how experts debate, for example, when the eczemas broke up in their three main development lines: the flu-freethropods, which later became the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velocyraptor and also the birds, who were known as the "longhose" and their relatives, and the plants that were fresher Ornithicia (Vygelbekensauri), for example, belonging to the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is an original therapist.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
In the disaster of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, as they also owned the trails of the Theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the air bag, the birds’ breathing is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At the Tawa hall, the bones of the vibula were also partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive therapist with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the associated line of the huge sauropods later also had air sacs and light-building knots, it is likely that this useful innovation had already been developed by the common practice of both groups.
At least three migration villages in North America
Since the most famous dinosaurs have been living in South America for a long time, researchers have found that the roots are there for the first time.
The three development lines were already broken up early and spread from South America over all parts of the world, which were still forming a single country mass as Supercontinent Pangjaa.
The fact is that the team, together with Tawa, took the rest of the two others, did not find particularly closely related theropodes.
The three cannot deviate from a common, emerging practice, argue researchers.
We believe that there were at least three migration villages in North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-founder of science study.
There are also objections for freedom.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says the Bonner Pallaonologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted by the fact that in South America there were just a lot of primitive Dino fossils left, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs were able to develop from a relatively rare side line of the Replica to the dominant agricultural crops of the Mediterranean, it is still legitimate.
During the Trias the dinosaurs shared their living room with many other reptiles, for example with the practices of today's crocodiles and the air-sauris and many other lakes.
At the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread across the world and developed many new species, while the relationship between the Trias and the Jura disappeared.
Success stories won't last forever
There are two hypotheticals to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that eventually survived the dinosaurs, but the other Repellians did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could win the competition from the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack on a group of animals had already developed in the Trias, and since then a saggies had been released: the pigs.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto are at the University of Cambridge, Uni Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
There are dozens of Neapels, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casinos of Frankfurter Goethe University is the world's well.
278 Professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from colleges throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, align themselves with the protesting students at the Campus Westend.
In a statement in German and English, "missible" they constitute the police station carried out by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had allowed the buildings owned by students and teachers in the education sector to be spaced in the past week because the walls and works of art were cut off.
Five students were injured.
The damages, judge the signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organised teaching events by students and teachers by a police command".
The space is an "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "dedication and criminalization of the protest" and slow down the content.
The Presidium has withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The doctors require the immediate imposition of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the owners did not support the damage, it is.
Protest legitimately
The youth of the Verdi Association and the German Trade Union also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says Secretary of State Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the presidency and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and destruction are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden's day.
We have understanding of the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, so does the CDU member Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they see the opposition fractions SPD, green and left.
The CDU takes the wrong way forward to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Link).
Instead of setting aside the arguments and demands of the students, you have roomed.
The link submitted an application to the Interior Minister to report on the police presence.
New Silicon-Valley
For years she was considered a secret city, not accessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded place in the Soviet Union for secret recreation research.
Today the municipality is located with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from the Moscow center, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had contacted Frankfurter Sciences Centre Riedberg - with the Union institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Professor Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, who signed a plannered Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific mode
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be allowed to catch on the growing Russian market foot.
On the other hand, Russian science companies want to make contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
This includes the Moscow Institute for Electronics, the major companies of Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronica.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planetary city" for the research of solutions.
Selenograd (a.k.a. "Grünstadt") received his name from the managed hospital in which the research facilities are located.
Stuttgart Bremsklottz
The size of Stuttgart 21 can't be quite high enough.
For the sponsors of the project it is difficult and simple to "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monster building project, which will be destroyed by the city of Baden-Württemberg Country Capital for a decade in yellow construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
In the middle of the city, head-to-head cables, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered to be the technical fossils of the 19th century, which acted as the brakes of a modern rail transport, since it took a lot of time to spin around the backs.
Just keep moving, keep moving - so let's go.
And that's why the headheads should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a railway station located about half of the trans-European skiing Magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, which is why the slogan from "Mr. Europe".
S21 will be actually launched now, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have found that it is almost unfunded in the Hessian and the Bayrian great city.
However, headaches do not have any problems with driving and driving, since there are modern trailers with tricycles and control cars at both ends.
However: Stutgart 21 is now under the ICE neo-neaustreck to Ulm.
National and municipal politicians have implemented it.
The train is also involved because the risks of the biggest single infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the state companies are involved.
The project is still in a number of ways.
There is a new city hall, which - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planner - is equipped with a lot of greens.
For the traffic system, S21 is dangerous.
The railway station and the road construction are thought to be the traffic of the person who, typically 80 years of age, has grown to a great extent.
At the time, there was still no competition between the ticketers.
Modern transport policy, however, must first go to strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than via Lkw on the road.
However, the neouptake is not due to severe increases in the supply of goods.
It's even more serious that S21 is also indirectly languaged by many other railway projects.
Good six billion euros are to be banned in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts hold ten to 15 billion for realistic.
It is true that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and closings in the network.
All six larger projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the development of the good 180 kilometers along the river.
Since 1987 it has been built on the track in the timeframe.
Swinging would be necessary to press right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The railway route will be the bottleneck for international freight: in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the Court of Justice at the airport
In Wiesbaden's country day, the Government has given public evidence whether they will be reviewed against the decision of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on a night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the VGH section of more than 400 pages legally, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written this day that the country had to re-regulate the night's flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Land Railway in Frankfurt Airport.
The permit of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as the Government foresees, is not compatible with the legal protection of the people before nightly flights.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if it is against the Court of Auditors.
The opposition criticized this uprising and urged the representatives of the government to reject a revision of the Federal Court of Justice in Leipzig.
SPD-Fraction Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their prior election contracts to a night's flight ban. Otherwise, this would be considered a "word break".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in play on the FDP election log "We hold the word".
Minister Posch showed back the draft of a ship-gumbel, trying to get the country's government back with a "right-run and tricks series" yet to arrive at their flights at night.
A precise legal examination requires their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a more secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they reflected the opposition, the statements of his group were not to be banned at night.
U.S. Banks Number Help Back
The crisis-stricken U.S. Grand Banks are breaking down their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Banking Fund at a total of $45 billion (U.S. 30 billion) to a fine.
And the Citi group also plans to replace State aid after a report by the US-Sender CNBC.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions that have been imposed by the adoption of the money – such as the restriction on the payment of managerboni and the correction of high charges.
The Bank of America had taken good care of 19 billion dollars of fresh money for investors.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which was well-filled, among other things, by sales of Sparta.
Banker Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude at the middle of the night for the American tax payer: the money cuts have helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had increased to the point of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citi group also wants to earn money on the capital market to be freed from its obligations to the State.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a serious increase in its capital, reported C.C.C.C. on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to go outside.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Select
Then everything went faster than expected.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Governing Council had forced the executive chief editor Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the sender could present a follow-up.
Yesterday evening, the board wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, leader of the ZDF-Mauptstadtstudios in Berlin.
However, it was not officially confirmed by the sender in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it may also have played a role in harming the ZDF-intenant Markus Schachter, and this proposal should not be passed on to the Administrative Board.
Frey, Skächer's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 Grim Members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schätter, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, was divided into the Administrative Board.
Only seven members spoke out for the brender, seven voted against him. Brender's Abbahl was a very low-fashioned, promising but.
Because the Union majority in the Board of Directors had already notified the election weeks ago that they did not want to confirm the brands in the office.
The opposition was organized against the Chief Editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument, under brands, the ZDF's messages had been lost at exclusive rates, he left another office of the top-view editor.
Before the election, therefore, there were protests in which political influence was limited to the ZDF.
In the past, even 35 national lawmakers had been involved in the debate, who appreciated the progress of milk as constitutional.
It doesn't matter.
Personal
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogical and Romantic.
Then he worked at the Southwest Funk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey changed to the ZDF, first to the today-journal.
Following stations: from 1988 to 1990 personal reference to the Chief Editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 leader and moderator of the "Morgen Magazines"; to 2001 leaders of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then Head of the ZDF-Maintstadtstudio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the April Brenders, which was chosen by the media magazine for journalists of the year on Wednesday.
Kochs Väderpart of the Administrative Board, Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF Treaty so that the personal proposals of the intentionors cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party policies from the supervisory framework of the ZDF is also an exception.
Brender's prospective successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Board of Directors with a clear shot - by criticising the panel immediately after the firefight.
Thanks to this statement of journalism independence, he was able to appoint both victims without face loss for the posts of the Chief Editor and the Board of Directors, without having to be suspected of carrying a participant into the office.
In the partarithmetic, Frey is credited to the left-liberals.
The study is formed
Partly for the students: After one year of education, the Minister of Culture of the Countries finally joined: at a meeting of the Minister of Culture and High School Sectors conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
The students should be in a position to discuss their study in the future.
In each case, they agreed to reduce the test load: essentially each study module should only be completed with a single test.
In addition, the work load of the students should be reviewed and provided "a realistic and representative measure".
In addition, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to developing common structural objectives for Bachelor and Master studies more flexible.
These different national rules should not be given in addition.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Minister of Culture and the United Rectors have taken the word of the best studentability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to gradually reduce the number of tests: "Each module usually ends with only one test", which is part of a 30-page paper that should partially reorganise the approval of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the test load", the Accreditation Council President Reinhold Grimm stated that a "female development will be required which has significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" should be "the decisive criterion" in the design future.
Modules such as "to examine closely" are "to examine" if "unneeded conclusions of students when selecting the
Events would be avoided."
The students would have "require to get playrooms to enable and promote their own initiatives".
The rules should be re-examined in the authorisation, but also in the examination of existing studies.
These must be "recorded" every five years – which, however, means that it will last until 2015 until all studies have been checked.
It is also responsible for ten accreditation agencies which support the accreditation board established by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had called on the countries in October to "with pressure" to influence the agencies that the dust is not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and universities with the Ministry of State have already taken appropriate measures.
As a single country, Rheinland-Pfalz added additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
In particular, higher education programmes should be set up to promote education and training, as well as research and abroad.
Countries and schools want to use 10 million euros for this.
In early 2010, the government wanted to introduce a novel of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
After this, only one test should be required for the conclusion of a study model.
The study is to be more flexible and to ensure the recognition of performance indicators at other schools and facilitate access to the Master.
Until the end of the year, all studies in the country should be checked on their feasibility.
On Thursday, the government and opposition again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to Lob, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Bureau of Juso High Schools asked that the development of education policy should no longer be "in closed doors" of the ministers and high schools.
At the end of the course of education, students should also now say "a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Director's Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need students' experiences," she said on Thursday when she met with the Culture Ministers, with which the HRK talks about a common reform paper.
The work force Education and Science (GEW) did not fully reach the Bonner decisions: it calls for a legal claim that allows every graduate with a Bachelor conclusion access to a continuing master’s study.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that there are sufficient master positions available for the current generation of Bachelor students in the morning with the best possible study conditions, such as Andreas Keller, GEW member.
The countries must clearly set up more than one percentage.
However, the Minister of Culture did not extend his free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering into Germany and out there is almost no control..." the initial number of a poem by Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which it highlights the arrival experience of a dissident who has won the freedom but has lost his language level at the same time.
In 1951, Werner Söllner, born in the Romanian Banat, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a bookstore, before he moved to Frankfurt in May 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurter Poetik in Goethe University, and has been the leader of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Moison Tower in Frankfurt since 2002.
He attended a meeting in Munich on the last service day, during which he went about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of their security acts".
Söllner is obviously insecure and leaves a statement in which he, in front of Romanian-English fellow writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, was hired as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service Security.
In 1989, Söllner, together with some of the delegates, had received the German language price.
The application tests had begun badly, first in 1971.
I'm, in conclusion, "so someone who hasn't risked himself enough against the search for security."
The Lyrics Werner Sölner is an IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unexplained literary austerity with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literature scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, will be excommunicated by a case that exposes the grounds and the subversibility of a political system based on monitoring and prosecution.
Werner Söllner is, so far you can say, not only doers, but also victims.
In his Security Act, IM Walter played a role, said according to Sölner of the literature scientist Michael Markel, and pointed to the positive influence of the IM Walter.
He's got him in all the difficult points for him at the time, so Markel.
It would be a moral need for him to make this observation.
In the form and before this publication, however, it is not surprising that a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service was recognized.
If Germany had been a comfortable reservation for security mirrors, Herta Müller had already written in July in time after reading her own act, 914 pages.
In some cases, those involved may be confused and may have also been aware of whose name behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to the country in which the process is carried out, the treatment with the security surveillance teams is still very widespread.
A systematic disclosure has been delayed and stopped in recent years.
One of the Birthler Authority’s National Council for the Management of Security Acts (CNSAS) was established in 1999 only, but the issue of the documents was rather slow.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of the acts.
That the influence of former security members in Romania was still very high, following the recognition of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former security chief from Temesvar issued an interview on the clergy.
She's got a psychosis, she's finally just heard it once.
The infamity of power was considered to be totally unreputable in the form of freedom of thought.
Certain concerns are related to the case of Söllner, as often as in relation to removed debt, inevitable questions.
First of all, who has been hurt? The special reaction of the members of the Sölners can be expected to know that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by knowledge than by instruction and discipline.
For the generation of the work of Herta Müller, which has taken the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Set-aside Championships League
It turned out that there was just an adrenal outdoor servant from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports producer Goodies had distributed it when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored plastic sheet of the equipment, increased a quarter hour after midnight in a high-level C-class.
The man with the brand-new glass allowed himself to move to another city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game at all, and the 55-year-old was very little before happiness.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just straight out.
In the words of the first three days ago committed Switzerland, "We have reached the end of the final", namely in the League Championships, thanks to the 3 1 success of Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we cannot forget about the success: it will be a brutal fight against the decline."
The "very important task" is before Sunday.
Then it is appropriate to resume the royal service in Mainz on the Liga Day.
And the once-opened weaknesses are to be removed after the rapid three towers by Marica (5.), Drish (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Resolution
The final end of the Championships League (Hinspiele 16./17. + 23/24 February/ Backgame 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the full-fledged attitude of the Babel followers remained.
Not only in the rare health provider, who had recently shown confidence in his own self-confidence, willingness to use and pleasure of playing.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and had kept them, to be more courageous, explained soul-climate Gross that was so easy to succeed, which had not shown any more effect under the therapist Babbel.
He invented a certain magic, gave Babel-Babbel-buffer Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes things that you wouldn't have been able to keep."
And Sami Khadira, who, after a week-long break thanks to his dynamics as well as the best player on the spot, tried to describe the established "plenomes" with the explicit "fresh wind" and the working way of the new crew: "He is a man who goes through and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babel, it had obviously changed.
The VfB Stuttgart is still not over the mountain, sports president Horst Heldt warns
However, the VfB Stuttgart needs more than constant.
Like Gross, the players and managers also wanted to assess the victory against a rather weak and completely excessive rejection of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, four days later in Liverkusen at 0:4 the bad wakes came to Khedirra to think.
And the Sports Board Horst Heldt held that although a seasonal goal was achieved, the other was still in the distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That sounds like his 40th birthday, even after the first home page for three months after the festival, was on the events of the weekend, which occurred in the form of a television interview published immediately before the start of the game by Torhüter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that the others make and not the Jens, Heldt told the hard criticism of Lehmanns.
The Board of Directors had made a mistake and had decided to change the training on press Pubertering fans.
Even if his free day was tied to games, Lehmann was valued as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and mistrust.
Lehmann's statements were "depressed by pure egoism", heldt called back and announced consequences for the final man.
They'll probably not be friends for life anymore, the two of them are four years old.
However, they agreed with all others that without the processing by the dissolved training team, it would not be possible to have the strong idea of playing and fighting.
Babbelle and his assistants had "a great deal of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisano - and also the man agreed with the plastic cut.
WM-Fight in Weight
Today's Duell in Bern: again and again challenging Kevin Johnson World Master Vitalali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainians protected their weight loss title after the WBC version.
The Court of First Instance ruled unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the Box World Master in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion, after the release of the WBC, visited US-American Kevin Johnson on Saturday evening in Bern on Monday (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after its return in October 2008.
The Ukrainians were already two world masters of the related WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice he had to be beaten on account of injuries.
In the 24th battle, challenging Johnson had to take the first landing.
Before about 17,000 visitors to Berner Arena, the 2,02 meters big Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left hand.
The 11 centimetre smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko-Era before the duel, however, has always turned away from the Master of the World, so that Klitschko could not make his dangerous rights decisive.
Overall, the passive Johnson did little for a challenge and tried only to get through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his tears met the world master but only rarely.
However, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went through the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had taken care of some of the Wirebels before the battle in Switzerland.
He taught Klitschko as "haustic zombie", who can't be right."
On the beach, the champion then made an effort on Friday to create Johnson's sunglasses from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory by Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also won in his fourth battle after his return on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years, he had killed the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and resumed his "WBC-Gürttel," which he had to give before fighting.
In this year, he was forced to defend Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
I just got a shot in this fight and I'm physically very well in shape, Klitschko had established the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the World Master of the Related WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA's gate is followed by the British David Haye, who was able to withdraw the 2,13 - foot - high Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had mentioned a battle planned for September in the summer against Vitali Klitschko.
Its promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal alert from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin has called Minister of Defence Guttenberg for false information about Kunduz-Affrey as a liar.
SPD and link require clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the recent findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor to Gutenberg (CSU) has submitted a conscious increase.
The minister said on a fatal bombing on two tanclair trains from September "sensely the uncertainty," said Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD press release "Dayview".
It's called the earthquake: he lied.
The order to kill was given under the rules of the International Defence Forces for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report which NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday it was announced that the attack was not only to destroy the loaded cargo, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
According to the Nato investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz Commander Oberst Klein.
Greens, SPDs and links urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to get out of front of the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy for the intended death is part of the federal government's Afghan policy - and whether Chancellor, Federal Affairs and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green College Renate Kunast asked.
Ulrich Wilhelm, a government speaker, showed that the criticisms were decided back.
The Chancellor did not have an influence on the specific uses of the Federal Sea in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts at the Ministry's presentation on the grounds of the resignation of Inspector-General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have been properly and fully informed about the backdrops of the tanker approach.
Officially, it had been forgotten that they had claimed the existence of the Nato records and kept the Minister sensitive to the details.
However, in the context of the two top officials, it was alleged that they had referred the Ministry of Defence to several reports, including a two-day document on the ordering officer Klein and a field-year report.
Wichert should have prayed between a letter to clarify the matter, reports the "Frankfurter General Sunday's Day".
He had not received an answer until he received it.
The Ministry did not object on Saturday, and pointed out that this would be made clear in the Committee of the Investigations of the Bundestag who wanted to establish himself next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality are eliminated.
As long as it happens in bed, it's all right.
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can unmistakably introduce the coolest imaginations and fantasy images.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in growth see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world, are often considered crazy or sad, at least as special.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in mental or drug abuse.
Debt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images, or write novels make it possible to remove the boundaries between dream, smell and reality.
Marvelously changed alert senses can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of Wahn.
Even if the visions of the mysterious Hildegard of Bingen, the experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamic withdrawal condition, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Halluzinations or vats occur when the equivalent weight of the neuronal nutrients of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin - is balanced and the interaction of different brain components is broken.
Complex hallucinations and persistent thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force has no power over him.
The relationship of vahan and dream has been in the hands of philosophers and doctors since the Antiques.
Aristotle described Halluzunizations as a form of the dream in a awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founder of modern psychology, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the Irresein with dreams", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the urecipitities, drawings, sensations of such a kind".
It is Herbst 2001 when Henning T. is transformed into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The force has no power over him, he moves to the room deck.
He's going to have a trip.
In front of him he was flying demons with blueots, confused frescoes, sneezing.
They chase him, they hit him with heavy, flaming arrows, they shoot him against the walls, he touches the pain all over the body.
Sounds, bad voices flow out of walls and radio.
He can no longer raise them to vote that replaces him and policies.
Henning T. takes two cables from the stereo system, connects them to a sledge and binds them on a hook on the deck.
He goes up to a speaker and puts his fingers around his neck.
Springt.
The Schlinges are free.
That should be a lesson to you, the voices cry in a trumpet blast, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
She was released by LSD.
His diagnosis causes schizophrenia-paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I've experienced the worst fear and deep confusion, he says.
The drum pictures are a gravous reality
At least one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics, they are treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected cannot usually distinguish between inside and outside the world, resulting in an excessive condition that can lead to Hallusions, sizes, relationships or persecution.
In particular, the voice is extended - voices that order, comment or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned is no longer able to separate himself from the minor, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is overcome by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the keys to a stream of ideas and fantasy that generate deeper consciousness.
The reality assessment in the psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, of the General Psychiatry Hospital at Heidelberg University Clinic.
The schizophrenia is located in the centre of the event, everything has an important meaning to it.
At the same time, he plays a passive role, he becomes, like in the dream, overcomes the events and cannot be actively designed.
Therefore, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the mirror images are grassed reality, shutting down.
Once in life to experience a Hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the emotional and spatial structure of the reality that will be taken into account in the psychosis remains fundamental."
The enduring thoughts and hallucinations were in reality, the promotion of experience is in the real framework.
Why exactly hit our brains, researchers are still standing in front of advice.
Exceptions can lead to short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic arrangement for schizophrenia, but bilingual studies have shown that the genes are not the only specific factors.
Researchers believe that there are minimal damage to the brains concerned.
We suspect that the neuronal healing of the brain is damaged in an early stage of development, by a virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fuchs explains.
But there remains a clue as to how the neurological system is going to be damaged, which will not even manifest itself in the first place over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be resolved for a psychosis if the provision is available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can eliminate psychosis as they enter the transmission system.
If our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer under their hallucinations and switch their medications to release them, other money for drugs, to get what to get, says Professor Erich Kasten, Lübeker Psychology.
Whether to find dry images as pleasant or unsatisfied is often just a question of the position.
Casten has been collecting reports about Halluzionations and Surgeons for ten years, and last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Real World in Our Head".
Hallucinations include the typical appearances of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as Borderline or depression, there are often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and injury erythema.
Surprisingly, the brain is hallucinated under certain conditions even without humans.
Hallucinations, such as cassettes, come together from memory content that are normally retained.
They occur when hirnareale, in which sensory memory is processed, is overactive or less secreted; when our brain is hot or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can resolve this condition as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But there are also travel trends, stress, love rooms or other mental exclusions.
In younger studies, up to a third of the respondents had at least once in their lives experienced Hallucination.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the Gymnasium.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the images and voices.
In the break it may occur that a lucky young man with long, dark hair responds.
When he is answered, the students look at it with surprise - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They hold the sweetest girl for a complicated living room, but Sarah K. doesn't sleep, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees these guys, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank.
She can even smell her presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boys.
I'm crazy, she's sometimes asking.
But she knows that this young man and the other drums are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are most touching
At least the images are also a load.
If she sits in the classroom, she may not be able to follow the teaching material because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations for all others that are heard and visible on the table.
At night, the appearances are often overwhelming.
When she waits in her dark room on the bed, which is too rare and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the sisters or the girls with the bleeding cuts on arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the designs.
Parents and friends tell them nothing about what they would think they're crazy about.
Herbst 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
In the past year, she has been a Abitur and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the Hallusions stopped.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also an art work of doubt
If a person is socially isolated or leads on a journey, he is likely to have a lot of hallucinations, says Casten.
I suspect that the brain is then underworked and is self-sustained for its maintenance.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl feared other children, often played alone.
Her Hallucinations began when she experienced 13 that the man she called Father since she could think she was not her natural father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same region of the brain that also handle real impressions and noises, it is difficult to distinguish such things as Sarah K. Hard, dry images and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "finds in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that let the brain come out, so they work so real."
Night dream images also serve casten as a form of Hallucination.
Hallucinations of health do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mental health is able to recognize their dry images as unrealistic.
It is therefore possible for his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as well as their special capacity.
Border status between dream and Hallucination
In our highly consciously-centred world, imaginary experience is often pathological, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief of the Psychiatry and Psychotherapy clinic of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also produces positive, creative - which is also an art work of doubt.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called uniroid experience, a special form of the dramatic change in consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed Quasi dreams that keep the survivors real and that can't be different from the wake-up condition.
The state of uniroided consciousness arises in situations of trauma or illness, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motor breakdown in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self-destruction and the world, that is, by persistent, complete mobility, he replaces the life-threatening reality by a personal, imaginary world that is linked to reality, says Schmidt Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and Hallucination.
Since it is not possible to address a situation in reality, a world change will take place, but the reality will be modernized in imagination.
An intense form of consciousness and consciousness in a situation that enables us to create our own capacity to do nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher artist Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Development" as the salvation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness took place after a heart attack operation with associated heart transplantation for a long time, while his body was judged on the intensive movement station.
Clossen grew into a self-made world, visiting other times and places: He experienced as an old man, on the board of a train sanatorium, waiting for a robot over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under algae, which produces red cells from blood.
He will be shot by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, face his hospital bed in the branch of the Alps and meet a Korean Mafioso.
It goes completely on in the imaginary case, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal journeys vary considerably from one dream to another.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are clear even after years and in further detail.
More clear and intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience spreads the horizon of our other life-threatening experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt Degenhard.
The last end shows oneroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drugs, how useful our internal images of the external reality are also in the wake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist castten, "can lead to a transformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can be very satisfying too.

Burda
Children are expected to experience the accident at 27 years of age
The new rebel chief calls a solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
Holding is also expected to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The Leigher Hubert Burda sees his company for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children grow up at 27 years of age and have the firm's strong will to join them, said the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We have dealt with the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises first.
The question is whether they are in a position to do so.
It is not possible to provide 7500 employees with their children if they are not adequately equipped.
That also brings the children around and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he had returned from January to the Presidency and appointed Paul-Bernhard Callen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Calle has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
In time, the Treasury area was responsible for the company’s ability to do so and, after the divorce of Jürgen Höffer, also for direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the list.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, today 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The name of Callen also means "10, 15 years to pass", as Burda said.
Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of Schickedance and Schaeffler, Burda said that also family businesses are not safe before the transition: "This is always the case for families who are exposed to a capital search that has been completely mirrored and thought they could rise to such a huge player.
My strategy wasn't that.
He's had "new world power dreams," as Burda did.
I do not see myself as the political president of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the world with 'Time', these people have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in view of beauty and wellness is now available to you.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, who recently opened a cargo business with a area of more than 1000 m2im shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around the body.
In the wellness area, which is located in the eighth floor, you can find other companies, such as Hedonai, who provide for a change with laser; Spaxión, with rooms to relax and for beauty treatments; the Friseur Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food distribution that rises through her tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
A relaxing massage together with your partner to have a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours to rent the relax area to put your own "beautiful party" on your feet with eight friends and then to relax in the Whirlpool or with massages and a glass champagne, these are just a few of the opportunities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2 distributed for the latest face and body treatments and for hydrotherapy in 12 rooms.
For example, for the kavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, and there are virtual trainers who care about the training units of customers and offer them a complete personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is opposite the devices.
Then show you different videos how you conduct your training units correctly.
The director of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and cooling) are fully enough to train the body muscles.
Once you have trained your body, even at the Friseursalon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room, in which treatment for hair rehearsal, glazing and health for your hair is offered in a custom manner and manner.
Innovation and exclusion seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the city, which has always been opened from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 365 days a year.
The most diverse Decollets
Christmas always draws closer, and that is why it is a good opportunity again to copy the star's appearance and to take their tight clothes into our clothes.
The form of the Decolleté, which is very important for the advancement of the Silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen a very sophisticated and complicated decolleté. You can only open it.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endesa has created the "LIVE Bureau" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electricity cars in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric cars) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and reach agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project should be developed to promote electricity cars and opinions and measures in the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport for the future.
3 "Electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include such activities as energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative at the endesa to participate in the promotion of the electric car.
The company is involved in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the car sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the prophecy of the Spanish automotive industry, the country's worst exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled once again the abuses that the government has taken to support the automotive sector during the government's year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, today we had a panorama of the collapse and the collapse of some of our main production works," the president of the government said.
"In view of this plan and the availability of car manufacturers, also in Spain, in the future in a highly competitive industry, we can see a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our grave export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the total automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which have also provided for investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the Government's measures to address the demand, in line with the 2000E Plan, which is applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6 % in the average, which again led to a "strong increase" in authorisations which increased by 40 per cent in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the international classic car fair is held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.
This event will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Casa de Campo Casa de Cristal in Madrid.
In this case, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will carry out their brands on an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres.
This includes not only classic motor vehicles and vehicles, but also all thoughts items in relation to the world of motors in the ClassicAuto Madrid.
In this way you can find the exhibitors on the exhibition accessories, spare parts, components, ingredients accessories, accessories, publications, miniuratos, etc.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classical motors, which are admired by collectors and lovers.
Among the companies participating in this show, among others are Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-France Pueche, sales and restoration of cars, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Affiliation tests in the field
In addition, the sales activities at this fair will be complemented by parallel events: fairings, sports car exhibitions, skill testing, events and competitions.
It will also be performed with classic cars and motorcycles on a self-contained train track in the upper part of the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-stop: Environmentally competitive sport
Mazda would like to prove that sports is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, which is based on the name i-stop, which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazda 3 is preceded by its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its violent behaviour, the mechanism, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
At the front seats it can be found that the previous seats provide excellent ergonomics and good standing.
In addition, the game of the lens is excellent.
In further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument table and armature board, it can be found that Mazda, with a number of buttons and buttons in the visible colors, is red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend to a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, are superior to the density of the German car, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which wants to overcome all of them.
The trainway of these two Japanese compact vehicles offers more than the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive more easily with the car.
To all of this, there is a large, clear-formed coffee room.
The stop and drive system is currently only available for the 2 litres of petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-inch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It comes first by its niceness, by its reading noise, its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who drive not many kilometers a year should take into account this i-stop with petrol engine because of its grave comfort in driving and its low consumption, even though in Mazda, in particular the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called model sportive is a special feature chosen for the test, since it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The series of equipment consists mainly of the driver switching assistant (RVM), which removes the dead angle, but also the operating elements for the traction and stability, the speed adjustment, the light-saving interior mirror, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors to park, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and the damaged 17-inch wings.
Furthermore, this version also includes, if it is not yet available, the premium package, which contains additional 1,500 euros: in addition to the additional elements, especially the learning bixenon scanners and the sound system BOSE with CD loaders.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in his class.
He is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to his driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not return many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative of this model, however, is a slightly higher price, which is between EUR 21.770 for the model Luxury and EUR 23.270 for the tested model sportive.
However, compared to this high price, Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest pass.
A premium with a lot of glamour
L. A. rotates the red touch of the sensitivity for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiums of "Nine" the stars were shot, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, chose for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPiek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read its emails, without having an opportunity to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of space when it chose the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It's more unlikely to see the tragedy, but the idea of itself is nevertheless especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very valuable flatrate, for example only half the price of a iPhone flatrate.
After the company has seen the success, two new devices have been placed on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a live-time free service for data, in contrast to Peek, where a six-fold higher price is to be paid.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this finding and therefore its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American opponent, however, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for Europe as a whole.
Those who travel with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to forget all the data to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the country border or if you are looking for a coffee with WIFI (or a connection with a background).
The idea of rooming with flatrate is incredible and should actually be possible for a long time.
It has already been agreed that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign content, but my experience has already required a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission in relation to sufficient roaming rates for Europe as a whole is almost always ignored.
Over the country itself, there is always a fear of reading his e-mail and right.
That a small device such as FonPiek (where it is always amazing that it has the name of the Fund, although it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of fees, means that the telephone providers need to think slowly, but certainly and start taking into account different possibilities for using their network.
Childle is another good example of this, in its prices the download of books and other questions on the Internet is included.
No vetrag and no hacks.
This is a device that is available on the Internet and only once a month is paid for it, i.e. when buying, not for a month.
And that's exactly what I'm waiting for a day of FonPeek, a shopping opportunity with a long-term Internet access like it already offers the Peek in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for consumers.
It would be interesting, however, to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Gelb is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at the office of Barack Obama as president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a dress of this color and has again chosen to accompany him at his most important moment in his life: the surrender of the peace Prize in Oslo.
Michele Obama has carried very similar models at both stages: above all, it was almost the same color - a bright green -, the clothing was made of three parts - dress, jacket and mantel from the same fabric, and to this end she carried something gravely cut or a stick.
It goes even as far as at first sight it seemed that the first Lady of the United States wanted to follow the image of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ very much in the fabric from which they are made.
At the entrance of the office, they wore a dress of spits and an embossed seed in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with semi-sounds and the second time a low model, but gold colors.
Also the hair was different: the hair was high at this occasion as hair-kranzen, and the hair was opened before it.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who want children.
As a result, the study carried out by CSC in collaboration with the Institute for Women, "Furtherability and careers of Women in Spain".
The question of women between 15 and 75 years of age is no doubt: 75% of women employed see their career opportunities in the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are serious differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children is given, whether women work or not and whether or not they are employed.
Those of them who do not perform any other work outside the house, work only for half a day or have no fixed employment contracts will be more mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women with a firm attitude, especially in the public area, are divided into families and mothers and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group from 35 to 49 years of age with fixed employment received their first child in the middle only 3.7 years after the combination, an increase of 4.1 years for women with fixed employment, who have spent longer, have achieved this and who have joined them and the first child have achieved much later.
Moreover, the nature of work also has a serious impact on maternity, even if it is less than the calendar regarding the availability of reception," explains CSC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account when women's age at the age of marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is much higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be established in women's age.
For example, women in the group were given between 35 and 49 years of age, every time they had only primary education or higher education, averaged 25.1 or 32.1 per mother for the first time.
In addition, according to their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main closure have already married before their first pregnancy and have received their first child, it makes the women with a middle or high school degree quite different from themselves and seek first a stay and then get their first child, Delgado finds.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actor will be the image of different products of the brand and also the popular advertising review "If you are worth it" will say.
The main producer of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant players at international level, will become an even more famous figure as has already been seen before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before you were the last to join this exclusive club, the players Evangeline Lilly ("lost") and Frieda Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire") were the players.
In the males, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional stores: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (play fellows of Evangeline in "Last").
The price allocation of the British fashion industry
The British have an important role to play in the model world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - meet the annual price award held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
At this point they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents him in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, photos of Fernando Vicente) to the three-dimensional drawings of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He uses no predictable and imaginative genes (curzbiography, life and work), but is looking for a possibility of the happy heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicen neither spart nor explanations.
The fact that this book is a cost-effective reading is also an incentive to read and read again.
Here are some chapters from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is no longer a sea, but more a spiritual, almost meaningful trip, just as I have always found it, without finding words: the joys in contrast to the insatiable destiny, the moral without guilt and the innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihiliist, allegorical Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, had, between weakness and ignorance, with a round-up poetic humor, without any sense, like the mercureans who had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was brought into his arms for thirty years by this woman with suffering, but in her flesh the emotions were united with the joy of the river, a spiritual privilege that was in it to come into heaven on the side of the torment."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseau" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is about one of the 8000 peaks in the world's literature, and one has to climb north, on the wall, where the best mountain climbers ever try again."
About William Faulkner: "There was a Communist cause.
Sometimes he said about himself that he would inherit a good owner of the graveyard and again he said that he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams testify to a certain grave."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took on the vehement step that was taken from a bridge from his personality from Munich to the night of the 20th century, so that his echo became deeply rooted in his literary nature and ways. This made him, when he was on his own trip, and with a speech, completely violent before the Urmers.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she fell down and prayed: my dear God, I beg you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are buried by Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the wind of the port,/ the peace after the war,/ after a set of lives, there is death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her bag.
The husband took it with absolute normality when she told him that Edward VII had spyed them out between the Azalenes or sang the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and loved in a neurotic, whose literary talent was still much grayer than their apostasy."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos do to try to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What would be the point if he didn't bring Baroja into the arms of Faulkner?
So what did Cela do to destroy the peace of that man so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went to spend the last week in our village of Fuenlabrada, where suddenly a group of young people from 15 to 18 years of age lived beside her and our dog, our dog is a mess that we've been holding from the animal, which is just six kilos, and then from here they took him two feet and injured him hard.
We can't even take our equipment in words, because it's incomprehensible to us, because there's to be the spaspas at a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was obviously executed on the lion.
This is also the case of abortion, which came to a woman who went to rest, when she wanted to justify these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a dog is attacked by a dog, she may also be with a woman, a child, an older master or perhaps even anyone who is weaker than herself.
The event occurred in a normal quiet city district about five hours a day at a very regular service day.
The dog's been lucky all day.
Of course, we have replaced in a nearby police service, but we have strong doubts about whether this will be done at all and in order to prevent any benefits from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the poor criminals were Spain.
Our argument about the incident has forced us to show this case.
We cannot understand what must occur in the heads of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect have remained with animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvil together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the railway manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially in younger motorists, as both companies have known today.
This initiative will therefore focus on the importance of helmet usage, as it ultimately deals with the only protection element, which can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motor crash.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign represents part of its commitment to transport security, which "is far more comprehensive than the design and production of products that will always be safer with each day" and further confirmed that they also contribute to the development of pedagogical and informative characters to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, running under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will be distributed in a first phase on more than 500 motorcycle stations to achieve the best possible expansion.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that transport security is "a constant concern" of the company, and just because they are constantly obliged to see themselves as manufacturers of tyres for two-way vehicles, one of their main objectives must be the development of safer products.
The sale of small cargo vehicles increases something again
After almost two years, the automotive market for small carriers finally begins to see something light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles allowed in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in terms of 2008 and, more importantly, they are, after the first increase, 22 consecutive months with a steady decline due to the figures presented by the manufacturer’s Amfac and the car dealer’s bond with Ganvam.
However, these good figures are only to be taken seriously at the time, since the reference data referred to in comparison from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year with a decline of 60% in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total allowances for these 11 months are still 40 % below the sales figures of the previous marketing year.
Since January all 95.853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles from which the small transporter market consists are included: trailers of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vehicles and light passenger cars/roads.
Furthermore, there are still the same cold clouds in the sky, which most demand for membership, because even if some of the vehicles of private persons are purchased, the bulk of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that operate in almost 100 % of all cases the purchase with a third financing.
In this way, these restrictions, which are the consequences of the financial burden imposed by credit institutions, must include other factors such as the increase in unemployment rate or the increase in the poor economy.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has contributed little to the purchase of a vehicle in the plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only for private persons, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they want to buy a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 output that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre per dangerous kilometre, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Yesterday, Ganvam had recalled that it was absolutely necessary for the state to also pay special attention to this small cargo and, of course, also to the industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Autohandling Group predicts a similar year for 2010 to the same year as it was just lasted, for which 19 % is calculated by a sales accident (in the case of passenger cars and land vehicles).
Support in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-block brake system and as with the ESP's stability control now, the aid systems need to be equipped with a load load in the European cars in cases of emergency.
In fact, they are already obliged for all new authorised passenger cars and light small carriers, for the rest of the vehicles a driving deadline has been set by the end of February 2011.
The European Union's main objective is to improve the protection of foot-and-mouth disease, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many seizures due to their working methods.
The task of the brake assistant is to use more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake handle, which the system recognises by means of the brake force performed by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not end this pressure.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers in an accident were no longer able to get on the brake pedal and half of them had not broken out with full force.
Up to 1.100 Inaccuracies
On the other hand, the brake support reaches with maximum power in the brake system and thus reduces the brake time and therefore also the brake distance that a car returns to the brake process.
According to a EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents resulting from injuries could be prevented if all cars with this type of emergency assistance were equipped.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (on radar or a camera) obstacles and alerts the driver, where at the same time it has a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts to this, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the combination is already inevitable, the brake assistant uses the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible in this way.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the company of the Opel works in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer indicates that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants to make it clear that the parties concerned already agree on each of the individual points of the plan.
And for this reason, it can be that the final document, which first appeared to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there is work, will be presented before the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, the GM will ensure that a decision will be taken on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on American car manufacturers to make this decision as soon as possible.
GM has to be in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's option of the Skyper Sports Car, which has been confirmed by the Russian Converg group, has always been stronger demand.
If it was not agreed with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to make Saab end of the year, if it has not been sold so far, will continue to be maintained.
At the Price of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewellery, engineers used the boxer S as the basis and actually made it easier for him to make 80 kilos, with which he now only weighs 1.275 kilos.
In order to create something like this, they failed as first on the automatic applicable roof, which was replaced by a cell wall with a manual drive, so that 21 kilos were individually shared; thanks to the aluminium tubes used in this model, such as the GT3 "remove" 15 more; by the removal of the climate system, the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so that another 7 kilos were added; by the installation of sports backquet sites, 12 times, and five times with the light 19-inch fields.
Then there were also six kilos in the CDR-30 audio system, and the missing kilo was achieved through the exchange of the villages by tapping from the contents.
Although he is also available with the double-cold PDK, the test was carried out with a vehicle with 6-fold handrails, mainly on the smaller rurals of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curved.
In the course of his driving, he can only be given the notes without saying.
The reduction of his weight, however, has never led him to do so now that he would no longer be so sure of the threat.
It is more the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, which at the same time also gives a sense of grave security at the curves, even at high speed.
He's a little athlet, so he's able to warm his muscles at a low time, until we give him the orders to get up, get up, get up and then get everything out of his car again...
He's doing everything he's told. The car does everything we can with our hands on the rail, thanks to his link, which is both communicative and precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the boxer S) has been reached and you can still raise it with the 'port' option as well as with a system that can change engine noises, which has already been used for the first time in Panama.
The speeding capacity is unlikely to be brutal, regardless of whether it comes out of the stage or when it is renewed.
The federations are strong, but not hard or inconceivable.
The asphal on the landslides on which we went with the boxer Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car was well-increased.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole street; and this, although we found some of these Eis curves in the morning and roll across the morning.
In summary, you can say that it's an ultrasound car, a car with which you have an undefinable driving pass, as if it were rather rare and there's much more in it than just a small improvement of the boxer Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70.831.
Bag Girl
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon Cocoon cosmetics and an opportunity for the fashions of 'maison', she presents her bad face with the same neck strength as her bag of channel.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia itself is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated a magnificent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electric and thus came to the first place within his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight three of his best men (29 at the evaluation).
The men of Vitoria were able to replace the significant cases of Herrmann, Olison, Huertas or Mikov by a severe dose of use and teamwork, even though they had to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triangles are likely to contribute to their final victory.
The game started with the lead of the flowers that were placed at the top of the display table from the beginning.
Since the first four bodies of the man from Vitoria were already out of the perimeter, they could already have found out that they had come to the game field with well-heated hand links.
It was English and Teletovic, who were primarily responsible for the 18-20s at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, just that the man from Álava chose himself for an inside-page game of Barac and for the game of Eliahu, who was received on his return to the man with pfifen and applaus, which is his home to build up his advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight himself as his best man with 13 points, even though the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter has already begun that this would not be the best night of the Brazilians.
Nevertheless, the game was not yet determined despite the significant advantage in the break, and the Maccabees wanted the Victorians to remember once again that they won not everyone in their field, and thanks to the ever-increasing "hand of Elijah" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini strongly support the "Gelbens" turning the wheel (50-49).

The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all other than until, had to prepare a few toys with a chance to get back to the air and suddenly came to Mirza Teletovic's gun, which provided for three almost consecutive steps and the support of English and Ribas to show the back-up distance from (54-67) that the guests could break at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
In the last quarter, the Alavians were bloated and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to give them the victory they had truly deserved in the first three minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, who did not try their best and tried to give their men back three points from the line (70-77).
Despite the fact that the team of Ivanovic did not stand up, and even though split up because of the fall, the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Damages prevented Unicaja from being ordered the stars
Unicaja lost his voice in Greece against Olympics and had to take the lead in Eurolegic Group B, which in a game that was marked by the events from the players in Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made Greece easier to win.
The man from Málaga was neither afraid of the vote in the Hall of Peace nor of the opposite man who may be one of Europe's strongest men and who has a lot of money.
The Andalusiers were able to sleep in the first quarter of their presents. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triphase, two of which were by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, mixed the guests with 12-18 in the 9 minutes.
Olympicos was surprised by the intensity of the unicaja era, even though the local man with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis created that the display table in the 13th minute 22-20 was shown to his well-being, the minutes in which it would have come almost to strike between the two American Beverley and Williams and were both disqualified on the way.
The Greek team started to get hot at last and to rely on two toys, while the separation of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three errors caused by Carlos Jiménez were the result of the major failures of Unicaja.
Among her players in the interior and the Lithuanian playwright, Linas Kleizas, with his trifles, they increased their advantage in the 19 minutes to 44-32.
A backup was not possible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks on the crew of Olympicos, who, despite his 19 losses, had even managed to compare the difference between the game released in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27 minutes, which resulted in the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to move over the many accidents and the disappearance of the wounded shot Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many nights for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the federation and the three phases of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was hope again at 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was really impossible that the Olympics, as soon as he attacked and showed up with centimetres within the corps, was not too slow.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic created it in 37 minutes to raise the corb difference to 81-62, and Unicaja had to fight and take the lead on Olympics.

The "How many should you deserve?" tool calculates the user's worth of more than 120,000 jobs available in Trovit in Spain. The user is available on Facebook, where they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and city where they work.
Already a week after the application was first made available, the search engine found that the Spanish employee in the medium "feels bad" explained in a press release for the product Trovit Responsible Albert Ribera.
The Spaniards are the worst paid in terms of the data available on the Trovit by its search engines in the United Kingdom and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross amount of EUR 45.226 and a French 31.059, compared to the EUR 24,000 worth of Spain.
As a result, a Lkw driver has an annual net content of EUR 34.247 in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.

In Brazil, Zelaya calls a date to be left
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her mission in Tegucigalpa.
The Under-President of the Office must leave the diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010 when his term of office expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian message in the capital of Honduras, confirmed TV Globo that "Mel" was a woman who had to leave the message he had found since September 21st.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27th, since his mission is running this day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The sender also invited the ex-Presidents, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the deadline set, "My position is, as soon as possible, to go logically with the return of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the election on 29 November (with Porfirio Lobo as a winner) Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to get a visit to Brazil this week.
However, this differed from Zelayas' refusal to recognize the status of an asylum seeker who wanted to establish the "the fact" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the most exciting days since last spring, in which the inflation of the assets was the prevailing vote on the markets, the uncertainty has again returned to the markets, which is not surprising, since this is her natural state, in a environment where the makers make decisions about a future of nature that is uncertain.
The profit used to stabilize the markets was to compare the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to allow the liquidity to be indirectly free of interest, which move towards zero to buy assets in this way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as they are and, without their heterodox policy on liquidity, start to throw some sand into the pipeline, as the ECB has recently made with its annual enlargement, which will take place next week.
Therefore, the investors are convinced that the world economy is capable of maintaining economic recovery without these heterodox mavnia, and we are just going to be witnesses of a change in the reduction of risk premiums.
The refugees of the boroughs and the differences with the companies are growing again, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The countries were forced to recognize the private risks and the public debt increased again.
It is now based on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred resort of investors, which again leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries in Germany.
Spain has not yet been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and started with a new revision below with regard to Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that the defenders of moral risks who have tried again to raise awareness about what they had caused, as they had broken down the terrible effects of the restrictions on the loss of jobs if they had actually decided a new day of gratitude.
In other words, what is happening in Dubai is a tribal war between the emiries to restore power in the emeries and development in Greece has already been foreseen.
A government that removes the debt of the state, elections and a new government that holds the same strike.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense that Ecofin Hungary will start the year from non-compliance with its foreign payments and therefore join a Euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to assume its citizens with the necessity of excessive deficits in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are in expectation of an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some transfers to high amounts, it would now be within the expectations.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry, as long as the differences in the debt are increased with the same speed as the European corporate bonds.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and Spain would continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a step. While these indicators require a large part of the market research institutes to provide their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which will meet again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all the warnings do not guarantee long life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment of the "Warning on the Road" has been said.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, is discussing the strategy for the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
Following his presentation by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some insights on what he had done behind the closed doors of the Sub-Committee.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest EUR 50 billion more from this date to 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investments needed would not be made to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it should no longer be invested in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international links.
Since 2020 the question will be changed and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities to start carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it follows that 18,000 MW will be needed, under the provision of other "supportive energy".
Galán, who is of the opinion that the draft legislation for a sustainable economy that was just adopted by the government, was on a line with what his company called for, did not want to say in any case anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in combating climate change.
In his opinion, it was "set a long time ago clearly on this direction, despite some" alone, as she referred to the president of Iberdrola.
As it is, Galán believes that the decisions on investment should be made now, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable compensation framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Switzerland Switzerland, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the package service at ten European airports to which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The Agreement, which has not yet been notified, has been concluded for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Union is planning investments of 20 million to 2012 from 50% of which are generated by Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the survey of energy efficiency on cars and airports.
Akiona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first car construction in Australia
Akiona is fighting for the approval of its first bus in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction that it is doing is a tunnel, which will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about EUR 1,047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German noblemen are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Actiona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and car operators.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration of public-private cooperation (PPP is the English deduction) has decided to proceed to the project in accordance with a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the management is already in possession of a complete list of candidates for construction and construction management.
In the wake of the tenders presented in May, the estimated investments amounted to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three concerts, mainly from European construction companies, competed together in the last phase.
The group named Transcity is named after Akiona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghela.
The first company is one of Australia's major construction companies, while the second with its seat in Italy is one of the best specialists for deep construction.
The Consortium Northern Direct, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructures and the French Bouygues.
The third and last concert, which is in the lower election, is called LBRJV, composed of the capital of the Australian Leighton (the daughter company of the German construction company, which is again part of the ACS), the domestic Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which has specialized in the public building.
The Australian infrastructure market, however, promises strong construction work and privatizations, has a debt which is worth overcoming because it is only through the purchase of a domestic construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the so-called high-level or bilfinger companies, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by Spanish builders.
Even ACS has only obtained access to this market through its participation of 30% at the height, owner of the so-called Lighton.
Millions of Active
Action is of the highest importance in this geographical area for the sector, which is already well known for its activity as energy provider and in the decommissioning industry.
In addition, it already has its huge windmill park (102 MW) in Victoria and leads to the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s settlement facilities with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to both building and infrastructure.
The underground maut street, promoted by the city infrastructure office of Brisbane, and the North Link (Northern) has the purpose of connecting the western road to the road in Toowong with the environmental trauma in Kelvin Grove (see map) to a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels. It is about the grave mavnament of stauerudization on the streets of Brisbane.
The road plan issued by the city administration is the year ahead of the year 2010 and the start of the construction work in December.
Even if this road is already open for transport in the last months of 2014, it is clear that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two routes in each direction, an electronic system of measurement and a complex discharge system.
The government of Queensland is involved in financing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is already a big business for the top.
Australia grants to the High Representative, who signed a contract with the Government in a total of 154 million yesterdays, again and again significant contracts.
The share company ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass cable through its domestic subsidiary Lighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and the German company will work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower construction project with 27 stocks in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not started yet, and has received a peak of 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke about the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investments amounted to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has taken over its subsidiary Alpine, which has built a tunnel over 2.1 km long for a bus in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the proposal for the construction of the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine enhances its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has written advertising and marketing services for the next two years by Sra. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros per year, sharing the railway company.
This agreement also provides for two extensions of each 12 months. Ms. Rushmore was elected from among 16 agencies representing this competition written by Renfe, of which 4 came to the end, among them TBWA, which was responsible for the publication in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
More than 63 million fines for France Télécom due to the distortion of competition.
France Télécom, the regulatory authority for competition in France, imposed a fine of over EUR 63 million due to anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions in the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has limited competition in fixed networks and telephones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and trust programmes for consumers at the regulatory level.
Together with this sanctions, the former French monopol and still state-owned companies have collected more than EUR 560 million in criminal proceedings since 1994 because of the opposition of their competitors.
The punishment imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority waiting for competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar losses in the past and has therefore become renegotiated.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application website for an increase in the revenue from business that does not result from the telephone connection.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You must wait until 2010 until this site is available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the League Championships has been introduced by Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The League's Championships has developed since its beginning in 1992 as an input source for the Fuvball Club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned most of the money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The UEFA's League champions do not only bring peace with themselves. It is also one of the main sources of the great unity.
According to UEFA, up to EUR 5,362.5 million has been distributed to 105 (from 12 Spanish) people who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The women's club is in third place of Europe, which has earned most of the money through its participation and the only one that has won three times the trophies in addition to the AC Milan.
The fifth place is the leading Catalan master and last winner of the former European Cup 1992.
The lists lead to Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two men who also took part in most of the money by participating in the previous Champoins League.
And even though they've lost them against Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only a third of the countries that were able to earn money by the champions, although it has more title than all others (five, in contrast to four, Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This apparent objection is expressed by the complex financial allocation procedure used by UEFA.
In this business year, the organization in which President Michel Platini is involved accounts for 1,090 million entries by the League champions.
From this money, UEFA 413.1 million is expected for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualification courses (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for a share of 3,8 million by their blue presence were added to the EUR 550,000 for each game they fight.
There is also a bonus for winning (EUR 800,000) and for a discount (400,000 per man). The clubs that have reached the east end receive three million each; the four that have reached the fourth finals are 3.3 million.
The last four received 4 million each.
The winner deserves 9 million, in contrast to the second one, which is 5.2 million.
A football club thus achieves at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed revenue.
With his victory at the European Supercup in August 2,5 million.
However, there are also the variable payments for the 337,8 million.
This money is distributed proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 assigned places.
In the last year, the master receives 40% of the assigned money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is divided by the number of games they play in this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29,9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has been able to secure details of the purchase offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire an upper limit between 25 and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage which is not required to make a public statement (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share paid for 10 years and with a interest rate of 1 % per year due to this disbursement.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended with EUR 1,85, so Nueva Rumasa assessed the company’s market value by 18%.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jerez has a 15-day period for shareholders to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CMMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateas confirmed that it had been contacted with the authority.
At a conclusion, the payment would run at 611.7 million, while the value of Sos 254.27 million would be.
In the meantime, it continues to structure its business.
When trying to stay at the edge of possible purchases and the legal roots of his ex-manager, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as leader of the internal library.
A decision to make for the first woman who has a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created post that is directly supported by the Chairman of the Group.
This is all different than the freedom of Polish, because the company has developed in a legal battle due to the suspicion of joining more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that, in the next month, more capital will be transferred.
In view of the Salazar loan yesterday, the ex-brothers Ildefonso Ortega and Ániel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) presented themselves before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the distribution of 212 million without their determination.
CMMV approves the public statement submitted by the investment company Mer by Paterinina
The National Committee of Beverages (CNMV) approved the public statement submitted by Mer by the Investment Company on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this statement after it had been proved that the conditions of the law are in conformity with it and therefore the content of the proposed statement can be considered as "extensive" in the light of the amendments made by the last 2 December.
CMMV has also announced that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares by Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 Euro per share, which is again 8.95 % of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euro in the pools of Madrid and Bilbao.
In addition, 5,592,778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred until the end of the tender, and their price has been determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legal provisions.
New vehicle maintenance programmes
In these days of weather and accidents, only KFZ works
Every day thousands of vehicles developed in an accident will be placed in the workplaces where a customer needs to assess the damages and costs of repair.
No single accident is the same and the calculation of the costs for parts and hours of work can be a long-term and complex task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
Nevertheless, with the support of the latest IT tools, it is a question of minutes.
Therefore, almost 100% of customers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them and provide them with their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audadex is part of the American group Solera, the market leader; 80% of all households are created with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for the recognition and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturer is all but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audadex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together with each of them providing information in another format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is always worse, until the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market in the last five years than in the entire five years.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the job begins for companies.
It is an important task, because each of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catalysed and their price entered.
In addition, each model will create an "intelligent" graphics image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a very sold model, the work can be completed within a week if the procedure is in progress.
If it's a less expensive car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audadex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain for full information.
Among the exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
It is over 99 % in view of the vehicle park running on the tracks.
For the purposes of the implementation of documentation and the production of databases, Audadex has worldwide over eight centres (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There are more than a hundred technicians working simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audadex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they take 2.5 million data and their customers get updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use them in various ways and thereby offer different products.
