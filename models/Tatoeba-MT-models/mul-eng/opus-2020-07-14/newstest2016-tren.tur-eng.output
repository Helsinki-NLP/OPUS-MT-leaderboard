Recognizing that Professor 911 killed a girl's friend
Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, said that the police had shot his girlfriend and that the police had to come home.
Lamb indicated that the "lovely dog" is alive and probably sad and that the dead woman's family's phones can be found on her cell phone.
Police found Amy Prentiss' body at home and a note written in a white note, "I'm sorry, if I could bring everything back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman to love me."
There was no evidence that Lamb, who had been trained by two translators for the University of Delta in Cleveland, thought the police's favorite historian, Ethan Schmidt, had been shot and killed in front of the Lamb's office.
Delta State police chief Lynn Buford said his staff were shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He also indicated that Lamb had made 911 calls shortly thereafter.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb, the police came near him.
One day after the students and professors of the school shooting were trying to find out what Lamb was still doing.
In both sides of the region, there was a well-known but probably a teacher's picture of what students and staff were doing with him.
The students said they were waiting for him to get in.
A police officer in Gautier that Prentiss died said there was no record of the crime and reputation.
Even Schmidt, in a book he wrote, spoke as one of the "humans" who shared his academic life with Lamb.
They both studied at the Social Sciences and History Department, which is a member of the 17th class, and they received a lot of education from both of them.
Along with this, there were signs of spiritual problems.
He told students about the Lamb that Brandon Beavers was a very worried and nervous person and that he seemed "like he had a problem."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb himself said that he was under stress at the end of the 2014-15 year.
She asked for permission from Delta State University to state that she had some health problems before.
This year, he was just giving two lessons from the Internet.
The recent changes in university employment policies did not ensure that the doctor who worked hard to win Lamb's degree was automatically a member of the framework.
Professor William LaForge of the University said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said, "We know there are some things in Lamb's mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't prove anymore.
After the camp was canceled, the police took him on his way to Mississippi from Arkansas to the police station.
The Washington County Adli Investigation Manager, Methel Johnson, whose family found a house in Mississippi, Greenville, about 1.5 km away from the back of a house, explained that he had only 38 calibrated guns before he was arrested by Lamb.
The Lamb's car was working in the car.
Although the Lamb was not immediately identified why he went to this house, Johnson indicated that he believed that Lamb knew those who lived in this house.
The Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at 3,500 university students in the city of about 12,000 in the city in 2009, providing education and training.
At first, he took his doctorate in the field of education.
One of Lamb's old friends identified him as a smart, charismatic and fun man.
Carla Hairston said when she met her partner's fianc√©e, she said she had 15, Lamb at the age of 20.
Carla was in high school with her friends, and Lamb was a very nice person who tried to learn to play guitar for a few years.
At that time, he was a fast-paced man.
Hairston, now in his early 40s, who lives in Jackson's bathroom in Brandon, said to Lamb, "When he came, all the girls were mad."
Lamb and Prentiss were known to have been together for a while.
There's no record of their marriage if Lamb said "I killed my brother" at 911.
There were dogs in the house in the cave on the edge of a lake in Gautier, where they lived with them, named Lightning.
The police said the dog's condition was good.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they were divorced 15 years ago, but they're always friends with Prentiss and now they're a 19-year-old girl.
He also indicated that O'Steen's daughter was in a completely broken state.
He and his mother were great friends.
She said she never met O'Steen Lamb, but she said she heard that she was interested in Abigail's music and that she stole the blues.
They met Prentiss, three years ago, when they met him at a writing festival with Lamb and Abigail.
Then Lamb and Abigail were played together in public shows.
O'Steen said she wrote her daughter's music and said it.
Prentiss was a surgeon who worked in various translation companies.
Mike Shaffer, who was a member of the jury's party at The Julep Room, said that he had seen the last 5 months of his visit to the smallest number of viewers and the music.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we cut and sold one another.
They both had a great deal of understanding.
Professor Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at the same university, pointed out that Professor Schmidt, who was killed, managed the first-class seminar program and was an expert in American local and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of a team of students who formed it.
On Saturday night at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including academics, university employees, students and visitors from local communities were included in the same survey.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother Jeff Schmidt, were also involved in the celebration of the "Montenegro Star" and "Great Zarafet" songs at the university.
Classes continue Wednesday.
LaForge said, "We're trying to bring our students back."
It's the middle of the day.
It's time to clean up the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans) were present.
This message was corrected in the form of a formal proof that Lamb was calling 911 after he killed Schmidt, and that Lamb's 911 call referred to him as Prentiss, although there was no official evidence that both of them were married.
Toys R Usus Plans to Take Action
Toys R Us explained that he would not be able to take over the harvest season this year, but he indicated that he would be more aware of the potential for work for players and baby products companies and seasonal workers.
The company indicated that 40,000 people were planning to work in the state-run store and district centres, and this figure was 45,000 in the 2014 season.
Most of the work will be half-time.
The company indicated that the negotiations with the authorities would begin in this month and that the number of personnel would increase from Ekim to the Middle East.
Even though it's been months longer, it's getting closer to the satellite shopping season, and companies are ready to take on temporary jobs that will help them sell, send and distribute their stores.
Michael J. Fox, Princes Diana and Princes, made the Esprites about "Agreement"
It's a very important name for Michael J. Fox, the film's last name.
It was also important for personal reasons.
He explained in the documentary Back in Time's fragment, which will take place in the new vision: "We were waiting for the members of the Kingdom family sitting in my room to come and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I realized that the Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The film began, and I realized that I was in the middle of a false dream and a wave of rage.
Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, a documentary on the "Return" film, contains reports from Robert Zemeckis and application maker Steven Spielberg.
He first came back to the scene 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time of travel for me so far."
Back in Time Vod and DVD formats will be shown in some of the selected movies.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Regarding Russia's continued support for Syria, General Secretary Ban Ki-moon said that the problem of Syria would not be solved with military defence for about five years and that more than one million people would be more violent and painful.
The BM Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the BM Security Council, to meet together to find a political solution.
Ban stated that five permanent council members were planning to meet Syria with outsiders from the United States, China, Russia, England and France at a press conference scheduled for the end of the month.
The Council members and the people of Syria expressed their deep regret that the division between the people of Syria was "unsolved by the regional forces."
Ban invited five permanent members to join in the Syrian crisis as it was in the Iranian nuclear agreement.
An 8-in-a-Row display of Donald Trump
Some tried to label him as a healer.
The others seemed to be laughing at him.
And he's supporting some of them to smoke.
Although some of the community members tried to get Donald Trump down in the polls, that's not what they did.
The last 11 national polls showed him the superiority of Donald Trump in double numbers, and some began to question the chance of the real estate emperor.
Of course, you're still early in your selection.
None of this means that Trump can win the civil war.
In 2011, the passengers were explaining why Rick Perry's height was too high for Herman Cain, and both didn't even win the chance of getting up in one instance.
And there's a lot of reason to live in my general election.
But Jeb Bush's Super PAC Group and the Great Group of Economic notaries, such as the Great Club, are aware of the lasting power of Trump and are beginning to spend their dollars to reverse it.
Here are some recent polls that show that the real estate agent is only coming and not too late:
Trump's preferences changed 180 degrees.
A survey conducted in Monmouth University shortly before the mid-months of Donald Trump showed that the two of them had the status of the property emperor.
It was about 40 percent in the middle of the month of December.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Now he's got a chance to see the bottom of the community about Donald Trump.
He means he's been missing three of the 10.
And these numbers look high in early universes.
Last week, Iowa, a poll in Quinnipiac showed that 60 percent of the citizens in the community preferred Donald Trump.
The three GOP voters can be pleased with the Trump name.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the community members said they'd be "stupid" or "tamin".
Only two of the 10 people said they're going to fall if that's a sign.
Only Ben Carson Trump creates a match at the same level (40 percent for Trump when he says they're going to be "cooper" in 43 percent).
The closest person to the kiss?
Only 21 percent with Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the community's voters, if there's a Jeb Bush, the company's favorite, they're not going to be mine, or they're going to die.
Most of the community doesn't see the essence of Trump as a problem.
Donald Trump thinks that the U.S. news/ Washington Post polls have the right role for 52 percent of the citizens who are asked to be the president of the real emperor.
The same number is true in Iowa, where the first party organization of the country is held, and according to Quinnipac last week, 52 percent of the citizens believe that they have the leadership of the community.
He still believes that 44 persons do not have an active person to serve, and according to the U.S./Post, he says 10 people do not follow his lead in the White Saray.
Community voters are starting to deal with this idea.
The presidents of the community think that the Trump is serious in terms of their policies.
According to a CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, when asked who was the best leader of the GOP to win the GOP, he said it was the best of every 10 people.
I'm another change since the end of the month of Tammuz that four of them spent their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete explanation: In the past, the crystal system of GOP voters was not very clean.
At the last election in that period, he thought that there would be a sign for Rick Perry, the last of which he had chosen Mitt Romney, the last 28 percent.
The majority of GOP voters still appear to have been caught up in Trump's election campaign.
Even if the community members gather around another ad, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts also point out that the mountainous region can be found in the field to advance Trump and that it has been divided between more and more than one degree of support for Trump.
However, a Monmouth University survey conducted at the beginning of the month shows that in a case of a conflict between Trump and many Communicating Aid, Trump received support from the majority in each case.
Carly Fiorina with 13 pounds, Marco Rubio with 14 pounds, Walker with 15 pounds, Jeb Bush with 19 pounds and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 pounds.
With Ted Cruz.
The only day you're gonna wake him up?
Ben Carson's working at 19 pounds in case he's in charge.
Donald Trump says most supporters have made decisions.
A new CBS/NYT report published on Tuesday shows that more than half of the voters supported the Trump.
Obviously, many things can happen to change this, and no one can really change his mind.
He said they left the door open to change 46 percent.
The biggest brain brain surgeon in Trump is Ben Carson, but the voters who say they're making their decisions are twice as close to using the game for Trump.
10 of the community says it's the same idea as Trump.
Two months before the campaign was launched, Donald Trump had been moved to the beginning of the 2016 talks and to the middle of the city.
Some think that the important Hispanic election of Trump's speech has distanced themselves from the Communist Party and will damage their re-marketing efforts.
However, according to a new ABC/Post report made on Friday, it is said that it is the same with Trump in matters of movement under the 10 community.
So it looks like Trump will stay in my day as long as it's in my day.
The interest that is heard in the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are taking half of the community games because of the situation outside of the big city.
In a new ABC/Post report on Wednesday, it says that every 10 community members want someone out of the country who has tried to try.
And they're mad at Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Blomberg poll in Iowa showed that every third of the community's community members in Iowa had been subjected to ‚Äúno violence‚Äù by 54 percent, and 21 percent were ‚Äúseverely angry‚Äù.
The boss's questions are going to Jeremy Corby's for the first time
Since the day he was selected, Mr. Corbyn has been waiting for the President to appear in the Question Program.
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will go to the summit after David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will be asking six questions shortly after the meeting, and his performance is like an intelligible by the media and the Labour Party.
She called "a little less theater and more real" in a week.
He also said he could get some seats and leave them with his colleagues.
This confrontation will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, his father's office of the island and his speech at the TUC annual conference on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the director of the Labour Party was also silenced by some of the Tory Milletvellians and in the front of the press, in the memory of the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the English War.
Mr Corbyn has taken note of the decision to join the military march.
A speaker speaking on behalf of Mr. Corbyn said that he stood in the "failure of silence" and that "the King of the Empire's Air Force" recognized the military in the War of England.
However, Mr. Corbyn, a member of the shadow leader of Mr. Corbyn, said that he would advise the Director of the Working Party, when Owen Smith BBC, one of the members of the Board of Directors, has made the announcement that he would say a thousand march in the middle of the monarchy.
When he refused to serve on the top of his team, Mr Corbyn, who refused to serve on the ground for economic, defence and external differences, he was supported by at least one of the parliamentarians as a leader.
BBC political leader Robin Brant in the Labour Party also points out that political differences have begun to "collecte" and that these are the issues of the position of Mr Corbyn in the European Union and of the government's overarching implementation of government aid.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Working Party had made new changes in the total elimination of the upper limit.
Hours later, Mr. Smith said that the party was opposed to the fact that the government was only at the top limit of $26,000 and that it was "very open" in this regard.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader in the post of the history of David Cameron as leader of the Muhafazakar Party.
The Labour Party leader made a different statement in politics and told Mr. Cameron that he had taken more than 30,000 advice to ask Mr. Cameron.
Islington North Milletve, told the President of the University of Islington that the question programme is very appealing and will focus on the difficulties faced by young people rather than on the exchange of words with "responsibility".
Mr. Corbyn, when he wasn't his own, for example, when he went out to visit Mr. Cameron, told the Chief of the Questions programme that Angela Eagle would represent himself on the ground.
In time, other colleagues took the idea of going to this scene, and Av√°m's Camera's Dictionary said that John Bercow was involved in taking this issue into account.
When Mr. Cameron was leader in 2005, most of the time, he admitted that he wanted to get away from politics with the question-related agenda, but only a few years later, he admitted that he had failed in this regard.
Since its first edition in 1990, the Director of the Question Programme has been used as a basic measuring point to measure the ability of the leaders to decide on the question programme, the authorities of the United States of America, and the Millennium Development Goals; he has expressed his wish that some perpetrators would have done so in a spirit of crisis and that there was a need for very complex reforms.
'Joburg is out of jail': young people without a home are taking a photo training
The city centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of old street children found a way to win a new skill and get their way.
I was taken to Joburg, a studio where young homeless people can take pictures of their rooms and learn how to get them out of this.
He went to meet one of the first messages of the BBC News project.

Sterlin is rising with the speed of the United Kingdom's nuclear power surges
Following data showing increased prices in the United Kingdom, a rapid rise was observed, and FTSE rose by 100 Indians and the sales offer for SABMiller.
In the United Kingdom, other than the press, the press has recorded an increase of %2.9 over the same year between May and December.
This event, which has been described as the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the first indicators for future peaks.
Sterlin won more than $1,555 versus ‚Ç¨1,84 and won $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index increased by 6,229.21 to 6,49.
If the company is the most visible company on this scale, the company has made a 20% increase in SABMiller's sales bid for a product from the EU InBev.
This offer will unite the world's largest two-bill company and meet brands known as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The incidence of Burbery's feelings increased by %0.9 percent with the effects of the high periphery group from Richemont.
Richemont also showed that sales in China, one of the key markets for Burberry, who started to re-sale the daily sales numbers.
The financial debt of Glencore rose by 5% after explaining how she had managed to reduce the company's debt in a strategy to reduce her debt.
The feelings of the Ambab and the paper group Mondi were among the most valuable feelings of loss after Goldman Sachs gave his contribution to the "Sat" company.
JD Sports's feeling of the company grew by 46.6 million sterline, six months before it was released, and then it increased by 46.6 million steriles.
JD Sports said it could damage the pattern of higher loans
JD Sports Director, Peter Cowgill, said that the military debt for workers in England could mean "more cost-effectively in the hands of potential terrorists."
But he said that he's not going to make it on his own company's high-ranking bills.
The Marshals also added that JD Sports will influence the expansion plans and that this could mean less extra work.
Metcash launched a public campaign to fight Aldi's will
Metcash, South Australia and Western Australia are trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi attack.
Market leader Metcash, South Australia, and Western Australia launched a public campaign to defend their stores against Aldi's 700 million dollars.
Aldi, in the early years of our last year, in South Australia and Western Australia, is preparing to open two district centres and the numbers from stores to 120, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local gas dealers and try to create the IGA market with both the home and social media markets, such as the Adelaide border.
IGA dealers and contractors are also in contact with brands of Dunsborough Central Dormitory manufacturer, who is well-tested at the IGA stores, such as Simmo, and their loyal customers in South Australia football league tickets.
The G√ºda, the drinking and the drinking group of Metcash, is expected to have more details about the defence strategy during the 29th anniversary of Metcash.
The risk represents almost 30 % of the IGA store's large, remote South Australia and Western Australia Metcash's stock market and generates higher fairs than the IGA in the countries that are born in Metcash.
South Australia and West Australia store stores are more popular and IGA dealers produce a more powerful market share than they did in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; more than 30% of the GGA and more than 24% of the BA, which are visited in the Western countries.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will spend about 5% of the market market market in the next 12 months after opening the first stores in these two instances, but that the sales will generally be made by the players in the market.
In a report published this week, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, predicted that IGA's $360 million in one year, and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This suggests that Aldi will open 30 stores in the next year in GA 25 and BA and spend 500 million dollars on each market and 600 million dollars on sales.
Mr. Kierath indicated that the loss of cash and market sales and the loss of Metcash's high-performance capital tax would be worth nearly $13 million in advance of the tax to Metcash.
At the same time, Metcash, despite the recent study of Roy Morgan, who found that IGA‚Äôs clients were the most loyal customers, has lost its market share in the countries of birth, first of all, Aldi and Coles.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's cash and market sales in 2016 will decrease by %4,1 in 2017 and by %2.1 in 2018, resulting in market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3 in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group director Hamish Douglass said that Metcash's "probably likely to move in that year" during a business meal in Melbourne.
Metcash refused to give an answer to Mr. Douglas's questions.
But it's clear that we've been in contact with Mr. Douglass last week with a Metcash.
Since 2010, IGA‚Äôs market share has risen to 14% from 18% from 2010 and has been shown to reduce the volume of trade by around 1200 IGA customers in Metcash, and since 2012, 43% of the profits from the market have fallen, and sales and margins have decreased as the business is under pressure.
But it's becoming a gathering, and it's helping to renovate IGA's stores for hundreds of thousandths of coffee prices each week, helping to make more than 150 million dollars a year for the hundreds of coffee shops in Cole and Woolworths, adding faster new ice creams, and opening up a better special label market series.
Metcash Executive President Ian Morrice says that the purchase and store renewal programs are beginning to produce results and that the gathering has been expected to return to the basic market in 2017 for the first four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis, supported by Deputy Steve Healy, Tennis Australia
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a lot of honor.
Tennis Australia, president of Steve Healy, said that Thanasi Kokkinakis, his friend Nick Kyrgios, was on the side of the last storm, and he deserved a lot of honor.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the expert two, usually referred to as "Special Ks", found himself under the gravitational lights of Stan Wawrinka, in Kyrgyzstan's Montreal Masters.
When Ryan Harrison was separated from the court twice after the trial in Cincinnati, he said, "Wowrinka, Kirgios, I have to go to that kid."
In the last US Open, he was protected by Kokkinakis, who was found faithful by Healy, when he dropped off Richard Gasquet's character so he could lose his character.
A young player now competes with Sam Groth in Glasgow and Davis Cup at the end of the afternoon for the second round against Brittany, behind Bernard Tommy.
Healy spoke in the way "what I've always felt like, I don't think Thanasi's getting into a fight."
He broke his rocket when he fell in front of the U.S., but he wasn't the first player to shoot the rocket because he felt he had a sense of loss, and I know that Thanasi knows he shouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, in the U.S., Harrison and others, he managed very well under the most pro-professional circumstances, and I think he deserves a lot of respect.
There's a great team on the network, a great family, and I think it's gone a little bit too far.
Despite his being 19 years old, he's working at the last level, and he's doing a lot of work, and the team's keeping track of the other players, he's got no problem with the other players, he's got a bad reputation in my bedroom, he's got violent coaches, he's got the last level, and he's got a young man and I think he's got the right to be in his own pockets.
Healy also supported Kyrgyzstan's decision to look forward to important co-operation; from Cuma, he began to explain that he supported Canberran in order to return as a long-term emperor.
Healy said, "We want you to focus your mind on everything, not on the attacks around [Kyrgios],"
And I think Nick, Federer and Murray, as people have pointed out, grew up so fast, and they make some terrible mistakes, and they deserve all the things he's got, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not under the sports lights, he thinks my mind is right, the team and he's the best for himself.
Europe's move crisis: Macaristan has brought about an emergency, closed borders and taken into account the migrants
In order to break the flow of the movement, Macaristan closed the south border with Serbia and took into account those who were trying to enter the country's unfavourable routes.
Hundreds of refugees were forced to assemble in a remote area, and Serbians were forced to move freely.
Travellers who fled from violence in their own countries had to cross the border for an unlimited period of time between the control points of the two countries.
But she was growing up as she walked.
When a police helicopter hit the top of the building, the police called out, "Open the door!" and sent a signal to the police in Macaristan.
Some of them refused to be given water and food as a protest.
As the Serbia-Montenegro, Macedonia, and Greece continue to move, it was explained that it is "unacceptable" to send the migrants back to Macedonia.
(Serbian) It's not going to be a part of the solution.
In the days ahead, Brussels and other countries will have to meet," Ivica Dacic Pragda said.
This aggression, which is bordered with Macedonia-Serbian, came to the scene just one day after the meeting of the 28-State bloc in Brussels.
The farmers agreed to share the responsibility of 40,000 immigrants who were normally opposed to Greece and Italy, and spoke with hope that it would be possible to accept more than 120,000 moves from Macedonia to the EU countries by the end of the month or by the end of the year.
Germany's President Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, called for a week's EU observance to be held in order to face this move crisis.
If Macaristan is, it's not very likely that he will take any action on the matter of Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency call made on Tuesday in the two southern regions provides a broad range of experts with regard to crisis-related issues, the closure of the routes necessary and the speeding up of cases involving refugees.
On the other hand, President Peter Szijarto, the Foreign Minister of Macaristan, said that he planned to take up the heavy duty with Romania in order to stop the flow of immigrants from Serbia.
CBS News, President Charlie D'Agata, had heard that the prisoners in the prisons were also held responsible for their efforts to spy on Serbia, along with Malaysia.
In the last few months, Macedonia has become an important haven and a point of departure for the European Union, and a large part of these migrants have fled from the wars of Syria and other Middle East countries.
President Viktor Orban is surprised to see that a large part of the immigrants who have come to escape from the war are "economic targets" who have come to Europe for a better life, and are fully aware of the experiences of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws that enter into the night in Macaristan bring more severe punishments to human refugees than to bring them to the end of a long, long - distance footing of 4 metres (13 feet) or to harm them.
In a statement made to journalists in the city of Szeged in the south, public speaker Zoltan Kovacs said: "The government of Macaristan is in a state of emergency because of the move."
In one case, we're very clear: it's a crime to go through illegal ways.
Although it still needs to be approved by the mechanic, the Associated Press leaders in the region say they've seen dogs and armed with heavy weapons today.
Orban's senior security spokesman, Gyorgy Bacondi, indicated that he had arrested 15 people who had been arrested by 45 people who tried to break the limits of their powers.
They've been hurt by the existing customs, and now they've been charged with crimes against the police and the new laws.
The competents are speeding up the loudspeakers.
Macar also used a trained train train train to shut down one of the crossings when the seven crossing points between Serbia and Serbia were closed on Tuesday morning.
With a small metal container made up of pressure to perform the work of the macars, Caos was also near the main crossing point near Roszke.
And if 20 people could come in, thousands of people were out.
They told another group that they would not accept their help until they were allowed to enter Makaristan by the car connecting Serbia and Macedonia.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's success in Bernie Sanders' national election has declined half the time
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to lead the two sides of the democratic conflict to the national role, but you, Bernie Sanders, succeeds him.
Clinton now takes 47% of the Democrat games (out of 58) with Sanders 27% (out of 17) in the second place.
President Joe Biden, who has not yet explained that he is at the forefront, takes 15% of democratic games.
He said it was too early to decide which island most of the democratics would choose to support.
But Clinton's supporters have more positive ideas about their own choices than others.
In the past month, CBS News, Clinton has lost its land between a number of demographic groups, and there are some gains from Sanders on the other side.
Clinton has a big difference between women and women, but it's getting worse.
The support between the men fell big there, and Sanders only followed himself from behind five pounds.
Clinton's 50-year-old democratic electorate, and he and Sanders are in the same place now.
But it's quite a big difference between the old clinton election.
Last month, Clinton was moving forward in front of Sander with two sides between liberals, but now Sanders is five pounds ahead of this group.
At the global level, it points out that nearly half of the democratic elections will support Clinton while the party is a party.
When they support one another under some conditions, another 15 percent will support him only if he's called.
One hundred-six-six-pounds don't support Clinton.
Maybe in a way that's never surprising, and in particular in the way of supporting Clinton's existing supporters.
It's even more confusing to see Clinton between those who don't support Clinton right now -- just holding his fruit.
The smaller members of the community are talking about Donald Trump when it says that 48 percent of the democracies will support Clinton with 48 percent of the population (35 percent).
When questions were asked about why Clinton's supporters wanted him to be a candidate, the results were first tested correctly (list 16), and now the idea that a woman's time to choose the president was the best candidate for the job.
Clinton's supporters also voiced his relationship with Bill Clinton. (Laughter 9)
Being sensitive to problems and being selective is among the criteria identified.
As a potential assistant to the president, 57 percent of the democratic voters may want to see that he is in conflict, but the three sides don't think so.
When the democratic elections are asked what's going on in the party's second grade election, it's over by B.
According to more than half of Clinton's supporters, it's Sander that Biden can be the second choice, obviously.
If I don't get into a democratic conflict, Hillary Clindton's success is going to be greater than Sanders, and Biden's 20-pound level is higher than Biden's.
Five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance of winning the general election, but this number has grown to this level since 78 percent last month.
Although I've been looking at it since then, it's been a sad move, but the percentage of those who see it as the most selective habit.
When asked what is the most important thing in a situation again, the democratic electorate is in front of the choice of matters.
Like last month, no democratic election will seem to be accepted as a standard for those first elections.
There are good performances in some of the main characteristics of the democratic groups or the aidads of their own parties.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and reliable, and also to be a person with strong leadership needs.
He's strong about Clinton's leadership when he's the first of three honesty figures.
According to the hundreds of democratic elections, Clinton is not honest and reliable, but half of it has no idea what 27 percent say about Sanders (in the 15th century).
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in their own ideology.
There's no idea about the product of democratic elections in all sizes.
While questions about personal e-mail and the use of the server continue during the Foreign Office, many find it satisfactory to discuss the issue of democratic elections and indicate that their views on it are not affected.
But it's a different story in the general American community.
Only one third of Americans can find a cure now, while half of them are not satisfied with her explanation.
The people's meetings on this matter were split in March shortly after the problem was solved.
Most Americans say they don't affect general discussions about Clinton, and we're on the other side of 36 percent of the way we're on the other side.
They generally say that the communityists, and more than six out of 10 people, say they're breaking up their views on Clinton.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and reliable by his own party's voters, it is still a general problem among the registered voters: when only 32 percent of him is honest and reliable, this number has been eight minutes since May.
The two of the six hundred registered voters find him neither honest nor reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of all registered voters in the country do not find Trump honest and reliable.
He's also taking good note of Clinton and Trump's leadership.
Biden, Carson, and Bush took the best points about honesty between the six cases covered by the test.
More than that, Sanders is always right, but most of them don't have any idea about him as if he's in Carson.
The error rate of %6 points in the statements received from the 351 democratic election.
I'm Carson in national polls right behind Donald Trump.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson Donald Trump is running around
The new report shows that two-and-a-half of the candidates in the election have won the game, and the others have no chance.
Community electors throughout the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with the support of 23% in the latest CBS report, which was made prior to the conflict in Fox News last month, up to 27% on Saturday.
However, Carson's support rose from %6 to %23 at the same time.
Anket also found that Carson went well in demographic groups, and he found his message to be much higher than Trump's support among the university voters.
The others, Carly Fiorina and Ohio Valisi John Kasich, have now fallen to %2 from the 10th-month support of Wisconsin with Scott Walker.
Former Florida Valisi Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Valisi Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio with 6%.
The most recent survey error margin among 376 people selected by the community voters was in %6 and the month of the month of the poll.
Last week, the CNN/ORC survey, which we have published last week, showed the support of Carson's community to 19% of Trump's 32% support immediately.
The last report by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump in front of Carson.
In the past week, when Carson stood up against his height, he apologized for questioning Carson Trump's faith, and he continued to visit the brain at the brain.
"We need energy," said Trump on Friday, in a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherly Member Baruch College blames for the death of a first-class student in Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, he was convicted of murder against five persons.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi was severely attacked by Chun "Michael" Deng at a launch in July 2013 and was sentenced to death by police to take him to the hospital.
The authorities told him that his eyes were bound, that his 30 - pound [30 kg] bag was put in the closet, and that he was kept in line as he was trying to make the move.
Mr. Deng found out that his head was hurt in time and then lost consciousness.
The PI Delta Psi brothers didn't call 911 after they were in love, and they waited an hour before the police took him to the hospital.
But according to police Commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at the press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, called his symptoms in Google, and asked for advice from the national president Andy Meng.
Commissioner Wagner, at this point, members began to keep personal things and stressed the welfare of the brotherhood from Michael Deng.
He didn't wake up and he lost his life next morning.
According to a report by an autopsy, there have been a number of traumas caused by the waves that were reproducing in the head, the neck, the neck, and the neck of an unbroken creature.
In an explanation made by Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, many families lost their lives as a result of the so-called Brotherial Orders, and since 1970, he has lost his life in the least of the educational courses.
Brothers and sisters and members must be held accountable for this, and this is the most important step you can take.
The major jury of Monroe City suggested that the first five members be prosecuted for the third grade of murder.
Mr. Meng, including thirty-two brothers, will also be charged with the acceptance and punishment of the prosecution.
Wagner said at a press conference on Friday, not only those who are involved in the work, but also those who have officially or officially confirmed it, we'll be responsible for them too.
The Baruch College violated the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood ended its relationship with the local community.
What happens when Fed increases his hair?
The high prices of the fairs are high and low and low, and the economy will save recovery.
We know that.
What we don't know is when all of this will happen and how long it will continue.
History, especially in the economy, provides very little information about time.
It's been a short time since the first phase of the increase in the area, and it's been up to 86 months.
The U.S. Central Bank has been an indicator of aggression, although not always consistent, in terms of economic and financial assets.
That's why the U.S. Central Bank insists that investors should focus on how long the normalization process should last, not when it starts to increase, but how much the normalization process should last.
It's a fact that there's different changes.
But as a result, the payees may think that the tax increase has been suspended.
In a note to the clients of the capital economy, Global Economics, Julian Jessop said, "It is inevitable that this financial crisis will mark the end of some of Fed's first phase increase in money."
In addition, we do not expect that U.S. fashion events will slowly become more normal, but it is seen that most of the levels that are still low are fear of extreme work.
We can't say they won't be affected yet.
Based on past trends, some areas of the economy can be given:
Just as it has been seen in the past months, waiting for more physical events to take place can slow down a period of time.
And when the phase is increased, the effect is not so specific.
In a new study on what's going to happen after Fed's increase, the Deutsche Bank analysts said, "Seeing that there's a 12-24-month-long trend after the first phase of the increase in the assets, which may also be a slowdown in money policy."
According to a daily analysis by the Nuveen State Government analysts Bob Doll, Barron's share of the daily analysis, the paya generally recorded cuts in more than 35 documents - 14 rounds - 250 days later, the rate increases in the correct order (between 2.6 and 500 days) and usually returned to the last six times by 14.4 percent.
Deutsche said that the effect on emotions is more specific in the next stages of the phase of growth.
Returning is a fact of economic life, but it will also help them in the long run.
Fed, in modern times, is facing some situations that are not existing and that will speed up recovery.
And you're the most careful of all that's being at the lowest level until today for Fed's hair increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118-percent increase in the area that has occurred since 1950 has only doubled to 4.5 percent since the nominal year.
Despite the fact that the second quarter of 2015 has been achieved at 3.6 levels, Atlanta Fed says that the situation is very low and that the situation is expected to be very low and that the third rate is 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, it can be a risk of increasing your physical activity in an economic environment such as this, and it can lead to the question "will be different this time."
It's been a year since the payrolls expected to increase Fed's salary this week at the Federal Open Piano Committee meeting that will end on Friday.
Although most strategists believe that an economicist FOMC can approve an increase in this meeting, the average market is only 25 percent.
The report stated, "In the research we have done since 1950, all the increases that have taken place to our day are within a super-higher education cycle, and with a gay-suppressive superhero, it is fast reaching the summit after the start of the gathering."
In addition, this was a gathering in a period of unprecedented slowness from the worst time ever to the worst.
The latest version, the longest one you've ever expected since Fed's last return -- the longest one in the list was 35 months, and the one we've been in is still in the 74th month.
It's strong enough to wait for more money in the market, but it's unsatisfied, and it looks like it's like a clean nose.
In fact, when Fed's policy changed, it's more likely that the effect is in the moods than it's in the moods.
When the first growth/birth of the cloud is over, it doesn't change immediately.
At the end of the phase increase, the time comes when they're beginning to suspect," Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab's strategy experts, the increases in the scale will be closer and closer between longer and shorter-term assumptions.
We're looking at high-level thinkers, Kathy Jones, who say that they have a better performance in a environment like this, but they say "we're careful about reaching out."
First of all, Jones is thinking that Fed's political expectations are now at stake.
"In addition to the fall in the energy and inflation expectations, there are various signs that the market has been set up according to the most common monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term rates increase, data flow has increased correctly, credit spreads have increased and distribution has increased - all the features will be seen on the market when the FED policy is accelerated.
In a broad way, companies doing most of the work in the U.S. will gain more and more local products.
The situation of many national companies that are heavily indebted will be worse, the next dollar will make the world market even worse, and the debt will be worse.
In a report prepared by Goldman Sachs for customers, he said, "The history shows that the sense of 'kilteli' can lead to performance failure in the face of such an increase."
In 1994, 1999 and 2004, companies with strong balances exceeded 5 per cent of those who were weak in terms of their growth.
And companies with high-level and low-skilled emotions have passed their low-quality ratios by 4 (in percent) to 3 percent.
The storm is going to be a big issue.
According to Goldman, the company that owes a lot of money at the top is the worst to see.
In addition to the Safi puzzle game, it's expected that the players will benefit from further dollars.
Although experts have different views on how fast they will hold, designers can also be proud of the high winnings.
Andrew Bingham told BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Andrew Bingham, a national spokesman, was impressed by the "extreme" station
He protected himself from the dangers of trading when he went to the radio
He also committed BBC Music Awards and accused him of stealing Britt Awards.
Her friend, Damien Collins, was guilty of breaking free The Voice.
A next official, on the way to BBC Radio 3, told the Classic FM that he was "sustained" by the publisher to put the difference between the other commercial stations.
Nationalist Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the radio channel, which served as an "extraordinary" service, was different from the commercial routes.
"I don't like to use this tape, but Radio 3 "is spreading," he goes back to Classic FM."
And that's also the goal of the BBC Music Awards, which we've set up in the Middle Ages.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year are another version of the British Awards.
Bingham said, "If you're going to do something very different, these are the first two examples that come to my mind, then you're gonna pick up and copy the same thing that's in your pocket."
By rejecting BBC General's impressions, BBC Radio 3's vital live music is clearly ahead of commercial performances in public education.
If I learn from Radio 3, I can't go and learn something about classical music from somewhere else.
And that's the connection to live music, and it's nothing but music.
He also talked about the importance of Radio 3's new music discovery and work.
BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey said that in order to reach more audiences this year, the radio should work more on the history of the past, because he claimed that the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3, Culture, Media and Sport Elections Committee was not the only group that was held to mark BBC's trade records.
Milletvekily Tory Damien Collins de O Ses - the BBC's manufacturing company in the Netherlands sold to compete with the 22 million-star music technology from Talpa Media.
Can't you see why the program has brought so much noise, because it's not fair and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall, Paloma Faith, and Boy George's jealousy over the fact that BBC1 Show has been made a better match to BBC.
She said she wanted to "find a hit out of her blood" before she had another fun program.
However, he did not accept the idea that more of the future was prohibited from the production of the Sound Programme or the use of other forms of the license granted to the holder.
Was Kara Cuma the reason why Internet sales in August were the worst?
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in the number of Internet sales
This is the lowest size ever recorded since 2000 when the last month's records began to be broken.
There were explosions in Internet sales three years ago when mobile devices began to be used for commercial purposes
The researchers explain why Kara Cuma's spending in the summer can be cut off.
Internet trafficking has been on its way for a long time and has turned England's life-threatening trade routes into the city of life.
In the first three months of 2015, researchers indicate that there has been only one percent increase in Internet sales, but then experts indicate that they have given more signs of weakness by going online sales.
In August last year, only five percent of the total was recorded, and this was the lowest in the year 2000 when the records began to be broken.
In the first three months of 2015, experts indicate that there has been only one percent increase in Internet sales, and that there is more corruption in Internet sales than in the first three months of 2015
In his statement to the Guardian, ImRG sales editor Andy Mulcahy said, "If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and especially the 2000s, you will actually see that everything is going back to normal."
He added that, three years ago, consumers began using cell phones to buy products.
This meant that even more people could sell when they were far away.
But now he's going to bed, you can see him.
Kara Cuma, a cross-section taken from America, is shown as one of the reasons why sales slow down.
The authorities indicate that in order to buy something, customers can expect this activity on Friday, Friday, the last day of the month.
In the last year's activity, many companies broke down their company's website in order to obtain more than five times a year in order to obtain cheap products.
The passengers indicate that Kara Cuma's buyers, who showed that merchants fought for the download, may be "sympathetic" for the buyers.
The English Perakenists concluded that every 5-star sales volume of 1-star was spent on the Internet for the sale of the product.
One of three products, like TV and shopping machines, is now bought from Internet stores.
He also buys more than one in four people's clothes and shoes instead of high and visible shopping cards.
The fact that Bin Ladin's family is guilty is that the Muslims succeed in their final journey to the last of their lives in the death penalty in Mekke.
After the first funeral in Mekke, 29 people who lost their lives were taken to the streets by Muslims.
Suudi Binladin held responsibility for the construction of the Suudi Binladin group in charge of the double case in Saudi Arabia.
Health care has shown that 394 people have been injured since the fall of the virus.
An army of 29 people who had lost their lives in the battle against Mescid came to an end to the Muslim army.
The vast majority of the whites, the first funerals have closed the way to the final voyages of the Museum of Faysam in Mekke.
A few days ago, a virgin went through a sacred place where a virgin‚Äôs tomb was located and placed over a hilltop area.
At the same time, in the event of 394 injuries, after having held the Binladin family responsible for the construction of the Kingdom of the South, the death penalty was imposed.
A widow took a life of 29 widows who had lost their lives in the way, and brought them to the wells of the widows.
There were four children in the Bolton region of Manchester, the first time that the deaths took place.
Mr. Akram, he came to Haran with his mother and his father at the beginning of the worship of Haqq.
The Saudi leaders announced that thousands of people who were on their way to Mack√© would continue to attend.
In his statement today, King Salman told Binladin Holding that he should not leave his arm open when I use it.
The Arab version of the farm that the Suudi Press Agency was working by the State indicated that Binladin was the only party to be charged with the case.
The agency's English service did not pass this data, but stated that the company had been taken out of the company's office.
At the beginning of the week, Salman, Vinci, and at the end of the month, swore to them that they would find a cause for the destruction of the hundreds of thousands of Muslims who had come to Hacq.
There was no statement on the wine held by the Binladin group, nor was the representatives allowed to take action.
He blamed the government for not taking the day-to-day security steps and for not cooperating with the meteorologists.
The Mescid, located in Mekke, is surrounded by the ruins of Haran, which are dominated by a large part of these buildings under the leadership of the Binladin group.
Binladin's family has been in close contact with the administration of Saudi Arabia since then and is the name of most of the building projects.
Al-Qaide's last deputy leader, Osama Bin Ladin, was a son of a bitch who had me since I was a child.
In an era of severe drought and floods, every adult Muslim's life was at a loss for at least a few days before millions came to the city of Haqq, where it was just a few days ago.
The authorities reported that 158 people were still in the hospital.
The authorities advised the families of the dead and the rest of the survivors to pay 1 million Royal (174,000 sterlins).
The other wounded will get half of this amount.
B&Q says the boss behind this trend is the Western European sponsors who work for the fly.
Veronique Laurie says the British are taking more jobs
Behind this increase, the number of South European steel producers is growing.
At the end of this, 200 new Screwfix store with destinations is open.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes the 60 B&Q sales point in the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Chief Editor
It's said the British are starting to hire Western European farmers to do their housework instead of leaving behind the shells and shells in their hands.
If you're tired of using a stick or a wall, it means you're going to miss it today.
Because according to the company's boss behind B&Q, the British are working more closely to do DIY at home.
Veronique Laurie, the new general manager of the repair clinic, said that there was a large increase in the number of Western European farmers serving low prices behind this trend.
As a result, the Kingfisher's 60 B&Q sales point is expected to open 200 new Screwfix store more.
Ms. Laurie B&Q wanted more women to be employed because she said she was given eight women because of the ten sale decisions in the store.
Most of the staff are now men.
She said that it was necessary to manage to meet the growing demographic trends seen in the house by a woman who made more house repair than she did in the past.
Ms. Laurie said, "There's still a lot of men working in our stores.
We need to get more water.
In principle, half of our clients are made by women and 80 percent of the decisions made regarding products purchased for sale are made by women.
Women play a major role in making decisions.
Ms. Lauriy, one of the five women in the head of FTSE100, also one of Britain's leading companies, reconfigured the top team in the same way as the male and female managers.
The Kingfisher, the general manager and the financial manager, the 50 percent of the team's team is almost the same in this area.
Ms. Laurie said, "This is a well-known decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to get to the administration.
After the group was loaded with the estate of the warehouses, the Kingfisher heard that there was a drop in sales in both at the bottom of the month and under.
In the end of the trend, Kingfisher will open 200 new store owned by Screwfix and B&Q
Time to decide more for the ABD Central Bank for the FED
The United States Central Bank monitors the two daily meetings that continue on Wednesday and Friday; the decision is expected to be made ten years later by not increasing the number of TV events.
In a report by Reuters, they say that the FED will apply this decision a little bit more than 80 economists a week ago, and now they think it's going to be between 0 and 0.25.
It's a historic event that happened seven years ago since the FED sent down the waves.
Peterson, a leading researcher from the International Economic Institute for Economic Affairs, said, "We'll be the first time that a large central bank comes out of a zero point and starts normalising the fashions."
The U.S. economy contributes to the balance of billions of dollars in the process of reorganizing and reorganizing the economy and creating less inflation.
But the FED can't look at the global table, which is less promising.
He warned the merchants against an increase, but they also believed that the situation would not allow for such a rise.
The decision will be announced on Friday at 20 a.m.
He left a letter of apology for his murder at Delta State University
According to experts on Tuesday, Shannon Lamb left a note saying that he was "right" for the first murder and "if I could get back" after killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Friday morning and in the coming hours of the same day.
The Mississippi Gautier police, at Delta State University, called for 911 in the 10 a.m. of Lamb, who is a professor of education and social sciences.
She said she said she killed her trader and someone by gunfire.
Lamb said he should send the police to the duty on the phone.
Lamb, who said, "I killed my wife last night," also indicated that there was a "beautiful dog that didn't hurt anybody," and he was probably sad.
Even if the police asked for his name, he didn't mention it.
He didn't even make a statement about the Lamb's murder.
When the police took place, Amy Prentiss, 41, met with a note written by Lamb, 45, "I'm sorry, I wish I could take the time back.
I loved Amy very much, and she was the only person I've ever loved.
Lamb, after writing this note, went to Delta Island 300 miles away and killed historian Professor Ethan Schmidt, and then the police chased him away.
Professor William LaForge of the University said that he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said, "There are some things in Lamb's mind."
Despite reports that Lamb, his girlfriend Prentiss, even though he believed in a sensitive relationship with Schmidt on Tuesday, indicated that he did not have "no knowledge or proof" in his hand that he was a "love triangle".
Seven-year-old still married to Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, is known as Prentiss as a "good guy."
Two were divorced 15 years ago, but they were friends.
O'Stepen said that a 19-year-old girl was found with Prentiss and that she was "in a broken state."
O'Stepen also stated that his daughter and Prentiss were "the best friend of each other."
Sun Herald was working online from Prentiss' home, which was identified as a close friend of parentings.
Knowles said a horseman named Lightning had been with Prentiss for about three years with Lamb.
Knowles said, "He always loved helping others."
He said, "I'm not going in yet," calling for the police Lamb's birthday.
At 1 Highway near Greenville the same night, the police took him close to the Lamb's side, shot him, rushed to the forest area, attacked him and attacked him.
According to the CV published on the University's website, Lamb was awarded a scholarship to a doctor at Delta State University in early 2015.
The stars that lost their ancient civilization
The actor who was seen with his son, Redmond, had been in a very stressful state for several years.
In 2001, he fought cancer, and in 2009 he sacrificed his friend Farrah Fawcett for cancer.
The actor, who said he was fighting drugs, was arrested in 2008.
All of this, of course, hurt him very much.
Luke Shaw's double cut out of Manchester United in the months out.
Luke Shaw's right arm suffered two cuts in the fight against PSV Endhoven at the University of Manchester Championships in the League.
This incident, which led to the sight of the defense player, left him for at least six months away from the streets, is the hope that Louis van Gaal Shaw will be able to return to the hall again this season.
Unfortunately, during the 15th of March, when Shaw's 20-year-old game was hit by a bomb, H√©ctor Moreno became the reason for his unattended presence.
He was treated for nine minutes and then he had to be given oxygen before he was in the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "Drive out of two at the top and now in the hospital."
Today or later, maybe he'll be in love with you and he'll be taken to the hospital in Manchester.
A bad situation - a young man who moved to Manchester at the age of 18, you're going through difficult times, then you're going to play a great game and then you're gonna come over.
He had an oxygen mask in his face when he was in my bedroom.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you're two, it means at least six months and it means you can't play in the community.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno had the chance to save part of the bone from the red card and from the pen.
Justice Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexico.
Van Gaal was suggesting that the Italians had made a mistake.
When I say it's a pen and red card, you can blame yourself.
It was a very bad fight with two eyes.
The tweet from Shaw's account said, "I thank you all for your messages. I don't have enough words to tell you what I'm going through, I'm getting better now, and I'm going to be stronger."
Next: Luke Shaw, who lives at the University of Manchester United PSV
The champions who will be organized in the front of our team will be morally responsible for improving the Ligi English defence player.
PSV Technical Director Phillip Cocu said, "It's a very bad move."
If it's such a mess, it's gonna happen to any player, everyone's sorry about it.
The purpose of our players is not always to clean up their reputation.
Moreno, 2014 in the World Cup, also lived in a football club against Van Gaal in the Netherlands.
Cocu, this is very difficult because his intention was never to clean up his girlfriend, and it wasn't good after he heard that it was a very bad break.
I couldn't see that in my mouth.
The only thing I could see was that he was headed differently, like Moreno touched him, but I didn't see Luke's theft.
Moreno says, "I know how you feel, I know how hard something can be.
I feel so bad for this, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado was transferred from the PSV to the final hospital for the fight with Chris Smalling.
Of course David Cameron The Lorax knows better than that?
That's one thing that every parent has learned in a short time: when your child loves a book, you know that you're not going to have more time to learn it.
Looks like if you weren't David Cameron.
When asked what was the most popular child book by a workshop programmer for child care, President The Lorax chose a 1971 environmental issue by Dr. Seuss.
Cameron, who wrote in a message published on the SuperCamps website, continues: "I like to read this book, which is a funny, exciting, creative, and powerful message, because it always contains a message that we always have."
Everything went so well up here that Cameron wrote something about the contents of the powerful book, but actually the new character and details of the book that was added to the 2012 film version to make it unique.
A child named Ted in Thneed-Ville, where the whole nature is missing, with the walls where the air is a target, is trying to fulfill his dream of seeing Audrey's true tree to win her heart, says the real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, and a love story that Dr. Seuss did not know in 1991.
If you're not sure if it's a little bit more like that in the Internet Film Archive The Lora's short-lived text, which says, "It's about to win Audrey's heart in the city of Thneed-Ville, a child's vision."
In view of all the allegations of the existence of the work, it seems unlikely that Cameron, a young man named Lorax, who is also known as Lorax, is aware of the fact that despite the limitations of the complex and "spoiled tree names" created by the trees, he was eager to cut down the trees, to learn how it was destroyed by the forgiving Ones.
It's likely that this weak, weak nation has been inspired by a law firm, who has not read The Lorax to a child more than 20 times.
One of the president's speakers said the text was thought to be from Cameron's election office.
The SuperCamps text indicates that Cameron's staff were provided, but there was no other way.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk for England's release, but I still don't know.
It's a hard task to play with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but after seeing the English team selected for the tour, I don't think there's one more of the 3-0 test units in the past.
I still don't give up the possibility of a deposition.
Alastair Cook's team may be more untestable than three years ago, but there are players who return well on the battle line and the collective understanding of the game is strong; they do not improve 2012's wounds, but they only provide a few youth-based well-being.
In the collective game, Moeen Ali is becoming a player, and Judge Rashid, even though he does not know the quality of the test level, represents an attack option.
Next: Adam Lyth from England's Test Team and Alex Hales was brought to his place
Adam Lyth's decision to take out, it's hard for me to analyze as a major coach in Yorkshire.
There were two good fathers in the seven severe trials, and it was simple but inevitable that the real cricketers were eventually treated as a result.
For example, there was no question about Joe Root, and he was still in the mood because, as I said before, the players were the best choices.
After a couple of weeks, he could see Lyth's career extended, but he recognized his own fate.
I hope he'll get another chance if he works more for Yorkshire.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss, although he didn't show the best performance, didn't surprise me; he was a team man first.
It's hard to figure out how long a test shooter's taking note of it.
Lyth, like Sam Robson before him, received nine more from Nick Compton.
Only Compton got the chance of a giant game.
The only chance you can feel is that Jonathan Trott would first go to Karaipele - while Lyth's shape is in motion - but this empty opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Halles is coming and I think he's a high-level shooter.
A cricket in the X-factor's target, and this, at the beginning of this season, when Trent Bridge made 236 against us, we saw it in Yorkshire.
At least he should be able to take the same opportunity before him, but of course it's about the United Arab Emirates team.
Moeen made an open fight with Cook so that he could make more than four quickseats, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a shooter couldn't shoot here, but above all, this left-handed sticker already showed how good it is as a cricket.
Moen, he couldn't do his job for Worcestershire, but he saw three numbers for them, and there's no difference too much.
My former team friend Justin Langer played his first 38 exams before he started out in 2001.
He caught the three hundred series right away and didn't look behind him.
The Zafar Ansari team is coming back to play seven games, and I was surprised to see him as a young man active in my limited conversation with me.
People can see all the statistics -- 31 averages and 35 averages in the war -- and they can think that it's a ring, but there's not a lot of players who take off their hands, and the players' choices are even younger than they are.
He'll learn a lot about this crowd.
From Egypt, England seems to have made a number of hardware supplements to its own trainer team.
Sri Lanka's attacker Mahela Jaywardene may be a step forward to be assigned as a spokesman for the test games.
He's one of the most popular people in the game. He's going to bring every move and every attempt against all forces.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white ball foot, and the energy and the game are winning an unforgettable series.
I've always thought he was born for the world of cricket, and there's an understanding that he can be treated like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the chat room, even when the previous messages are sent, may bring a news to the team.
Colly's team friend, Ben Stokes, is listening to a day-to-day game, gives Root a model like Australia, and I don't have a question about it.
Not everyone is made by the plan, the coaches, and the players who choose not to think the same thing.
And you should not forget that their work depends on the results, like players.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The Brexit camp can win while the economy is stable until 2017
David Cameron's strategy to hold Britain in the United States is getting worse every day, and this situation's Jeremy "Yes?" despite being elected by Corbyn's Labour Party's leadership or being expelled from the TEC's workday on Europe.
And the foreigners have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
In recent years, my European diplomat, a friend of the European Union, has shown that some Member States, in the U.S. that they do not want to do so much, have made changes in the way Britain thinks it is.
TUC decided he didn't want them to harm social protection during the annual meeting in Brighton.
We can even call this Dave and George my own day.
The President and Chancellor, the presidents of foreign countries, are taking their own pictures and saying that they have gathered for reform without any special signs.
It's entirely up to me.
When Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France," my friend in the United States, who wanted to return to Britain, said that my friend, who wanted to go abroad, had come to a point where some foreigners would not want us to stay.
The chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, wants to leave without having to go to a bad situation like that of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16 years old).
Fran√ßois Holland, in 2017, is facing a change in election or change.
It's a force that's asking.
Soon there will be a millionaire government from my right in Poland, and in Spain, a government from my left.
In order to prevent the United Kingdom from leaving the United Kingdom, Selfie Brittany is not likely to show a miracle to the British in this country, and they do not want it, because most of them have different schools.
I mean, some of them may be planning to speed up the Brexit season during the 2017 United Kingdom campaign.
"There wasn't anything to do with the last conversation," and "Britisha didn't get anything to benefit from the discussion again."
Europeans were not the same in Tony Benn's time, knowing how exciting the Fleet Street was from the past, how exciting it was to know how impressive it is to have been for the US press barons, and they were inspired by a reference to 1975, which confirmed our entry in 1973 on a 1st occasion.
In the early 1990s, the British president named Boris Johnson, who heard the name "EU right cheeks", is remembered as such.
He knew who the enemies of Ed Miliband were.
Among them were tax collectors, foreigners who listened to the phone outside, and the vast majority of our newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was thinking the same things over and over again, but he realized that if he was in the middle of an angry gorilla, he would have to share his attention with him in his lunchtime and after dinner so that he wouldn't have to eat.
In fact, Miliband, a prominent reference by Cameron, was Blair from Blair and Blair, who was taught the principle on the EU motherhood of the French and Dutch players who gave him the birth certificate in 2005.
He never forgave her for that.
But on Wednesday, in Westminster, when I told myself that there was no time for me to lose -- Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, and then Murdoch, who is now in his 80s, seems to be in danger of being reassessed.
Although it's gonna take time, it's not me, it's like we need to develop a sustainable strategy to keep in touch with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC's birthday.
I'm saying Corbyn's official business in Europe is in progress.
He says he wants us to stay in an EU that's been reformed.
Most of the people who remain outside of Ukip's hostility say yes to that, and the fire supporters of the Migrating Little English.
In fact, Hilary Benn said, "It's Benn, but not Bennite," and on the radio and television this week, he forced himself to accept that Corbyn's father was a bad idea as a celebrity chance.
This reminded me of his workmates in his office on television in the '70s, his workmates, his lack of progress, and the loss of his office.
Hillary's fight was more exciting.
But the "Benn's expression" was the same as saying to the gods at a special meeting to the peoples.
In view of what happened to me, Corbyn's attempt to communicate with me continues to protect his message's attention by 7/24 TV and by means of a well-known social media environment with paranoia and deception.
As McDonnell said, when I refer to Cameron, it's a great challenge to put pressure on Europe in order to secure the support of the Labour Party.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
However, the transition between the Bennite savings economy and the anti-capitalist history of the EU membership of McDonnell and Corbyn is no longer a personal dispute between the left-hand side managers of the educational heritage of the small race.
As is the case with Nato's transition, Tom Watson will have to force foreign diplomats to take out one of these for the heads of the countries.
And why did Paris or Berlin lose their political influence on Britain's chances of losing it?
As I was told at the opening of the British Security Forum on Friday, the U.S. government, despite the fact that the UK, despite the lack of military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, was in a state of despair.
Patients are doing an e-mail investigation into the health of the English People's Republic of England
Researchers have indicated at a meeting of 12 individuals associated with the whole industry, that a government-funded agency is less than 95 per cent more harmful than smoking.
Scientists who wrote in the British Model (BMJ) were involved in adding evidence to the report of the English People's Health (PHE) e-signature.
PHE published a report last month on the term "dotting in a separate format" that was identified as "delelor's internship in a separate format.
But some researchers questioned the health of the data and took note of the connections between scientists and the entire industry.
Lancet's former prime minister of the county, PHE's mother-in-law, took the aim of "sex-in-law" to follow the end of PHE.
Two other researchers in the BMJ were asked whether the ideas were "the cave or whether the stone was built on it."
Professor Martin McKee and professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University in London Hygyen and Tropical School said: "The impact of basic health policies on people's health is a great deal of confusion."
The people said that "the best estimate is that almost 95% is more harmful than e-signatured smoking" is expected to stop evidence and modelling in a different context.
In fact, it consists of a 12-person meeting to develop a multi-critical decision-making analysis (MCDA) to create a synthesis of the findings on the various products involved in this nicotine; the results of the meeting are set out in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company known as EuroSwiss Health, which had previously received the funds from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
They also told him that he had confirmed BAT's health certificate in a possible report.
They added that one of the 12 persons at the meeting said they had received a phone from an e-mail producer but that it had not been received earlier by Philip Morris International from the smoking company.
There was no information on how the panel members were selected, but some of these include some of the known states of the e-sigrant that described the prehistoric background of some of the articles.
Some others who are ready for the meeting are not aware of all the controls.
The meeting was attended by all the responsible persons at PHE.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research article "in an "excellent way" "in a way that most of the victims agree" to be sumptuous evidence of the damages.
But none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that there was no evidence of a switch to smoking for children or non-smokers."
The Health and Health Director at PHE said Professor Kevin Fenton, BMJ, had been given an answer before.
He said, "The e-mails are less harmful than the use of cigarettes."
One of two people with a life history of smoking is dying from this addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks caused by e-signatures are minimal, but we need to continue to focus on their long-term effects.
PHE has a clean role: to be informed about a time when there is a lot of confusion about the damage when it is fully understood and it shows evidence and does not show it.
Nearly 80,000 people die of a drug-related disease each year, and smoking is costing NHS $2 billion a year.
The existing evidence is that e-sygara is not safe, but because it is only a small part of the damage caused by smoking, we are openly putting our national responsibility in place.
First Channel 4 told the chief of BBC to leave EastEnders.
First Channel 4 president Luke Johnson BBC said that Eastenders and The Voice should stop publishing programs like the East Enders and the Voice, and indicated that the advertisers could "give their right hands for hot programs, such as Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should be used only for programs that are not made by other English publishers.
BBC has made it possible for BBC to place its service programmes, which are likely to be monitored by a smaller monitoring group, against the most estimating programmes of its opponents in the valuable environments, such as BBC4.
After saying that BBC Director General Tony Hall wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said it was a failure in his own time on Channel 4 to establish a link with BBC for six years.
Johnson said to the Lords Chamber Communication Committee on BBC during a question about the future of the BBC, "I struggle with the idea of preparing and publishing programs that can be clearly presented by BBC without any objection."
If you insist on applying the license, which I'm not sure is a good idea in the middle or long run, you have to download at least one of the programs that others didn't do or did not smoke.
The Voice is published in the middle of the premium because they want to provide a wide range of support as long as it can be in the future.
The idea here is based on the idea that someone else can't publish it, that it's funny and clearly crazy.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why programs that can be financed without assistance should be used with a limited amount of tax.
The Voice is one of them, and EastEnders is in the other and actually in the company.
If it's to be honest, other channels will give it their right hands for that.
I'm trying to see how it's published.
I don't think it's going to destroy BBC.
Johnson, a series of participants leading the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of running the lead "from the crowd working here and from seeing this approach as the best way to ensure long-term support" by the BBC.
The BBC's most popular programme trends are re-examined by Sky Director Tony Ball, who used MacTaggart in 2003 to offer BBC programs such as East Enders.
Johnson BBC said that the most appropriate service programmes are going to BBC4 and that the monitor size is not going to be made here, but that they are facing the tax burden and will be able to carry on their religious duties for the next four billion steroids of Earth's Earth health. And he added, "We're doing all these medical programs that no one can watch."
They put these in blanks that no one will ever see.
With regard to the license, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a more aggressive system than that of those who have the best interests of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think, 150 stars a big value a year, but I'm wondering why they don't watch too many BBCs for people with a lot of money.
At the same time, Sky and Channel 5, director David Elstein, who gave evidence to the Saturday Committee, said that the BBC should review Reithian's mission to "information, training and entertainment".
BBC's release is now classified as an image education - it's about %1 and the radio %0.1 -- and it's about to be a priority in Australia and Canada, and it needs to be changed as "information, explanation and training".
In the case of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC only had to do something about the Proms shown on TV and that he had to join the advertising vendors in order to ensure that everyone was monitored by the translator.
Sonogenetics enables the brain to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how they've changed the way they've been hit by the sound waves.
Scientists have developed genetically modified brain systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
They change the direction they've been hit with the noise waves that people can't hear.
The titrations are operating genetically modified motor neuron cells around the environment to transport the harmful channels that lead to the sound waves.
Next: Researchers lightly read and write brain activity
Researchers have said that insects have demonstrated the power of a new process called Sonogenetic; so ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brains, heart and bone cells outside the body.
In California, researcher Sreekant Chalasani Guardian from the Salk Institute in La Jolla said that this process could take place in a process that allows people to develop the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in their brains, which give them electrical titrations in their brains.
They don't usually repeat the words, but they found that when they were surrounded by a cell containing chalassian microscopic fibers, they turned it over.
The bells found strengthen the ears of the deaf and thus enable them to pass through the ears of the deaf.
The reinforced third-party waves, some of which are found in the brain cells, and the TRP-4 ion channels, are influenced by structures called ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, the sound waves enable this ion channels to be opened and activated by the ion channels they are connected.
In order to create voice-controlled voice circuits, Chalasian genetically changed the curves so that some motor neurons can carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applied to modified creatures, the sound waves were powered by micro-squares and flowed into the circuits, and here they were operating modified motor neurons.
This is the process, where scientists find similarities to the optogenetics of an open tool that enables the neurons to operate and shut down the nerves of the scientists.
But Chalasani says it could be some advantage against this technique.
In addition to the light to be sent to the desired point in the brain, low frequency audio waves can pass through the brain without delay and can thus be transmitted through the brain through the head.
Chalasani said, "We believe that the human neurons intended for specific neurological treatments can be transmitted temporarily by a signal through the use of genotherapy and treatment virus."
He also added that other applications may be compatible with bone cells and insulin cells.
Or your non-violence team-- you're wearing the full door!
Advertising undermines England's arms trade
Watch the gun-fighting video of the U.S. Army.
Terrible killer drones!
The pandas that break your foot!
A piece of heavy bombs!
And why the intense pain, but the power schools don't let go!
The Indian sound and graphic film that was produced for the U.S. Air Force, which was produced by the Government of England at the ExCel Center in the London Railway, is no doubt about the fact that the world's largest arms force is a short-lived traitor.
Front row: DSEI gunfire: The authorities are attacking London
But a different campaign continues with bus stops and posters on the subway trains and needs to look twice.
In fact, using the London Metros font and trademark, he turns his DLR line into a tank, saying, "Are you going to travel to DLR between 15 and 18 months of age?"
This is Elul, who wants to help his clients stop this gun from coming to DLR.
300 posters, one of the most famous artists at the Bansky Museum of Criminal Designs in Dismalland.
A collection called the Group of the Special Affairs helped to be distributed using the "Darbe Packages in the Advertisement Area" which declared "the area of the country's bus station has gained access to nearly three areas".
I wasn't happy with this "vandalism" for London.
One of the ads was created by a group collection to the Special Bureau.
According to the director of the Crimean Designs and the Essex University of Education, manufacturers are becoming more and more suspicious every day and are looking for ways to move people outside the camps.
They're moving with activists in a lot of protest movements, and they're starting to realize that they need to go out to the real world so that their events can have an impact on the community.
Another gun's been hit by the posters and those who travel in the subway.
In 24 hours, the video of the International Af Eurg√ºtto video was watched by more than 100,000 people on Facebook and was created by a VCCP advertising agency that worked free of charge and was also prepared by the graphic designer.
VCCP creator manager Matt Lever was so surprised by the silence against the propaganda of the armed forces -- with the empty exCel sequence -- and he thought, "Let's see a campaign they've been trying to escape."
More real, creatively, they've been playing with the idea of advertising, but they've become more careful with bright colors and animation.
Tom Davies from Af √ñrg√ºtt√∫ said: "We have been very helpful in creating logs for the sale of non-lawless torture teams in Fvarda."
Now we need the Government of England to prevent the illegal sale of force equipment in front of our door.
Maybe it comes from ExCeL, the most creative station in the field of arms, and it's where the designers are selling great-grandparent products.
In a press release, Saab showed the U.S. Army's "AT4CS RS" crew.
It contains "the chapter of the war that hits a great deal of uneven form and target."

Eight golden rule of living in student places
I've spent 11 years moving to where I'm a young person, and I still believe in sex and sex, but now I remember some long-term complaints about what I'm having to do with my frustrations -- and about others.
Most of what I've learned can be covered by eight golden rules.
Moving on to the ground can take a look at the total amount of damage from the brain disorder.
The origin of the celebration: where it is for people, where it's not for the year, where it's for Corbyn, and why you're saying, "You don't like Marmite, you don't hate him, because the gentlemen really are just the one who's gonna be in the room."
Take a breath.
And let the others take one -- ask questions and take a look at it.
It will lead to this conversation and help you to separate what you like from the people you do not talk to.
Leave the people a little bit.
People's rooms often turn into a drink reception, a dinner table and a social gathering, but these are the same places where people dress and set their drinks.
Next: Don't even think about starting a relationship with the university
Homecomings see the bad guys at the university.
Your room may be a place of comfort, but many local corridor rooms develop a culture of isolation, and this friend's life, life, life, life, life, life.
It could be hell for someone who works for this energy storage.
I don't let anything in culture say, "I like you and I want our friendship to go on, but I need you to go a little bit, so I can get the energy I spend with you when I get in touch with you."
Try to tell a friend that you're tired of socializing and maybe throw a message instead of playing the door.
When he said to steal the door, do it.
A friend in the student country had made a policy like he was invited inside if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a lot.
Don't make friends on the way to the funeral.
Since you've begun to go to university in the wake of the food conflict, it's less strange and less like the 1950s to get to know yourself by playing with a cup of brownie. "You're welcome, I've been drinking something for you, and now I'm going to laugh when you ask personal questions."
It's a great way to make friends with people at home.
It's hard to talk to your friends at home, and maybe they'll contact your face with a lovely surprise.
Obviously, it's about being a mouthpiece for you.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, it's, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well,
It's a crime that's very common in the places where food is to be played.
I mean, it's an act of stealing someone's shoes, but it's a robbery, but it's a couple of drinks for your tea?
Check the owner twice.
He'll tell you to look at his head, even if he's in a big hurry.
It's very frustrating to steal from someone's stuff, and I understand you, but try to do it in a way far more than my friend of mine.
Now she's shut up.
Don't make fun of people so they'll get out of bed or school.
This doesn't just mean being a right person, but because you're the people in the cam houses.
A girl in my corridor knocked on her neighbor's side of the street and said she had a few pieces of paper because she said it was the 3rd night and she was testing herself in the morning.
The response was even more open.
When they closed at 5:00 at the end of the morning, the girl opened her own music and locked the door, and she gave them her own three-hour test for two hours.
Isn't it romantic that your future wife moved to the same corridor with you?
On the other hand, would it not be very strange to think of a Korean friend as a future wife if he misjudged, arrested, separated, and saw him every day and watched your partner be arrested?
Of course, that's fine, but if it's not your neighbor's future wife, at least talk to him in the right direction.
When you realize that someone has left the keys to lock the door, you know it's less than the line between the joke and the bullying.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to get back.
You can give a valuable and fun lesson about keeping someone's things safe, but never touch someone's room with a sweat and a toothbrush.
Lock your doors and put your keys into a glass of water, but don't put your stuff in double-click.

I hope you're surprised at Bulut!
The last offer came from Eski≈°ehirsport to hope Bulut, who did not argue with G.Saray's side of the year, and in the final games, because of the prosthetics of the tribes.
He lost his position. He wanted to get out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer period, he also made my last name on Eski≈°ehirsport for the millions who wanted to join Kashimbasah.
However, the Red Blacks were answered by G.Saray's administration.
The heart stopped while I was trying to heal
RIO DA JANEIRO's mother, Raquel Santos (28), introduced an aesthetic doctor to remove the tears from her eyes on the day of the last trade.
She was forced to take the heart shots and breathing after a while of the woman who was infected with her lung disease.
Then his heart stopped losing his last life.
The police are investigating whether the "Potenay" drug used as a day-to-day is not involved in the death of a woman.
The real cause of death will be determined after the bus.
One of his closest friends, Deborah Azivedo, said in a statement to Brazil, said that Santos, who had two sons at seven and a half years of age, had been involved in aesthetic surgery.
The second of Brazil's most important beauty contests was that of Moses to Brazil in the middle of the month.
Petrol companies have collapsed in images
From 2014 when Petrol's prices began to fall, the most deep sea-water oil-speech projects were launched, bringing about $400 billion to the end of the last year.
According to the competition company Wood Mackenzie's research, while low oil prices, oil and gas/gas are being spent on projects of $380 billion in demand, it has also been sold to Africa in a wide range of countries.
As a major reason of the financial cut-offs, in 2014 it took place at a $115 level, which showed oil prices falling to the lowest 12-year-old level in 1.5 years, and lost 70-year-olds in a dramatic way.
$400 billion (U.S.)
Well, the oil prices were new surprises every day, and we finally saw the lowest rate we've had for 12 years.
The research published by Wood Mackenzie in the field of energy communication shows how the sector is affected by the decline in prices today, which is now under way.
In a recent report published in Timmuz, the oil prices dropped by $200 billion, which is the reason why 46 major energy investments were taken into account, led by Wood Mackenzie, revealed where this figure was reached by 2015 in his new research.
Therefore, during the last six months of 2015, 22 major projects were under way, and 68 major projects have been completed in the group since 2014.
The value of these projects is about $400 billion.
ANNEX 2.9 MILLION
In a study of the impact of small oil prices on companies' plans, it is reported that the most influential projects are deep sea development projects.
The projects that have been completed are estimated to have generated a total of 27 billion barrels of oil as well as a total of 2.9 million barrels daily by 2025.
According to the study, when the majority of projects were reached in 2017 and thereafter, the first production targets were recorded between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 projects in the morning, the estimated $170 billion potential investment in the past five years has been taken place, "the vast majority of $170 billion is deep ocean projects."
And that's why it's a very high level of capitalism.
It is said that 70 percent of the deep sea costs create heavy oil projects in Nigeria, Angola and the United States of America."
According to the survey, countries with the most expensive oil project are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of the oil reserves in the morning.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, together with 85 percent of the world's largest gas reserves, make up the largest gas reserves in the world.
While most of your generation is expected to come out here at the bottom of the sea, there must be complex and complex solutions such as the formation of a complex and complex development such as the formation of a complex and complex nature (LNG) from the sea.
It is also indicated that companies that are at risk of being exposed to the "lower" oil prices of the companies in Canada, the deep sea, and the gas pipelines that monitor each other in the Gaza Strip, are also trying to adapt to the "lower" oil files scenario.
G√∂zler, Iran
Not long ago, just four years ago, there was a table like this: U.S. and Europe, brought the oil to Iran to stop the nuclear programme of Tahran, the oil price was about $110, and Iran's oil consumption was trying to figure out how to cut down on the prices without any reason.
And when we get back this week, we're seeing a banana scenario.
Since 2004, Petrol's prices have been down at $30 for the first time, and it's mainly because of the production in the U.S. and the barriers to Iran are rising.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
As Iran's oil supply increases, it's going to be even more oiled on the oil market, which has already been declared to be so full.
And that's why the prizes have brought us down to today's amazing levels of love.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, who doesn't want to sell the market to Iran, will pump more oil and will be able to win a price fight between Iran-S.Arabistan.
The constructions are unstoppable, and Iran's main target is the rapidly expanding oil market in Asya, India and Europe.
The Iranian authorities said they wanted to increase the first rate of growth of 500 thousand dollars a day and then spend as much more on the market as they had done before.
According to Reuters's map information, 22 large-scale oil carriers (VLCC) in Iran are expected to have at least 13" full or large amounts of these.
Iran has the largest oil reserves in the world.
As far as I'm concerned, Iran is still carrying out nearly 1 million nuclear acts in some countries where Turkey is located.
Before I did it, Iran's daily oil consumption was up to three million varieties a day.
According to the support of the Human Resources Research Centre, oil is worth 20 dollars below the demand for oil: "Central global growth concerns are increasing the pressure of the lower oil prices, causing loss of oil prices to rise."
In China, the world's largest oil producer, we see that this has reached 20 percent of the oil losses since the year the oil demand declines in parallel to economic slowdown in China.
We can also testify to the global value of dollars as well as the impact of global debt problems on oil in our future.
As long as we don't see the remaining bids on 32-33 levels, the oil can be limited by the rising movement and can increase the pressure below.
At this point, it can be said that there's a key role to play in keeping the gap under a 30-dollar level visible.
In such a situation, it should not be surprising that there are cuts from 23.30-25.60 below.
Isham Sardouk says, "The angel has finished!"
While Victoria's Secret and the world's fashion minds are being shaped by the trend creation, why have you turned the route to Turkey?
- I always look at the change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, and I went to New York.
I've raised important positions there too.
In the meantime, I've been talking to Koton for the last two years.
And then I saw the potential in this graph and in the Koton market.
I realized that everything was necessary to make a store in the vicinity of the world.
Now I'm here to make this happen.
Will you be able to win in a short time?
- Sure.
Although he's already a young brand, he's now sold in 50 countries.
We're doing 50 collections a year, and there's 15 separate sections.
So there's everything you need to have in a store.
From Dubai, we can meet the needs of our customers in various caves in Moscow.
Now, in March, we're opening a store in Paris, and it's the beginning of a new and exciting revolution...
Is it necessary to open the store in Paris?
- Yeah.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is a mess.
But you'll open some stores for pictures.
Paris, you'll have a store in fashion, like London, and you'll get the money from the Middle East.
One needs a brand, the other money, and both needs a brand that plays a prominent role.
Well, let's talk about trends...
- There's a very romantic, dark season in front of us.
If they're wearing a flying phone, they're soft tones, beads, whites, reds.
Draw...
We're going through very difficult and painful times, and in these difficult times, the fashion world is always trying to maintain a sense of happiness in life by moving the light and the interior design into the path of life.
That's what we did.
That's why the call comes back in the new season.
Let's go back to Victoria's Secret for years.
Who's the worst angel ever?
I'm just not talking about great physics: so positive, so good girl!
When I was working, he sat next to me and said, "My heart, you're open."
He was so cute.
You know why I'm talking about it, and I've studied it, and you've reported all Victoria's Secret Models.
Isn't Caroline so beautiful?
But Adriana Lima had a great influence on me with her beauty.
- Yeah, the sound!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you're going to say, "Sit down and be nice, and don't do anything else."
He's bringing the pig.
That's right, those shoes live.
I've been reporting to Candice Swanapoel.
She was the best girl I've ever seen in my life, but I fell in love with her innocence.
- That's it.
It's not like the new angels' tools...
I remember Gisele's turn...
It was hard to work with him.
She came to the hospital, smoked smoke like a cigarette.
It's not about being Tyrian.
No one's drinking or one's drinking!
The purpose is to make a diva.
Victoria's Secret Deficiency, published two months ago, took the lowest rating in history.
Why are you?
- Like I said, it's over with that beautiful angel.
Who's gonna do Gigi Hadid?
What's nice?
Kendall Jenner, like...
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Kate Moss's name was the biggest name of the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful his face was.
I want to use my right here.
I've been reporting last year. It's been a pretty good thing.
- That's how smoking, drinking, now, of course.
But there was such a beautiful face in the docks.
It was like Brigitte Bardot.
That supermodel grew to the end of the cycle.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was next to me, and every morning I saw nothing.
Such a constant beauty can't be such an experience.
What about Cara Delevigne?
- She's hurting herself.
Not even in every campaign.
People are coming.
There's no openness to 'mature models, celebrity' like the tools already.
People like themselves, they want to see the real faces in the campaigns.
We'll go over it, too.
Because that's the trend.
Letter from 25 author to Turkey
According to BBC Turkey, the United Kingdom of Great Britain (PEN) and the presidents of Galleries and Ischoscia have shown that there is an emerging part of the threat posed by colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey.
Two attacks aimed at Turkey's Hurriet newspaper were considered by the Koza Group to be under the supervision of Vice News officials, and the prosecutions and arrests of journalists were among the major developments.
My mother had an argument about the right to work.
Turkey-Work, "We think that mothers have been given half the right to work so that sickness work can be recovered."
When he said, "It might be a shame," the TISK said, "We're worried that this adjustment will prevent women from working on it."
The new rights intended to bring birth or birth to working women were transferred from the Commission to the day-to-day discussions.
In the next six months of the birth, working time, or free leave, has become the most common issue in the Commission's meeting of the reforms that led to the first child's entry into employment until the first child was born, and the most common issue was "public employment" in the Commission's meetings.
The CHP Department of National Affairs, Moses Cham, said, "If you bring back local employment, we'll be against the end if you bring it back to the end."
The Commission, who attended the meeting on behalf of Turkey-Working Ennis Badajdio, said, "We have doubts about how the workplace will be filled."
He said, "That's why we're going to look at the progress of our own volunteer offices in the future."
If TISK Secretary General of the United States Pirler, when he indicated that part-time work had been completed for five years, he said, "No longer part-time work has been done in other countries."
Look at that.
"You have to think about the consequences of this application in places where 1 or 2 work."
TUBB also told King Ahmet Shaƒüar that while the application was going through, the worker found it difficult to survive.
≈ûaƒüar, who said that there is no matter where the rules apply during the mid-term work, said, "It is necessary to make a distinction between workers and employers when planning their own services."
Text Feydom: We Do Not Support
Feyzioƒülu's explanation is, "We are not involved in this announcement, we are not able to join and support it."
Because there's no connection to the PKK.
You couldn't say anything to the PKK if you didn't have a lot of space on the division. You didn't put a dust on it.
And just the heavy statements that have been made in government, we don't see them seriously, and we don't find their way.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
We will follow him if there is a fair deal between those who represent the government, those who are responsible for their duties and the security forces in this context.
When we say, "Don't break the government," they attack us as "Partner, Fascist".
When we say, "This government must act in accordance with the law, and the law must always be superior," they say, "You are making divisions."
We're drunk.
We're always responsible for telling the truth.

Who's Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name was Belgin, was born on 16 December 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of her mother and father, her mother settled in Ankara in 1966 with Sebaat Chakra.
After the new Yunus Emre Ilkokulu, the Ankara Government Conservatoire entered the Piano section, but for the sake of financial difficulties, he worked on PTT for a time.
In 1979, he accepted his offer to work at Feyman Night Club, where he went to play with his friends.
The Feyman Night Club, together with the Group Lolomotif orchestra, met with concerts from the districts of the Turkish Sanat Music, Turkish Hafif Music and the mode of the revolution.
Bergen, who went to Adana for work after Ankara, met Halis Serbes here and married a year later.
In 1982, Atlas Plak released the first long-distance "Var" from the Atlas Plak.
Bergen, who did not rely on her husband‚Äôs violence as she continued to leave the convent, often ran away from her husband.
When he was working in Izmir in 1982, he was beaten to death by his husband.
In this attack, the other song, "Kimbular?", which lost its only eye and lost a large part of the body, was confirmed by Kengiz Ozszeker.
By 1985, the founder of the Viz≈°eker, who had been the owner of the exhibition at the Royal Palace of Pavyon, along with his patron, prepared a demo tape called "Kardez Kader" and sent it to Yashar Kakeva.
Kekeva, who likes Bergen, invited the author to Istanbul.
The first professional longplay on the Istanbul market, "Human Severse" was awarded in honor of "The Girl of Pains" at the end of 1986, the founder of Burhan Bayar's music management.
The album was awarded in November 1987 with the title "The Most devilic Arab Women's Witness" to Altƒ±n Plak and Altƒ±n Kaset, which was not very popular with the album.
He spent the same year in front of the camera with G√ºl≈ün, Asuman Arsan, and Meral Niron in the film "The Girl of Pains".
Bergen, who had a great surprise, was finally rescued from the stone attack on Adana that he went to for the concert.
He also produced the albums "I'm the only God", "My Love Betel" and "I don't want" under the leadership of Selami Shahin, √ñzer Shenya and Cengiz Tekin.
In June 1989, the husband, Bergen, who had also lost his husband, turned to the scenes in 1989, while he was living with my last album, "The Years of Affetless".
On August 14, 1989, the founder of a popular album, who started to acknowledge the tournaments, was murdered by Adana Pozent√©, who was released on August 15, 1989.
The country was defined by Mersin.
Bergen, who spent 29 years in a short life playing five longplays and 11 tapes with 129 songs.
The arguments in the way the author, who, with a different and powerful voice, made his signature, gained the truth from the first day after his death that the "Giden Youth" album was released.

They're going to be restricted to bicycles
However, because there is no agreement between the two countries, most Syrian immigrants will have to return to Russia at the top of 20 degrees.
In the months of writing, a group of passengers, with the need to be safer and more flexible, went to Russia and from here to the north of the country, from Murmansk to Norway.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow restrictions to be imposed, the movement was restricted by bicycles.
Norvech now decided to send these graduates back.
That's why Norvech's security has been advised to fix the bicycles that have been abandoned after the ban.
The "Turkey's 3 billion" crisis in the EU
TURKYE runs a crisis of EUR 3 billion for citizens.
President Jean Claude Juncker, President of the European Union, urged Italian President Matteo Renzi to block the fund to be transferred to Turkey.
Juncker pointed out that the EU has to find 3 billion euros, indicating that the spirit is not good between Europe and Italy.
Juncker, "It's not for Turkey's money for Syrian students in Turkey."
We haven't reached three million yet.
"It's a matter of the integrity of the EU, and that's why it's important."
Juncker said he was expecting the money to be completed until 26 Ocak, the date that was given earlier.
Italy takes a position between countries that take due care of the situation when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources have seen that Rome's financial package situation is not really a threat to Turkey and that the EU Commission and some countries are dealing with problems between Italy and the United States.
I've been living between Italy and the United States for a while.
Renzi, energy, banking, and the last EU summit on immigrants, and later the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU were forced to make it a hard language.
Juncker, who added Renzi's version at the press conference, "Let Renzi A.B."
"Renzi, who I love very much, is wrong to lower the EU Commission on every occasion."
Juncker made sure Renzi was playing in the inner room.
The 3 billion euros promised to Turkey will be received from the US budget.
2 billion euros will be generated from the Member States' budgets.
Germany will spend at least EUR 427 million.
For political reasons, it was decided that the Romanian Government would not transfer money to Turkey, with a view to using the EUR 2.3 million resource in support of the Land and Lebanon.
The source is expected to be used in the period 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw Chalie Hebdo's cartoon
The Russian official news agent, Abdullah Kurdi, spoke to Sputnik, and said, "If you want the truth, I've been crying for this caricature."
He said, "I felt so bad."
After the armed attack, the French historian Charlie Heddo, representing freedom of expression, said:
They've done a bad caricature, Malesef.
Everyone was so sad about this caricature.
He's a 2-year-old boy and he's dead.
To Aylan, my family and I were supposed to respect Charlie Hebdo, but it was completely different.
This report should show respect for the dead children.
The Prophet has been published in a disrespectful way to our master.
They spread about Allah‚Äôs revelations.
It is a small thing for Allah and His Messenger to have a son.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, made this call: "I will call the whole world and the world, and all the children who die should be respected."
They should not grieve the pain of losing their families.
The moon Kurdi still lives in Canada, and Tima Kurdi was one of the characters who showed up in the cartoons.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau is one of the winners in Germany when the three-year-old Syrian Islan Kurdi, who shot the dead body in a signed cartoon, was raised.
As Mr. Muhammad's cartoons were published last year, it became a room for discussion about the cartoons that Charlie Heddo spoke of by Aylan Kurdi, which led to a rape by 12 radicals.
In Karikattur, Germany's capital of Cologne, was not depicted as in women's tattoos during the year's celebration, as they were in the women's tattoos, which attracted the women's haircuts and to the movers.
It's actually part of a 4-cool column, which causes different differences in social media.
He writes on the column, "It's not French," and according to a lot of reading, he's making more hostility with other values that have been attributed to France.
On the other hand, the caricature has caused a lot of people to blame Charlie Hebdo for stealing.
Charlie Hebdo's report, also published last year, gave Germany 800 thousand bribes, and he made a request to the French immigrants to open their doors.
In Karikat√ºr, when it was called "He's been very close to the House," he wrote "Two children's menu" in the advertising section.
The Germans who died in Sultanahmet in Germany
According to a news report posted on the website of Der Spiegel, Germany's Federal Security decided that 10 people who had died in persecution were brought to Germany.
The funerals of the dead will be held by a plane to Germany's Air Force today or tomorrow in the country and in the atmosphere.
In Germany, experts from the Commission for the Identification of the Federal Criminal Bureau (BKA), which is responsible for criminal proceedings, are going to countries where the identification and autopsies of German citizens who have died are normally punished or persecuted.
But Der Spiegel wrote that this time the situation would be different.
According to the report, officials from the Federal Criminal Bureau have applied to the Turkish authorities to ensure that the work of the dead is carried out in Istanbul, but the Turkish authorities have not accepted this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Bureau sent four experts after the Istanbul attack to Istanbul.
The seven wounded in the attack are in the German tourist hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood lost his life
A well-known political theoretical and socialist historian, Meiksins Wood, put his mind in mind, especially with his important work on capitalism roots.
In 1942, Latvia, which was born in New York City, was also published in Turkey by Meiksins Wood, who was born in Mexico: Escape from the class -- Capitalism Background Culture -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- Capitalism Kake of Capitalism -- Desktop Impairment -- Back to March
Streaming air conditioner for safe men
In the German press report, the social workers in the country are indicating that they have been informed by the refugees of the message.
In his statement to the WDR, Mr Schnapka said that the social responsibility for the record that a few of the perpetrators did not want to punish the offenders for their conduct was informed in three languages about the values that were important in Germany.
She added that she would not discuss the value of gender equality of Germany's values, and that she would punish all kinds of rapes and abuses.
On the other hand, it was established in Rheinberg in order to be able to live in the close-up to the Karnaval crossings of the Tactical scandals in Cologne.
In fact, he was told that the carnival tranche had been canceled because there was no guarantee of the survival of the explosives.
What are the benefits of doing so in the morning?
The rest of the people are populating up with a technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals.
For hundreds of years, the most highly preferred drying techniques in the Far East have become stronger and easier to digest.
The bacteria and microps in the bones, which are completely removed from the environment, as well as the problems, such as malnutrition, are completely dead.
The protein, cellulose, and nutrients contained in the fish are completely absorbed by this technique, and this makes food more comfortable.
Do not sink into the oven when it is in a low pressure; the oven doors or the refrigerators are made into the refrigerator.
The amount of water and the duration of the drying are less than the amount of water used in high pressure.
This can be shown as the best example of a weeding train.
In particular, it is necessary to wait for well-stamped filters in order to clean up the holes, such as those in the ground menus, and then put them in the filter.
A deep well is filled with water in a three-square area and is placed in the windscreen.
Tenzer's mouth is left shut.
That's how the storm gets out of the lake.
The fire of fire is first brought to the highest level by bringing water to the water, then by bringing the fire of fire to a lower level.
For about 10 to 15 minutes, the bones and bones are controlled by a catheter after a good bite.
The reasons for this are taken from the dock and placed in the gates.
It's a healthy way to see the brain in the wind, not to change color and smell.
You're going to have the same taste as yourself.
So the quality and pleasure of your food will not be compromised.
At the same time, one of the most economic means of recovery is the loss of fish at least.
And there are many more living and living things in the garden, and there is a good way to visit them.
Especially is this method preferred because it is the softest method used in diets.
David Bowie - Blackstar: "son" Album of the Space
We know you're going to die, to do that last album before you tell anyone, to make the bed of death, to bring you into the state of a physical expression you've taken...
It's like this; we can look more like a fly for the world's fans.
I'm talking about worldly fanatics because I'm among those who believe that the man who does this is immortal and that he's gone.
And from the other side of the earth he came to Our earth; now he has returned to his mother's womb; and this is what is the interpretation of what is true.
It came because only Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga had a spirit that needed to be given to all world designers.
His job was broken down.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes prize: 9.99 TL 5/5
He probably got rid of him from Warhol, Kubrick, from the same planet.
When Apollo 11, Ay, he decided to say, "It's something I'm a stranger," and he joined us by saying, "Space Odity."
Actually, he didn't. He's always taken a few steps ahead.
A lot of people have found ways to lose her mind.
And the musicians and the audience...
It's also wrong to say "only music" for a music, if you're going to leave it to a place where you're going to be interested in plastic works.
The characters that come from the song and create the poetry; the sendings, the novelty, the painting's discography is a universal expression for me.
I don't understand what the glam rock's father is or the corner of the punk...
So, what's the harm that that's been in love with those electronic movements since she was a child?
David Bowie remembered what the word meant by the word "icon" to our mouth these years ago.
He wasn't a man, he wasn't a woman, he wasn't a man.
It was a body.
We had a mission for a while.
That's the body; my 26th studio album was released "Blackstar" two days after it was released.
Before my album was published, we heard "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" trying to negotiate with us.
We thought, "He's dead now, he's talking about death," and he knew everything.
One more game...
The album's message and emotions were previously published in addition to the wonderful "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", but it was re-registered for this album, "Sue" (Or In A Season Of Crime), "'Tis A Pity She Was Was A Whore" when we released the four songs we knew.
I want to say, "Girl Loves Me," "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are very good songs.
When we're all looking at it, it's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's just like "Blackstar" made with so much infatuation and sense...
Neither death nor a "recording with history" album...
I'm just a real "son" album.
"The End" is the letter of a music life that has reached the end from the beginning.
Turkey was targeted in the Sultankhamet attack
Germany's President Holger M√ºnch of the Federal Republic of Germany was in a program that included in the first channel ARD on Tuesday in Sultanahmet, Sweden, and explained that his 10 German citizens had lost their lives.
M√ºnch, the target of the attack was not German troops, but Turkey.
"400 KIZEDS"
But M√ºnch pointed out that Sultanahmet's attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, he said, "We are still under a serious threat."
M√ºnch pointed out that the number of people who went to Syria to participate in the ISIS from Germany had been reduced, and that many people had returned from the war areas.
M√ºnch, who said that it was a major violence in the form of security teams, said, "There are almost 400 dangerous people we don't need to keep in my custody right now."
M√ºnch called for better coordination between police organisations in Europe and for closer communication.
The Turkish authorities identified a live bomb that was designed to launch the Sultanahmet attack on Syria and a member of the ISIS, and said that it was not yet identified by General Thomas and Maizere.
Your voice reminds Aksu of the scenes.
In his 40th year with the concert series, Sezen Aksu grew his love for the "Sezen-Years" concert that he gave in Volkswagen Arena tonight.
The first section of the concert series, which was organized in the month of Tammuz, was held in Volkswagen Arena from 15 to 16 October.
At Aksu's concert, all the listeners have been on a 40-year journey from today to today.
In addition to our personal life - style, our country, and our world, our love of music played a part in the public music.
Aksu, who said he was going to give up his life after he made his promise to the concerts, was disappointed.
In the "Sesenic Years" series, Sezen Aksu, who has filled Volkswagen Arena with a different story every time.
He took every story, show, light, and stage watch to the football stadium.
In the final part of the unforgettable concert, a video was also produced by Devreim Erbil that took place in Istanbul's tables.
Aksu also placed them in his first-time video show, which he recorded before his first surprises.
In Ankara and Istanbul, I've got 25 rounds.
In Ankara, 250 grams of ice 25 by day, it started to sell from 1 TL.
A new year ago, especially in the middle of the mid-month, the words "the end of the winter" were expressed in terms of G√ºdde, Culture and Animal Health, with the Blue and Ticaret, "No Time."
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of eggs were sold from 1 TL this day.
Turkey's French Federation, on the 25th anniversary of the summit, said Hail Ibrahim Balzi, "The deadline has not been reached, the tariff decision has been applied 2 years ago," and added:
"This was a price decision taken two years ago."
The Esnaf Room Unit designated this rate two years ago.
It's a prize for Turkey.
I mean, a new time interview was made, and it wasn't going to increase the price.
But in Ankara, he sold 75 coins in some regions of the country.
In some areas, it was already sold to 1 TL.
In the meantime, he didn't have to pay a cheap price to be trusted in his uncle. We have to apply 1 TL from the library.
No more or no more.
They're up to an unused price.
"In the first half of 2016, the price of an extra kilogram will definitely not exceed 5 TL and we'll end up with this year without a lot of stress."
In some areas, Istanbul has begun to sell to 1.25 TL.
That's when the terrorist found Burkina Faso.
In the West African country of Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 countries have lost their lives in a remote hotel, known as a hotel chosen by foreigners and United Nations officials.
The attack was launched by El Kaide's North African arm.
The outbreak in Burkina Faso occurred four days after ISIS, with 250 million refugees, the world's largest Muslim country in the world, organized by the President of Indonesia in Cakarta.
Foreign emissaries, luxury hotels, and stores were held in Starbucks' shop and at the police point of day-to-day bombings and armed assaults; a Canadian and Indonesian life ended.
The Indonesian authorities explained that the attackers were inspired by the Paris catalytics on 13 November.
The British BBC television's security director Frank Garner noticed this action, and in the past, many of the world's giants showed themselves to be a scary piece of training.
The U.S.'s blood was burned shortly before the terrorist attacks.
In the beginning of the Middle Ages, 14 people were killed in an armed attack designed by ISIS in San Bernardino, California, U.S.A.
"San Bernardino" attack on the United States
In Sultanahmet, where 10 German tourists died after a live bomb struck by German Prime Minister Thomas and Maizere, and in many parts of the world, "we lived in Paris with two major attacks."
If we say that, then the terror will be won...
We used the word "before I step back."
Whatsappa talks about the abandoned Arawi application
According to a new report, it uses its own means of communication to communicate independently from such chat applications as IKID, WhatsApp and Telegram.
Defende One's report says he's using a new communication application to communicate between himself.
This "Alraw" Android application is distributed and loaded in the form of a APC file.
The application recognizes that the content of the message is encrypted and media sharing.
With a flashlight in Iraq from the ISED
The application's activity is "uncovered" against popular applications, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, according to the Ghost Security Group.
The power of the encryption is unknown now.
IT WAS the first time that I was able to carry out a Telegram application that allowed me to send all my messages over encrypted connections.
But the Telegram, ISIS members, had their channels of communication between them.
In addition, the U.S. administration requests that the back door be set for applications from application developers.
That's why he's now starting to use his own solutions instead of trusting whatsApp and Telegram encryption.

How should the holiday season be assessed in the evening?
How should the students evaluate the qualifications of half the students? We asked the Professor of Education and the Professor of Education, Murat Aydƒ±n.
It's only for students who have lunch; listening, having fun, watching television and computer time, and not thinking about it.
It's a very important opportunity to prepare for the new course and review the course of the past.
It is also an important opportunity to develop personal development, knowledge, skill, and taste at the same time, which is called free time.
Make an appropriate evaluation list.
Write everything you plan and try to apply.
If you're sure of this, you'll take advantage of it, and you'll be able to make a generous summer tour.
Now, let's talk about how we have a computerized circuit tour for students who are preparing for the YGS-LYS.
Because the most common questions from our friends who are prepared for YGS-LYS trials are, "How should we evaluate this cycle, how do we solve a lot of questions, or do we have too many issues to deal with?"
Let's get in writing with advice to friends who have been first tested to answer these questions and to carry on a given period.
We're trying to complete this in more than one year, when the test is going to be a period that starts under normal conditions from the 9th grade, and this becomes more effective, data and time, and we're forced to spend more time in the last year.
The final class student must also carry out school writing work along with the preparation of the test.
Even if the student has entered at least 1 test (YGS-LYS) every time he completes his studies, the year he prepares for the postgraduate trial is critical to him.
Because most of the message student and his family are going to see 'O' as the last chance of the year, and this leads to greater stress.
It's a job to work; it's a job for a student who doesn't take pleasure, and it's just because he feels strong, and it's usually because he's always left out, but it's a job for those who do it, who do it, who do it, who do it, and who do it for the rest of their life, who do it for the rest of their life, and what it's always about when it's going to be done.
Now we have half the talent, and we need to appreciate it in the best way.
And for that, there must be a plan that will allow us to manage our time properly.
Average years in full - time ministry:
Everyone needs to plan their own situation first.
On the 1st floor, what's done, what's gone wrong, the day, the week, and the 15-day schedule.
There must also be a repetition of the matter within this period, and there must be a question-solving.
At the same time, students who do not have a lot of efficiency can do an average test of 1-2.
Find out what you're dealing with: Research: 75 percent of people learn about it in one week, 66 percent in a day, 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to remove the memory is to do it again.
In particular, those who make a lot of mistakes in the past should be seriously concerned with their overall work.
First discuss your issues and plan day-to-day, set a day-to-day event, and make them happy.
This plan will comfort you both academic and psychologically.
And make sure that the most mistakes you make are the ones you've made when you put them into your plan.
Because in the future, you're not going to be a long-term dancer.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
It's very important to resolve the matter until we do it again.
Because we can see how much we do our work, but we can only see the changes we take through the question we solve.
Don't forget to put a certain number of questions every day.
The number of questions you're going to solve may vary according to the work you're going to do that day; you can't solve a lot of questions on the day you've done hard work, but at least we need to make sure we know how much we know about that day.
Solver Tests:
Another job you're going to do in half a year should be to deal with tests.
In any case, you can do at least training tests, even if it's not all over.
So let's say, you've made the Turkish language in a large area, you can solve the Turkish language tests of 40 questions.
And do your best while you're doing it.
If you can solve the 40 Turkish question in the first 60 minutes, you can solve it in less than a few minutes if you can get your next target.
Tali And Hobi Plan:
It doesn't mean just to work; it's a couple of days you have to separate for a couple of days to relax, relax, and enjoy.
It's just that you're just going to have a satellite tour to work and you're gonna stop listening.
That's why there must be special times you're going to split up in your plans.
Reading books, watching television, surfing on the Internet may be within your plans, but you will determine how much time you will spend.
I'm going to have a little advice for friends who said I couldn't spend the first time on it.
If, my first time wasn't very good, I didn't work too much, and if you're saying too much, it's a great opportunity for you guys.
But first of all, you have to make a decision and believe it.
Turkey's football superseded between 76 and 90 minutes between 2009 and 2010.
Now you answer the question you're asking, and you're going to the funeral room, or is there a lot of minutes to go up there?
I don't think anyone wants to say, "We're going to watch the games in front of us."
The only thing you're gonna do now is leave the past and look forward to, not running.
We're gonna collect what we're saying:
( 1) Plan a half-calculation plan,
( 2) Do what you know is right and do it again.
( 3) You've done your best.
( 4) And resolve the issues,
( 5) And resolve the trials,
( 6) Study the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?
( 7) Identify new goals for the new cycle,
( 8) Spend time with yourself, your hobbies, your pleasures,
( 9) separate time between your family and your friends,
10) Spend time in social and cultural activities (synema, sports, theatre, concerts, travel, picnics, etc.)
'Kervan' has gone a long way
Each averaged 45 yards [1,000 m] and one of the largest "home" stores in Turkey's largest "home" stores, the cousin of Cherwan, Demirel and his son Hasan, went out on the 17th floor, and 25 stores in the 17th Street.
In the near future, he owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores outside the city.
"Now we're going to have a bigger store with Kervan and a smaller store with home Sweet Home."
"Kervan will be opened out of the country," he said.
With 50 million lira in 2015, Kervan and 90 million TL in conjunction with Home Sweet Home, the Cyrus Circus, produced about 140 million lira and produced it.
The total sales area of Kervan, where there was 45 games in 35 years, is 45,000 meters.
The 25 stores are the parent company.
I want about 500 people in Kervan.
And Home Sweet Home has 17 stores outside 25 cities in the country, and the total sales area is 6 000 meters and 320 people work.
"We've entered this sector in 1998," he said.
Since the beginning, we've had a brand between us with the support of Chinese Members.
It's 'TRT' in this sector.
We've learned a lot from him.
We even started giving our first step to the store by giving us his Ak Merchez store.
We've been working as a strategic partner, not as a rapist with Kervan.
He said, "Now it's going to be a very serious synergy with this alliance."
He explained that he now found 17 stores outside the country to be at Home Sweet Home, and that he also began to live in China last month.
"We've opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We agreed with a 200-storey syndicate.
"Then we're going to develop a large store outside the country as Kervan, a small store with Home Sweet Home."
He's selling his factory in Poroshenko Russia.
Roshen CEO of Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who reported on the issue, said the factory was sold for $200 million.
Moscowsky, "Yes, we sold the factory."
He said, ‚ÄòIt will not produce seed, and all the truthful ones will be destroyed.‚Äô
As for the price of the company's factory located in Lipetsk, Russia, Moscow said, "We've appointed nearly 200 million dollars."
In the year 450 thousand tonnes of chocolate and sugar produced by Roshen, one of the world's largest producers and Ukraine's president, Peter Poroshenko.
The star Holding went out of town, Pladis.
Star Holding has united global companies that are active in the sectors of beer and chocolate that have been sold under the name "Pladis".
De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and the World Marks were born in a new debt of $5.2 billion.
In a meeting on the integration of global companies across the Star Holding World, Mr. Murat M√ºllker said, "Our goal has been to be a global company since we started," and added:
Murat G√∂lker, 335 million lire sales of life from Periscope
72 years ago, this company was founded, and now it's called Star Holding, which is going to be global brands and global companies in the world.
In the meantime, we grew up in the fields of personal observation and variety of species, from the point of view of the sugarcane sugarcane.
We're at the 77 factory operating in 14 countries, with 300 brands and thousands of sales points.
"Now we want to focus on our mother's work and be global in this area, and we are reorganizing to do it," said the G√ºnker, who said, "a loving family of 50,000 people."
The life story of Sabri Bey's father
We reassess our company, we reorganize it.
We have divided the world into regions.
And we shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our CEOs.
Mehmet Tenth, Central Turkey, K. Africa and the Turkish Communities.
Mohamed Elsarky, a case from the United States of America and Japan in the context of our global Godiva work.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for England, China and Africa.
I can call it a kalite and an innovation bridge, Ali K√∂lker, while delivering a global message on his own, Cem Karaka≈ü will also help me in my work.
China, Russia's part of the South East Asia, will be the areas that we will build and develop.
Murat Walker sold his hair at SAF GYO.
His words, "We're looking for happiness all over the world in every summer," said Murat Wilker, "the name of our global firm, Pladis, which we have created to achieve this."
"Where do you think you created Pladis, in fact, that name has no special meaning," he added:
They call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name of the seven-star Pleiades Group of Pleiades.
I mean, we've translated the world of Nassips into the world.
He also launched "we started to create synergies in innovation" in cooperation with laboratories in various countries, and added:
We have very valuable AR-GE teams, bringing these teams together, and we've got at least some engineers working on an AR-GE platform.
We have 27 Ar-GE stations under Pladis.
This is the biggest in Turkey and England.
This is where our dear AR-GE agent works.
He even started to give his results to the synergy.
The digestives, which was created in the country and which is to start war on England, is created in Silivri in the world's chocolate factory (Nibbles).
Another example is: The brands are different, but the products are the same World Crispy.
A cracker technology developed in England means that we have won our country under the name of the World Crispi Trottic.
Laviva, who knows us all very well, has met some of the girls in America today.
The Call of Duty series opened 250 million lines
This series of activities, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer games seem to have been known as the world of gold, and for years.
In particular, the number of new sales that have been revealed has shown how far we need to find the details.
The Activization, which includes the license rights of the serum, showed 250 million copies of the order that was specifically distributed at the end of the year.
In the beginning of last year, the company that shared the sales of all the series was able to sell the 75 million-addicted Call of Duty.
We don't make a lot of mistakes if we're making a big part of this black ops 3 game.
One less-fashioned General has been elected
Kemal K√ºlterang was again elected president in Kurulta.
He's been the president of K√ºlƒçdare, who played 990 of the 238 delegates who used the game.
Of the games used, 248 were considered invalid.
After the outcome was explained, the parties were at the show of joy.
A total of 275 members of the CHP were present.
Kurultay finished his work on meeting at 10 a.m. on Friday.
He said, in particular, in his infamous establishment:
We wanted you to play games here and tell the Turks.
But it's not an opening at the point we're coming.
There's a truth in Turkey that doesn't control.
The atmosphere that's happening makes all of this go away.
The reason for the Karamsar table is that they manage the country.
Wherever you come from as the CHPs, whatever you come from, we're against.
Terrorism is a human offence and terrorists must never be forgiven.
It's smart to fight terror, it's smart, it's smart, it's ironic.
Of course, we're going to fight, and we're gonna want someone's face to be washed.
What's the difference between the photos in Syria, the photos in Lebanon, the photos in South-East?
They made serious mistakes while sitting on the table.
Achan‚Äôs blood, his sight, and the rest of the dead were responsible.
In 2002, they took the country with zero terror, and today there's a blood issue turning into Turkey.
Who is responsible for this?
Is the taxi driver in the world, Chehmuz?
What's he paying for Turkey?
We're going to attend meetings regularly as regards the change of wages, and we're going to talk about our ideas.
We're not gonna let anyone build a country on personal visits.
I say, "Let's change the working spirit."
This country's bright ideas are being put on the streets of the morning, and it's being taken to the front of the house.
We also have ways we don't have to participate, but people must be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator says, "He ate the state's ashes and hated the state."
And I want to ask him, why don't those who have eaten the government's bread and benefited from all the government's opportunities?
The biggest change in the CHP is the party that brought to this country.
We'll always be ready for the fourth major revolution.
Whatever the case, we're going to bring democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can take care of us, they can do whatever they can, but no matter how difficult it may be, this country will be free from the CHP.
I'm calling you openly, David.
Don't hide behind the law, the man who kept his job didn't abandon his work science.
You gave him a higher service fee.
What work are you talking about?
Let's just go get the people out of here.
The party's experts set out another three revolutions: the formation of the Community during the Great Revolution, the creation of the Soviet Union at the end of World War II; the return of the party from the single party in June; the 3rd revolution to social democracy with B√ºlt Ecevit...
He has the qualities and duties of the Chief of Staff.
There's 103. It's the food of the mayor.
We know how important my nose and respectable face is in this group.
If a person goes out and gives this word, he'll put it in his death.
Because soul and honor don't belong to us.
The guy who's a dictator's obnoxious, he's got a respect and a sense of humor for you.
What do you know about hope and honor, why did you make this meal?
What do you mean by the smile and honor?
I want to know.
A religious man has a reputation for honesty and respect.
It's not their intention to remove labour law, it's their right to work.
They don't want the presidential system.
How's the president; the boss-in-chief system.
Why are you rejecting Osmanley's parliamentary system?
Everyone's gonna do their best to order a man.
Are parliamentarians working well in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring free democracy, the system works.
They call it work, but they strengthened their work law.
Mustafa Balbay, the nationalist of Izmir, explaining the aida for the general president, was unable to fight because he did not collect the signature of the 128 delegates required for the order.
Balbay, who can collect 92 signatures, said, "I don't have a chance in the circumstances."
In the Kurultay hall, the nationalists took note of the presence of parties (PMs), the centre of conduct (MYK) and the members of the honor-making community of the former CHP Leader of the Seaz Baykal party.
And instead of sitting in an open place for the people, he sat next to the place to which the President of the General was sent.
Yalova was one of the subjects discussed at the conference with Muharrem Ince, K√ºhlzd√•lu, the nation of Yalova.
In fact, he said he didn't accept that he was offered a PM member.
But from the general center, it came to the idea that the meeting request was from Ince and that the PM membership was not proposed.
In fact, he shared his message from Twitter, "Whoever can learn these general city resources, the content of the meeting can be learned from the Istanbul national Ali √ñzcan."
And he said, "How could I have known before I met two people?"
"I've met him."
It's not funny, it's got it all the time.
On the first day of the "Democratic, Change and Brotherhood Curulta" that happened, the party meclique (PM) was shot.
He started working for the PM list after he spoke at the office.
While preparing the 100 key lists for K√ºlƒçdel√∂lu, it was learned that the current members of the MYK were told that they would place 13 MYK members outside the PM, who did not want to take part in my administration, and would not apply to PM, Jakop Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, and Ercan Karaka≈°, who were once again known as PM, and called the MM, calling their 13 MM members outside Erdoƒüdu.
It's indicated that the mouse can mark another list of 100 people on the PM key list.
The 21 material result adopted by the CHP Kurulta was requested to remove the threshold on the European Local Government's claim for a day-to-day debate with DTK's private talks.
The report also set out the goals of "the end of the state of the party", "the establishment of a government that can account for a legal basis".
Kurultay's assistant General President Selchuk himself, HDP's Idris Baluken, and MHP's Ruhsar Demirel.
The AK Party has left its seat on the establishment of President Erdoƒüan of Kl√º√ßdoroglu.
He said to himself, "I can't accept it."
"If you don't mind me, the arrest reporters in the Salon, who took photos of Can D√ºndar and Erdem G√ºl, took care of the Pankart with a map written by Kurtc, Turkish and English "Bargh".
In the morning of the day, the group started singing Yorum and Ahmet Kaya.
The President Baro, who spent his life in the armed persecution, received a message from the Turkish Ambassador's wife, Tahir, who sent him to the institution of the Turkish Apostle.
Berkin's mother and his father, Sami Elvan, joined in the funeral.
It was the most interesting part of the conversation that would have to be paid if you had to pay for what you had to pay.
So far, 34 of them, and 18 of them gathered at 52 institutions, the CHP, 53 largest institutions in Ankara arena today.
The height of my connection.
There were more than 15 pounds of CHP in the 12 grand column.
However, there was no excuse for the majority.
The most exciting time was when Kl√ºchdoroglu's wife, Selvi Kl√ºckd√•lu, joined in the salon.
Heyesan continued to greet the K√ºhlzd√•lder's couple hall.
There was no lack of discipline at the AK Party's offices in the hall.
Even when we were talking, there was a great movement in the area on the side of Arena.
Apparently, the CHPs, party managers and journalists who wanted to join the Party chose to call for support.
A CHP manager tried to explain that the situation was not bad by saying, "It's better that the parties who think it's a party meeting in Korea or soviets in the United States can't stand it."
There's another difference between the CHP facility, the AK Party or the MHP facility.
Only the general presidents speak in these parties.
And in the CHP, it turns into a platform where party issues are discussed.
The majority of the parties who wanted to talk in the South were too busy setting up the period of President Divan Murat Royal.
There was also a conflict in the hundreds and in the languages, with the expression "The country is going bad" and "You're changing the table from this room."
All of the CHPs, "Let's do something," and "What to do," had no strong evidence.
It's a big effect that no choice will be made in the next four years.
When it came to the cross-section, we expected the journalists to answer the question, "What should we do?"
He said, "What's going on?"
He took note of the case of the Tutucul journalists, the fact that those who had been educated on the basis of the information, those who lived in South-East were concerned about the absence of foreign policy.
He has long defined "unowned parties", "integrants", "participants of the list" as "a party".
And when he came down, "What to do," he tried to put "strategic" between him instead of saying a lot of things.
He pointed out that all of these problems could be dealt with in a more just way with greater democracy.
He also made a promise to the CHP and said, "We'll do whatever it takes to bring democracy."
He said, "We're going to fight death for democracy."
One last note; it must be remembered that the CHP has dealt with the "organization" issue in its 53rd session, and that it can now hold the meeting together without problems.
Meanwhile, a map was printed for 900 journalists who said they were going to follow the show, but I wasn't at that level.
The media organizations, including Ankara's representatives, did not want to follow the institution as far as the AK Party's institutions were concerned.

He said, "There's no guarantee of tomorrow, though."

FedEx's debts are broken, the money will fall in 2016.
For three months, FedEx reported the consequences of the loss of vision for the past three months, and the charge rate, the reduction of demand for cargo services and the increase in local services.
The company also said it's planning to take about 55,000 seasonal workers for tickets.
In the past few years, FedEx has been informed that he will get 50,000 seasonal workers for the tattoos.
Nearly 2.5 minutes before the launch of the day, approximately 2.5 minutes ago.
FedEx Corp. In the last few months of May, he indicated that $10.40 was expected to win between $10.90 and $10.90 in the final year, which was 20 percent lower than the previous estimates.
Analysts were waiting for $10.84 on the basis of a factset study.
4 Although it is likely that the average level will increase by 4.9, and in the severity or severity of large packages, it is likely to fall to high levels that will begin in November.
According to the company, there's a higher margin of credit, and it's expected that the winners will still be higher than the previous year's growth of e-commerce.
The president and CEO Fred Smith said that the company was "a healthy performance despite the low economic conditions of the world's economy, despite the expectations of the economy and the world's markets."
The satellite's plan was announced one day later by the UPS company, so the same number of years ago, 90,000 and 95,000 extra workers were planning to take it.
On August 31, three months in prison, FedEx won 692 million dollars a year ago, 692 million dollars.
Hesse's winner, Zacks' Investment Research, was conducted at $2.44 last year, at $242 level, of 12 analysts who were found by the study.
There's an increase of five, $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks were waiting for $112.23 billion.
FedEx, a member of the nation of the past year, got back to work in the premier, and that's why there's been a slowdown in the Express unit.
However, the disclosure of the revolutionary trader FedEx Local Services has raised the results.
In recent years, local services have increased by 29 % but only because of large packages and high rates of permanent accommodation.
When high-ranking employees came to the job in charge, they saw a high-ranking voice coming up because of the high-frequency events.
About an hour before the opening of the opening, FedEx's feelings turned to $3.85 or $2.5 by $15.15.
On Tuesday, they closed down by 17% under the record rate of 11th and 11th of Haziran for the year.
At the most expected meetings for years, Federal Reserve politicians decided that it would not be possible to increase the time of increasing the rate by about two days this week, spending 27 days on a table in Honduras, almost ten years ago.
It will be the wall of the United States of America, a two-room meeting room located in a corner of the Central Bank.
It's a reminder of the fact that fed's women's president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have kept their national economic outputs on everything else.
The central bank has two tasks from Congress: to make the U.S. will the U.S. and keep the prices stable here.
But since the Great Britain, Fed's admitted that there's been a third campaign that hasn't been written by the leaders.
And this third anniversary may be an X factor in a close-up decision that will be announced on Friday, 2008 when the United States economy, which is to be heard, has not been expected to begin to break out of the short-term phase of the unprecedented terrorist support.
Although most data show that the economy is growing in a healthy way, the latter can still contribute to increasing the number of people currently paying attention to global financial markets, the reference federal background figures - even in less than one percent of the world's income - about increasing corruption.
"It will be the first and most important thing they've seen in the market and inflation," said Stephen Nicolaus & Co's chief economist Lindsey M. Piegza.
He said, "But I think if they are looking for a treasure to increase it, it will provide them with enough certainty to wait a little longer for the global market."
There's no consensus on what Fed's gonna do, and this leads to what's in his own financial markets.
In the near future, half of the economists that Bloomberg saw this week were waiting for an increase.
Along with this, the financial markets expect Fed to stay in the waiting room with his mother, who shows only about 30 percent of the possible increase.
This situation, while Fed's area is expanding, can indicate a drop in the paper market if the policy makers don't notice the effect that another increase could have on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index averaged 228.89 pounds or 1.4 times 16.599.85.
Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski said, "It was prompted by the expectation that the different Fed politicians would maintain their place this week."
He said, "It would be amazing if Fed would now increase what's happening."
If Fed's managers were to decide this way, they would have to take a long year to settle the financial markets so they can panic.
Other experts pointed out that Fed would be able to settle the financial markets because of the rise in the flow of the link between the sixth and the next generation.
Only a month ago, Fed seemed to have made this month an increase of 0.25 pounds; this would have been a small step that would have strengthened the collection of the U.S. funds by slowing down.
Yellen, despite the economic needs of liberals, said he was expecting this year's rise in months and writing.
Despite the decline in the job creation rate in August, the increase in the labour market took place this year.
In the last month of unemployment, the lowest level in seven years fell to 5,1 and the level that Fed wanted was close to.
She showed signs of maestro repair.
And although the inflation center continued to look under the target of the year %2, Fed politicians said that there was an important reason why oil prices were gradually reduced.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said that the economy "is able to cope with higher odds and need this despite the fact that the labour market is in decline."
But in the last month of the world's financial markets, China's money went to a devaluation.
Due to the fear of global growth in a slow Chinese economy, the average level of the Dow Jones industry declined to 16% in May.
Piyasa, when Dow's high level is now below 10% in May, somehow dropped back.
Fed's payroll for policy makers makes it even more difficult to calculate the time when the fashion is going to increase.
UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate research partner and former Fed member Stephen D. Olinner said, "They may have been involved in this meeting in the financial markets in China for a few weeks and the lack of information on economic failure."
Now he predicts they will wait for at least one month to manage these effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen in the US economy, and there is almost no data in his hand to link the progress of China's history."
The global economy's health is not one of Fed's primary concerns, so it should not have been in the process of cutting back technically.
But actually, Fed has become the world's financial asset.
The impact of the central bank has been great in recent years.
Since then, President Ben Bernanke's only tip was to "response" the paradigm that led to Fed's global market collapse in 2013.
In a world where markets and economies are moving towards one another, it can be expected that Feds will not only follow the developments in other countries but also talk to other central bank managers and experts to read the global economy better.
The property management company Investnet Inc. said that the decision-making process of Chief Zachary Karabel's global strategy was "a lot more competent than my knowledge."
The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. President Jeffrey Lacker observed that this month "Fed's financial market movements that are not linked to economic foundations" have been overextended in the past."
For example, Lacker, who was a member of the Open Piyasa Committee, who was a member of the Committee on the Law and was a member of the Political make-up, for example, under the 1998-99 decisions.
Lacker said, "Despite limited advice for the growth of the EU, the financial crisis in Asia has led to a reduction of $0.75 in the three meetings of Fed in Asia."
A year later, Fed's officers returned these orders.
Adam S. Posen, former members of the Central Bank‚Äôs Central Bank‚Äôs assessment committee, said, "Fed should only put financial concerns ahead during major crises, as it were during the 2008 season."
The last thief said he wasn't approaching this level.
You really don't want to stay in a state of fear of going to an increase in payoffs because the money is too high, Peterson said President Posen of the International Economic Institute.
I don't think that the Central Bank's building has two assets and a bank account, and I don't think they should be in this direction.

Brazil encourages health care during the Rio Grande Pediatri Commission of the European Communities
Brazil's pediatric medicament, SRS, and women's health care, introduced a shocking approach to children's birth pictures, which are not well illustrated in health care, to explain the importance of health care for women.
Human fat, many proteins, water, vitamins, and carbohydrates have come into play that also provides all the bones needed to develop a healthy diet for babies.
It is suggested that women and pregnant women, because of their energy needs, raise the daily calories of their new mothers to 500 calories.
According to recent studies, the pregnancy rate for mothers is not limited to calorie intake.
According to a new work carried out by Professor Robert Waterland, Texas Baylor and College College Professor Robert Waterland, pregnant women's health benefits have prevented their babies from developing tumors by affecting their genetic expression.
Sad to say, it's the child's immune system that has been affected by malnutrition without the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise, despite Nine's leadership in today's show, he's making progress in states.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson did not succeed in making a stopover for Canberra in order to change the leadership of Liberal Lisa Wilkinson.
After Tony Abbott's attack on Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's coffee was presented to the national president.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage, spoken in London, were intertwined between Dubai, New York, Niagara Hills and Cancun's weekly national schedules.
Just as the issue of distance is not much different for Australian observers, there are 397.000 monitors in the middle of today's 339.000 fronts compared to the five fronts of Sunrise.
Today's Easter Day (317.000) was the day of the Day of Atonement (283,000) when the Council (283.000) recorded a slight increase in the states, but the number was still in the end of the past Persebbe (343,000)
In the last months of today, it's closing up with Sunrise.
In August, Sunrise's 330,000-digit average today was 318,000.
The difference at the beginning of the year was between 40,000 and 50,000.
The average Sunrise is 349,000 today, equivalent to 314,000 today.
It's the most interesting thing that's been doing all morning.
The exchanges are very much under way this morning's parliament!
Karl and Lisa are good, thanks for asking!

The great news for Seven was the launch of the 800th Word by Erik Thomson, the year-old editor of the Raffers.
With two children of a new blind father, the new drama reached an influential middle of 1,219 million in New Zealand, with the decision to move to the coast of New Zealand.
The editors asked that Thomson's Rafters wouldn't be a solo show without Rebecca Gibney's uncle.
Last night was a "yes" answer.
Seven's X factor was protected by 1,136 million monitors, Block (838.000) and TBL's families (726,000).
Seven mixed up with two Takip-Austuralya.
Andrew O'Keefe reached 446,000 observers in the middle of the first half hour of his new information contest (17:00-17:30).
In the second half of the hour (17:30-18:00) my number was reduced to 623.000, enough for a small possibility against Eddie Mcguire's Royal College (6131,000).
In the second half of the night of the first half hour of Takip-Australia, the number rose to 720,000 in the second half of the second half of the watch.
He's got a good Koltuk average of 620,000.
Takip thought Australia's second night's retiring down to Nina at 5.30.
Takip Australia was a change in the millions of dollars that didn't pass on to McGuier's shadow.

The last three of them think Bekar Sam Wood is a perfect man, but who will choose him?
Did he go out in the middle?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackya and Snezana Marcoski may have been among those who won Bekari.
Sam Wood was in a big secret at the end of the Bekar program.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell you who the last laughing area is.
But the day before the three of them fell into two, we'll check Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Macky and Snezana Marcoski, and they might have given a clue about who the penalty would be.
Sam Wood Persebbe has washed his mouth to the end of the day.
Three women also explained why Wood was perfect in a Lilongwe language, and they said that they wanted to be his partner in helping him to be a good partner in his performance, in his performance, in his wealth, in his family values and in his positive attitude.
But if you're not, who's gonna get Wood's last smile? They may have some information about who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Marcoski quickly gave them the name of Macky as the best sign for Wood.
Sarah Macky and Sam Wood have been very close since the first day.
Jeavons-Fellows said, "I've been home since I came home, I've felt that they've been in harmony with Sam's energy, and I've been thinking about it through the program."
Marcoski added, "Sarah is very practical, very happy to be around her."
I saw them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable when they're with each other.
Sarah Mackya thinks she and Sam Wood are going to be a very well-known couple.
Mackay said last week that he thought he was a "true man" by the house-to-house meeting.
He said, ‚ÄúWhen I saw him, my friends and my family, I realized that this was not just a game, and I am now totally connected to him.‚Äù
Otherwise, when he was asked who Wood could choose, he was hiding.
He said, "I don't know if he can say that."
"I love the other girls alike - they're Snezana and Lana."

First issue: Is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
There were different options from the location where Jerryd Hayne started his NFL career.
After Detroit and Seattle moved to the U.S.A., they took a lot of interest in him, and a lot of other teams approached him after the day of the public training.
But Hayne San Francisco 49ers and driver Jim Tomsula chose, and this looks like a very wise decision.
Some of the horses sat in the tomb because of the loss of their performance on the Australian coast, as it may have been on Monday against Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed this man and met Hayne with a more opportunity to play after Reggie Bush's silence.
After Tomsula played, he continued to show the true color in his bedroom.
Instead of putting their fingers down in front of the whole team, he gave them a chance.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-mortem press conference.
49er team leader Cam Inman said that Hayne's private team coordinator also took care of Thomas McGaughey and forgot his fall and was advised to think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne, the first time I saw Minnesia Vikings, why did he get the number, and he fell.
This was not what Hayne and his extensive Australian adventure kitten had imagined for the first game in the NFL.
Well, when he went out of the field after the ball fell, he saw it and later told Australian radioman Hamish and Andy that he didn't think of a worse start for NFL careers in 2DayFM 104.1.
He said, "It was just one of those things, and you're sorry about the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also recalled the first match in 2007 with the back-up in Queensland.
I still have a great test for this 27-year-old player.
In fact, after the game, the shot was released at Instagram while holding an Australian airport with its sides.
Elton John and Russian State President Vladimir Putin will come to a close meeting on sexual rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested in Siberia for his armed assault.
President Vladimir Putin was imprisoned in Khodorkovsky's open-ended prison, the oil company's hands were short cut off from Yukos and the wrong efforts of democracy were made.
Nepal Police Protetoculament Plastic War sequence Results 4 Killed
On Wednesday, according to an expert, the police fired four men, including a 4-year-old boy, to the police, who had offered him a new mother in the country, who offered to fire the police with plastic bullets.
On Friday night, President Katmandu arrived at the town of Rupandei, 175 miles away.
The senior officer, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said that a phase-out protester from 1000 gathered outside a police station and threw some stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used beer gas to open the air before using plastic bags.
He said the police and five civilians were injured.
He knows he's dead, but it's not clear why plastic bullets used to be less deadly than an alternative.
The conflict has been the last of strong protests that continued for weeks in Nepal's southern regimes, and here the members of the Madesi ethnic group are moving forward to monitor the political impact of the newly formed regions that have been offered by the new mothers.
The ethnic group of Tharus who wants to build their own states is also doing protests in eastern Nepal.
Since August 10th, at least 40 people have spent their lives in the violent conflicts that have taken place since August 11th.
In this history, four major political parties have agreed to divide the country into regions - it has been important for centuries to prepare for a new motherhood in Nepal, managed by the central government.
The work on a new mother has continued since 2008, but the legislators have given up this time after the devastating earthquake that struck the city in Nisan and caused thousands of people to die.
Ordomakers worked on their mother-in-laws this week in Katmandu, and the authorities said that the new text would be prepared until the Passover day.
NHC says it's possible 60 percent of the Cape Verde Islands.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Central Circuit, the Cape Verde Islands' south-east of 350 miles (560 km) to the south, said that 60 percent would be expected to turn into a tropical hurricane within 48 hours.
Another well-known low-pressure system was seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilleans, and Miami's central air traffic forecast is probably 60 percent in the two days ahead.
Starts a donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for Google students
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has heard a charity campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for thousands of people who have fled from war-affected and poor countries who have fled to Europe.
Google has led to an unexpected personal admission to the blog.
Instead of making this statement by an administrator, Rita Masoud, a Google worker who escaped from Kabil when she was seven years old, wrote her own personal experience.
"There were plenty of cold, cold, and fear of hunger in our village," he wrote, "and there were many dark buses and trains."
I was lucky.
But it's possible to help a lot of families like my family because of the growing civilisation and the migration crisis in Europe.
Victims, immigrants and immigrants will go to a four-time non-profit organization that will help them: Borderless Doctors, International Rescue Committee, Children Rescue and BM National High Commissioner.
Google said the first $5.5 million will be compared to google.com/refugeelief.
Europe, 2nd World War, to face the worst civil crisis ever, is the Syrian internal war that took over 4 million people over this year, four years of age.
He's running away from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, who are suffering from many wars.

In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, weight loss may help
According to a new study, the benefit of obese surgery in type 2 diabetes mellitus may be seen in the following five years.
But it's early to say that patients with moderate diabetes are not able to live longer and live with patients who have not seen surgery after surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article on JAMA's new work on surgery and obsessive surgery, "it takes a long time to identify itself."
Kilo loses operations, in other words baratric surgery, uses various methods to reduce media pressure.
These reduce hunger and limit the body‚Äôs ability to digest.
Within years, type 2 diabetes mellitus have been shown to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in 35 or more obese subjects.
The BMI, which is measured over a kilogram, is normally accepted between 18.5 and 24.9.
25 or more of BMI shows that the person is more than a kilogram, and those who are on 30 BMI are considered weak.
You can count BMI on this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Tayvan, the highly grateful Min-Sheng Hospital, has used two types of brittle cancers that have been used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients since 2007.
The average activity since the end of the fifth year of the study has risen to 24.5 BMI from 31.5.
That's right, the BMIs of those who see surgery-out-diabetic treatment remain stable in 29 circles.
Of course, in 36% of patients, it was totally 28% solved.
In the treatment group, the diabetes mellitus is not completely resolved on %1 and only partially on %2.
Also, according to authors, blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "lowness" were generally better in the LDL cholesterol group.
Researchers have shown the blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which in patients at the same time inhibited blood sugar levels.
Researchers say it's best to keep A1c haemoglobin below 7%.
After treatment, A1c haemoglobation increased from 9 to 6 percent.
In the medical treatment group, 8 percent of the population is stable.
But with the levels of A1c hemoglobin, it's a better "glysemic control", according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his team friends, who are conducting research, has not been killed in this five-year period.
The findings of the investigation team were compared with these two types of operations.
In the fifth document, there were more than one kilograms (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (%3.1 to %2.1) of higher concentrations were observed and it was likely that all of their diets could be recovered (%46.9 to 16.7).
Although the study did not indicate that after the end of the five-year period, the post-operative operation was beneficial, Dr. Blackstone, from Arizona, said that it was valid for a work carried out in more kilograms of patients in Switzerland for the duration of the operation.
In this Swedish work, another 29 percent of the obese patients diagnosed with baratric surgery were more likely to die within 15 years of their deaths.
Even though this new work has not shown what the benefits of the survival of patients with surgery are, Blackstone says, it's a safe haven for people under BMI 35.
This is also the most exciting part of the article, because in a vulnerable BMI group, there has been no increase in the risk of death or renal failure, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should begin taking the matter seriously by falling to BMI 27 and 30.
I think we've waited until people take this seriously, he said.
I think it's really hard to turn this into the opposite after these genetic changes have been collected around the world, which have made their bodies obsessive and diabetic.
"It's impossible to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dali Lama, who tells all citizens of Europe that they can't afford a home, added that the real solution is in the Middle East.
Tibet's head of Buddhist leadership was called for the end of violence in the countries of the country.
At the beginning of the 10-day English visit, Dalai Lama, who was to work on ethical issues, changed to a topical crisis that continued in his speech at the opening of the Lama Schefkat Merket in Oxford.
Under existing circumstances, it indicated that human outputs should be planned in advance, whether from countries or from countries.
At the same time, however determined, it was also pointed out that the country's administrative implications for the Western European crisis were insufficient in the context of this situation.
He said in his speech, "It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe."
As far as Germany and Austria determined their efforts to cope with the crisis, Dali Lama said this was only a temporary solution.
"It's great to deal with a few thousand students, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring about lasting conflict and lasting progress on the basis of my education."
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of power.
I've never solved problems with my use of power."
In changing the issue of the drought, Dali Lama also changed after George Bush's 11-year-old attack, and asked that the U.S. government had begun a series of uncontrollable events.
After 11 months, I sent a letter to President Bush to my health wish, and I said that the solution was through non-violent ways of solving the problem.
I know that his powers are well-intended, but he used his power and why the consequences were unexpected," Dali Lama said.
4 times in the last 4 years in children's anti-semitting movements
The oil control centres in the United States of America have reported an increase of almost 400 percent in high levels of alcohol consumption among 12-year-old children since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Georgia Zehir, director of the Central Bank, the hand-tighted wave that has been observed in 12-year-old children is reaching 16.117 in 2010 from 3.266 to 2014.
Lopez CNN said, "Children have been more prone to these types of products, and it's sad that there are hundreds of them to be removed soon."
He told some kids that they knew about their antiseptics and that they did this in an effort to influence their friends or in social media.
Videos on YouTube show antiseptics for soft drinking.
It has been reported that some adults have mixed their antiseptic relationship to get a stronger form of alcohol.
Little kids can get caught up in the antiseptic noises.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of those who are more exciting than they are.
Children have the latest high-level antiseptics of fluids, wines, and portal environment.
Where the antiseptics look, it's between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, it can only be caused by a few bursts of alcohol.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, president of the Center for Disease Control at Kansas University Hospital, he gave Fox 4 television to the city of Fox.
You don't leave a few regular whiskey bars in the middle, but people leave these antiseptics in the middle, and this is a very easy way to get too much alcohol for the kids.
In recent times, only four times in high school, he was quickly removed to see six - year - old Nahijah Russell, who was only four years old.
According to Dr. Chris Ritchey, this was two of the legal limit of alcohol received from a mature adult.
Nahijah couldn't keep his word and he couldn't walk when he came to his emergency room.
According to Rithey, the doctors kept him in a separate hospital all night before any brain trauma was identified.
In her statement to the CNN, Anne Ortoria Scott said "he was very scared."
He could have been a killer for my child.
Lopez suggested that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or contact the body of antiseptics and remove children from places where they could not reach.
Besides alcohol poisoning, it was seen that some antiseptics were associated with death wounds.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died because of wearing an antiseptic device containing an unexplained name.
Health experts have pointed out that the substance, not alcohol specified in the list, can be methyl alcohol, which can be deadly.
In November, three fourth-class students from north New York were prepared to celebrate their "little heart" teachers in New York City with the aim of "setting antibacterial products around the class" in order to attract the police reports.
The teacher claimed to be used in class because they're allergic to antisepsis.
The plan before the police is designed to promote discipline by calling the school administration a "go-go-go-go" class.

Saudi Arabia did not quit TUBITAK
Science, Science and Technology Centre's concept of Light, Turkey's Scientific and Technical Research Framework (TUBITAK) has established a new agreement for the second party sales to Saudi Arabia, saying "the number of Baltic States serving in Saudi Arabia will go from 6 to 14 in agreement with the development of the 8th system and the acquisition of its structure."
It was clear that the TUBITAK Space Technologies were in statements about BALISTICA, developed by the Research Institute.
The light from the system, which shows that the weapons used in the events of the regime have been used and that the fighting has been compared to the ballistic intruders and the data found on the central data base, thus preventing the problems encountered by the ballistic scientists when they have examined the linkages and the mercenaries.
The light, the information obtained from different geographic locations, and the information collected from each other, indicated that BALISTICA could not be questioned at all.
BALISTKA's most important feature, more detailed and less accurate three-dimensional data, was highlighted by the Light, which noted the ability to obtain and display, as part of the innovations that the system introduced, could quickly take decisions that could be made by the Baltic authorities and that the success was much greater.
BALISTKA was introduced to the "SUBA-1 Project"
BALISTIKA recorded that all the criteria for success were met and that the Eminiet General was fully noted by the Director-General and that the system set up in 10 separate regions had captured Turkey.
Light, who wanted the system to open up as a result of its success, recalled that the SABA-1 Project, carried out with Saudi Arabia, was launched by BALISTICA and that it was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
Apparently, BALISTICA said that a new deal was made for the second party sale to Saudi Arabia, indicating that the SUBA-1 was signed for the purpose of the SUBA-1, and that the SUBA-2 system was to be developed and the construction of the 8-year-old system would serve in Saudi Arabia from 6 to 14 years.

The paleontologists explained that M. rex, which is thought to be the largest time living in the sea, was buried in mud.
History is thought to be the greatest sweet water tank, 110 million years ago, living in Africa and South America, and it is thought to be the "Sarcoschus emperor" that can reach 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
The first book of the 1996 author Ece Temelkuran, "The Head of All Women," was inspired by the same name by Aisa Produksiono Theyatrosu.
The game that is played by the Sea Cacra, Zeynep Cankon, the Red Turk, the Red Creak and the Red Cross and the S√∂nmez S√∂nmez are played by Selen Uzer.
The first time that the games called 'Poz' and 'Puntu' continue to be written and managed by the F√ºhrer's first time, he asks about the conflict in women's heads.
The game, last week, met a spectator at the Trump Show Center.
The game starts with the radio theater.
In the dark, a voice that brought us back in years...
Then he opens the door.
A woman living on the side of the window, shooting down.
It's understood that who is and why he's risen up, that he's doing business with his neighbors.
A CONVERSATION WITH A NEIGHBOR
A popular writer, the "Ebru Uysal" that the Sea of Cacra has revealed.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
It's been in things since childhood.
The lack of a father‚Äôs love, the lack of learning, the lack of understanding of his past childhood, the lack of understanding, and the lack of understanding.
He decided to leave a letter behind, but he can't jump off the couch.
Because a woman who is a blind woman who is standing up against 'Aysel' (Zeynap Cankon) and who is on the side of the wall, 'Perran' (Sebenm S√∂nmez) despises her.
Normal, they're approaching me like an event.
She's still coming and she can't go to the council.
In the middle of the third round, the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya', who cleans the house, turns into a good cook.
'Meltem', which is more breathy and symmetrical, can't be able to sing the song when you see most of the people below.
This interesting entrance wins a different size by entering the girl's house with the key of the "Murat" (Kadir Cermik) key.
Curiously giving false information to the press of 'Meltem' is out of the question.
The song of Nazan Early is also used.
BUNALICAL DEVELOPMENT
For the first time, F√ºhrer managed to make the game faster and more smart.
The game's comedy's load is drawing from Turkey with Zeynep Kankone.
These are the types of caricature that the two of them breathe; the need monkeys can laugh at the viewer with the necessary replications.
While Sibmen is very good at transferring the years' effort to the stage, the Sea of Cacra is a promising performance in order to weaken the depressed spirit of the 'Ebra Oysal'.
Kadir Cermik, who talks about the performance of Tolga Creik's award film, has successfully cooperated with these four women.
The only casual game that is described as a comedian is to laugh without a headache.
Most of the people who come out of the mouth of 'Perran' played by S√∂nmez say, "They read the act; they don't live, they see.
All the children, the parents, and the parents think they're going to die once and then they're always crying at the end.
The woman is in the air like an incomprehensible joke.
The woman always calls for a funny reminder that she's forgotten her most important place.
In fact, every dream begins with a kind of release.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket, and I can't listen to the dumb things.
He's wondering where he's going to put his hands.
When we're surprised, our hands are shaking.
People who speak from the back of their minds and hearts often lie.
It'll be a mistake to understand.
All women's heads are confused because they're confused.
You have a chance to live because you don't want to die.

Probiotic activity has an important effect to our cancer, and when it is severed, it prevents harmful microorganisms from attaching and spreading to the wall.
There are many diseases caused by the deterioration of the level of healthy microorganisms in the atmosphere.
In the form of proper feeding, the breast cancer must be protected.
And to do that, we have to do enough probiotics to do it.
Removes the selected problems from the list.
The unbelievers are the most powerful probiotic bacteria in the world, and the beneficial bacteria in it have a constant effect on the strength of the system.
The beneficial bacteria and minerals in the liver make it possible to multiply and to be healthy.
And if they cry out for justice, they work, and if they cry out for help, they cease, and there is no fault in them, and there is a better resurrection.
A healthy lockdown system means a healthy and disease-free body.

Putin, he's lying.
While Russia was preparing to identify Turkey's services in a way that would not otherwise be opposed to Turkey's services, it also stated that the Russians are not leaving Turkey.
The Russian Economic Development Agency, which estimates that the blockade of existing economic ties with Turkey will lead to further financing for Russia, has prepared a new "Istituary Situations" for the Russian Government with regard to Turkey.
Even if I enter the area where Russia has to do according to the schedule published in the Russian Federal Administration Directory, it is unlikely that the Turkish companies and companies will be allowed to work with Russia.
It is estimated that it will be impossible to obtain from other sources other than Turkey or that local production in Russia will result in a significant increase in production and services of Turkish companies and companies.
The karma commission will identify which Turkish intellectual property and service will be included in this category with the other departments concerned by the Russian Economic Development Agency.
So the choice of which Turkish company can work with Russia will be made by the bureaucrats.
According to the same document, private companies in Russia will have to demonstrate to the Commission that the work they are going to do with Turkish partners is not worthwhile.
The map will also be produced in Russia by the Russian government in order to allow the entry into force of the document.
Russia's Tur Operators Unit also expressed its wish that the Russians did not leave Turkey today.

We left the last month of 2015.
Russia's government President Vladimir Putin hears that after the crash, economic developments will be even more serious.
In those days, our workers who worked to get to Russia, our THY personnel, were throwing images at the border gates.
Turkey's money is being spent on gold. It's keeping track of what's not clear.
It's not a long time ago, it's been a month, and it's been a day since Moscow.
That's what I do or that's what I do.
But why?
Why is it so simple?
In a global economic call, you're no longer trying to turn political disputes into an economic war.
We're still going to write to Iran about how the economic embargo has been under way for years.
He looks like a friend like Russia and Turkey, but he's really kind to two neighbors who don't.
It's not technically possible to steal these two countries from each other on such a night, with the entrance to tourism and the client.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter one another's country.
The best thing to do is to build a political debate on the table without the newly created Reza Zarab (Sarraf) on the table and count it there.
Before the economy's broken...

In contrast, I know that Esad will not be removed from his assignment in the near future.
That's what she needs to talk about, and Russia needs help in this prison too.
A deafening protest to the blind
On the 59th of May, which was played by Medicana Sivasspor, Burak set up protests until he reached the post target of Sneijder, whom he wanted to give to Sneijder.
On that account the Ark did not move, and He showed His signs to the people who were at ease.
Later, the attacks increased, and whenever every mob came to the foot of the shooter, they heard protest sounds.
Some tribes later supported Burak in Islam and protested the side of their players who had acted in ignorance.
Then he supported a large part of the tribes to the Valley of Shrine.
Dedicodus Case: There is no inconsistencies in Celtic
Deila doesn't care about saying that Hopes is in a bad place and that it's gonna come up with it. Griffith doesn't care about the words of failure in Celtic.
The fight of the calpere, the punishment of the SFA to Neilson and the unity of the team, with the gravity of Warburton's arrest against the Occult signatures.
Leader Don's made the difference with Celtic.
Adam Rooney's first half-pants brought Aberdeen to the Pittudrie in Hamilton, and gave Don a five-pound creative opportunity between himself and Celtic.
Griffith, I don't care what you say.
The statements made by the obstetric dedicator in Celtic indicate that Griffith's hands are in the wrong place and that he and his team friends are not under any increased surveillance sense when they are preparing to meet the League Leaders in the Netherlands.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I'm in the corner where players are impatient for this.
There's no conversation between the Scots in the Netherlands that bothers Boer's life.
Rangers' former middle-class player and former football player Ronald de Boer in the Netherlands says they lost their relationship with the Celtics because they didn't have a record of their football players in the Netherlands.
De Boer, an Ajax apostle at the time, said, "Why don't they give themselves to Celtic games in the Netherlands now?"
Because Rangers isn't there anymore.
People don't just talk about turning Rangers back.
They're talking from the old team.
They're talking in groups, they're talking about it.
Those who wanted to watch the games in the old team games were not just the Scots.
I'll fix things, Deila promised.
RONNY Deila Celtic agreed to fight, but the Norwegian boss said he'd turn to the opposite.
The campaign against Malm√∂ and then the champions followed the game that was lost to Aberdeen at the five-pound table immediately after the League.
But Deila said, "There have been terrible days in the past; we shall return."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know it's a very imaginative situation and a lot of people are angry or sad about it.
We're in the same situation, but we just have to keep going.
We really need Celtic support because this player feels much better.
Now it's important to stay together.
The gravity of Warburton's Occult Transfers
Just two weeks ago, despite the positions of some Ocak transfer targets, Rangers' boss is afraid of signing Mark Warburton's signature, and regrets that Ibrox doesn't want to break the team's union.
The old Brentford priest said, "The transfer window is very different from the writing window."
For the players you've written, I've got a season before you've hired them, and we've seen it in our own group.
The team's really fine.
Sometimes it's more painful to add players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu in the harvest season.
Swansea was connected to Celtic in the Michu transfer window from the front of the Swancea forts, and was able to clear up the chances that he might be able to negotiate with the Towers when he finished.
During his 29 years of life, he lived in pain-free from a troubled foot-and-mouth disease and did not find a way to get out of Gallery.
Words are ready for the SFA's performance on Neilson's terms.
When Patterson was fired, the Hearts were 2-1, and then 3-2 were lost, and the defense player turned everything in turn -- Collum's third red card in eight months.
Neilson doesn't give up what he says, but he says, "I never questioned the unity, I didn't make a point about performance."
Griffiths tried to advance Tynecastle
A song about Rudi Skacel, an old-fashioned Hibee, is being sung.
The event occurred in March 2014 in Tynecastle, Edinburgh, just before the trial in Edinburgh, in a bar in the Roseburn region.
"There was a shot and there was a heat in her mouth," he said, adding, "I can definitely say that after that, I'm not going to Tynecastle, but to play with Celtic.
Tannadic building Dundee United is secure management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly, the Dundee U.S. administration still has confidence that the team will improve its operations, but they agree that it must end the drop in the field.
I think Stephen Thompson trusted us.
We'll get the kids back on the way." Donnelly said.
Welcome to McClness Hamilton's "winning"
Derek Mclness acknowledges that the Aberdeen team's first half-pound of Adam Rooney admits that they have to be held in despair against Hamilton Accices, who led them to a five-pound strike at the top of the seven-point battle.
Mclnes said, "There's no team that won't win anything in this shape unless you're in the middle of it."
The number of incidents of unemployment in England was the same among the Scots
THE rest of the world in Scotland, while not changing from 164,000 in May to 164,000, rose to 1 82 million people, with a total unemployment rate of 10,000.
According to the International Statistical Office (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 percent higher than in England and 5.5 percent higher.
Eight of them fell in Scotland within three months, and the number of people who are now working is 2,612,000.
I want it to go down to 74.0, which is the average in England over 73,5.5.
State Secretary David Mundell, who is responsible for Scotland, said, "The government's long-term plan laid the foundations of a stronger economy."
It's almost a whole year since the day Isaac decided to be part of England.
For 12 months, we have seen progress with the increase in demand and the reduction of unemployment in Scotland.
Why I'm a witness to a man in Oklahoma
In the coming hours, I'm gonna watch a man's murder for a late legal trial.
I don't hope so, but if there's any, I'll sit while Richard Glossip's dead injection is under surveillance of the Death Room in Oklahoma City.
He wanted me to be one of four witnesses to his death.
Dave was first made by his best friend in October, and I accepted, no matter how shocked I was.
As the day drew near, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted it because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It's going to bring an unexpected turn of events.
True, journalists are allowed to monitor American attitudes, and there is more application than there are, and there is a fear of choosing who they will choose.
Oklahoma's media boots fell off by 12.
Whoever is chosen will follow their feelings without being caught.
I can't do this.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a relationship with him for the last few months and for the last two hours of a visit.
I love that man.
We laugh very often when we talk.
The officials in the prison told me that I would not be a witness and a journalist, so I'm not going to be able to record what I've seen.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A ecstatic journalist accused me of being a spy on me on Twitter.
Here you go.
Tell the judge the story as he likes it, you win it.
I called her.
And he admitted, "You can do it better," but he still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip, it's not what I'm saying and I'm writing.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list when he asked for it.
But a country wants a mayor to be there and write these.
If he dies, he thinks that this will help the death penalty.
He'll be with me, too, Kim Bellware from Huffington Post.
If you want to learn more about this, please listen to the podcast series I've prepared.
I'm not gonna tell you all the details here again.
I don't have a definite opinion about Richard Glossip's guilt.
Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make himself a criminal partner.
But I still believe he's not guilty of his own crime.
I believe there is no sufficient evidence to show a death penalty.
I think his mind is wrong.
And I'll watch his death with this prospect.
I can't say I'm going to be a real target.
That's why you can look at the other guests there.
The surveillance you'll get from me will be the surveillance you'll take from watching the death of a man who likes to be killed in an unnecessary manner.
The man was confirmed by Canning Nehri after the police arrest.
The Canning Vale police officer, he's been arrested while he's convincing the man from Canning Nehr.
A man in Perth, trying to escape from a cop's car behind him, ended up trying to convince himself to come back to the river.
The Canning Valley Police were called on Tuesday, on the grounds of being free to enter Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to escape from the police to Canning Nehri.
But he wasn't too far away.
He said, "The Chief Commissioner's assistant, Spartan Castle, is standing in the water and 'I'm not going to go out,' he said, 'Get me out.'
Police Memuru Lachlan Perahvec refused to release his uniform and used a more secure tactic -- "good police conversation".
The Chief Commissioner said to Castledin, "some people are trying funny things to try to escape."
Champion footballer Ben Cousins has a permanent example in mind.
In 2006, a police officer left his car to escape alcohol control and stopped crossing Swan Nehri.
The teasing failed, but the local people were inspired by the planning of the Ben Cousins bithlon.
Peter Moody pointed out that the cats threatened to spy on themselves and stop fighting.
Peter Moody said that Racing Victoria's victims had been trying to prepare an order in their own end last year and threatened to leave him immediately.
Racing took Victoria's cards and the department of unity and said that they had been carrying out a personal campaign against Lady Tatai in their last commitment to win the war on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the contests, and he told Lidari that he found himself in the strong steps he couldn't explain.
He said he didn't want to "see it like wild grapes" for 18 months.
"I won't tell them, and I've stopped them for a long time, but sometimes you're so excited and everything's going to be together," said Moody.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you react and you stick to its consequences, and I'll stick to the consequences I'm telling you.
I'll sleep well when I go home tonight.
I want my head up and let my boss know that I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
When they start thinking that I didn't do it, it means I don't have to start running anymore.
I thought about what I could do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a joint department in a raping.com report that accused him of being in a spy store.
"Two months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man -- I call him if asked -- and they asked him what I did to them about what I did to them in my neighborhood," said Moody, Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a triangular.
If that's the case, they've got to put everyone on their knees because they weren't as good as they could catch me.
RVL's former president Robert Roulston, RVL's new president David Moodie and RVL's current general management knew that too.
Does this make me think it's starting to be personal?
Does RVL have a number of groups, and maybe anyone outside the drive would want to ask what's happening in the intrusion?
I'm bad for the press?
I'm so bad for an engineer?
Maybe people out there think I'm like that.
Maybe they need my license and I need to get out of here, but I don't know what I'm saying to them.
But I don't care about anything at the point I'm here, and I'm sorry.
This really hurts me.
I'm going to press on them, I'm going to charge them with a decision.
I have my family's support and I'll walk.
For a long time, the operator's continued cobalt questioning and the mental confusion that led to the next incident led him to say, "Put my license in front of the desk,"
The most successful Moody watch day in preparation for the unrenewed champion Kara Havyar said the rule was "fashioned" and it meant that it was contrary to the rules of wearing a sword or a bow.
This is contrary to the rules of the contest.
I have to bear all of this."
One of my men was hit by a snake in his feet.
He could have taken it tonight.
It could have been yesterday. That's what happened.
He took the day of the battle.
Moody, at the end of the investigation that the managers have opened up, he can stand up to receive three months' punishment for the use of tobacco on the Wednesday.
That's a joke.
Those who do these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We know we need rules, but it's gone too far."
A flight driver stuck in Cobram
The police arrested a man who ran a bike in Cobram last week.
He was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after a car crash in Murray Vadiz in the Autoyole in the morning.
The police told him he ran away from the scene without helping the wounded driver.
On Wednesday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was transferred to Shepparton police station.
It's expected to stop in a accident, help and blame the other traffic crimes.
At 40 years of age, Cobram's bicycle continued to remain stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm gave a strong response to the allegations of Craig Bellamy's records
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm trainer, described his team as a "present-day creation" effort for NRL's two favorite units.
Sydney Rousters, coached by Trent Robinson Friday night, said at the end of the afternoon in Sydney that Storm's court-martial court had allowed his team to "do it" with his own team.
The Brisbane Broncos trainer Wayne Bennett spoke as a "birth" game for the football league, and said two Owensland didn't have much "great" in contrast with the two Oueensland after the end of March.
He only said they were focusing on "themas" while defending and fighting the battles of the Bellamy team.
Bellamy said it's because it means that Storm's getting worried about what's going on in the two fronts of the team.
That's what's happening -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson spoke to us in 24-2 seconds, said Bellamy Wednesday.
I'll make sure we don't change anything in our defense systems or our techniques all year round, just in the last six weeks, we've been doing a real shot at our contacts, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and it's clear that he's got a big team he's been doing, and he's probably not willing to lose a little school for himself.
It's funny that it's been on the farm this year.
Bellamy was against Bennett's idea of a "responsive football" and remembered that Bennett had won the 2010 St. George-Illawara Dragons championship by playing "hard" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
Our Friday night game with its own games on Friday night, and how exciting their games were."
I remember in 2010 that St George was kidnapped because he was a tough team, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give the girl.
But now there's a team that's playing football that we can call exciting football, and especially young people with speeds.
This is the football you want to play when you're this type of player.
In 2010, he put that point, and now everyone wants to play football like this -- every team has half like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it's not possible for them to play in this form.
This gives me much more confidence because they're talking about it because they're a little afraid of playing.
When they went to big games, they probably didn't bring us into their minds six weeks ago.
Bellamy also pointed out that Storm and Roosters had a higher score than Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen him yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game is 20 - 18, and both sides of our game are more scoring, but is this exciting football?
Or do you want to cut the shots, but don't make a squeaking attack?
I think it's my day.
If they're talking about us, it means we'll meet them here on a sidewalk.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys, or Cronilla Sharks, won't end this week because of the first weekend of the ticket that sells tickets to the AAMI Park.
The Srop Man was released free of $200,000 from the drug crime scene.
The man who was arrested on a 40 kilogram of cocaine that had fled to Queensland was released free of charge against $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, was one of five people from South America, and he was one of the five people who had been arrested by the federal police for 100 kilograms of drug abuse during the month of August in Coomera.
Maximovic met with his criminal partners in the marina this morning and then met them at Coomera Roadhouse, 40 kilograms of the drug dealer in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that there was no evidence of the existence of cocaine as a potential victim, Maximovic said that he had no evidence that he had access to all drugs, and that he would be able to handle it for a long time.
Superintendent Dr. Peter Flangan Maximovic was concerned about a flight risk.
There are open connections to Serbia.
She travels often to Serbia," she said in court on Wednesday.
He lied about where the police were staying.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather offered 200,000 dollars together to be released from slavery.
Judge Flanagan said, "It is clear that each of the two persons who read their promises of security is making a real financial burden on them."
But he warned him that it was not enough alone to hold him back from trial.
Maximovic, and Australia and Serbia were released free of charge to deliver passports, and to go to Karakola every day, and to meet the deadline of 6 to 6 a.m. on the way out.
Stefan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles into sending images
A pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for child pornography.
Steven Hogg took her phone when he was sleeping, and a translator came in and offered himself a list of inappropriate children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later and found out she didn't have her phone, and she found her phone in Hogg's hand.
He looked at her and immediately noticed disturbing messages before he warned her mother.
The police took care of and saw five images, then analyzed the computers on the address, and discovered the "relative" web calls made using the terms used to locate inappropriate images of children.
Hogg later told me that he'd done this to memmers, so he'd run pedophiles on the Internet and be afraid of acting like a cop.
The property manager Elid Robertson, Dundee Sheriff Mahkemes, told them: "It's a matter - it's a matter of fear of people.
He admitted the calls were made by the computer, but he said he was doing it to scare the pedophiles.
Questions were asked about interviews with someone who did not know how to send pictures to herself, who wanted to send more pictures than they did.
He said he did this to punish them.
When he drank, he said he was caught up in sick thoughts and wanted to watch the scenes of torture and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girls found their messages on the phone, she cried and cried to her mother.
Mom saw inappropriate images on the phone, and the charges followed.
She met the girl and said she used the computer and Playstation to look younger than you thought.
Ward Road, 23 years old in Dundee, has been guilty of taking or producing inappropriate images of children in the 14th year of Haziran, the 25th anniversary of a crime and of not taking part in trial this year on March 24.
The defence lawyer Gregor Sim said that Hogg's being included in the sex crimes category would argue that there was no "known sexual element" in this case.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has reduced the social history of the case to October for the report.
Hogg was released free of charge in this case, but he was kept in custody for other serial killers.
The sex crimes were registered before the court history.
Robert Mugabe made the wrong conversation in Zimbabwe
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell from a podium at the beginning of this year.
It wasn't created, but the enemy's video went to the social media office.
Parliament's opening-up, parliamentary opinion, during Mr. Mugabe's speech, was angered by the allegations that they had taken an anonymous death threat.
The national voice we heard in Parliament last month, they woke themselves up and they cut off their regular words - they repeated the same conversation on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), explained that seven presidents came to their cell phones to discourage themselves during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"Mr. Mugabe's speech comes from a number that doesn't look like a message to the journalists after it's started," he said.
He says that the lack of contact with the members is right in the parliament and that they do not work in the absence of contact when they leave the parliament.
The chief speaker, Morgan Tsvangari, said that the party was "initiated" because of its threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will quit 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will end up with 25,000 jobs and 30,000 jobs in rehabilitating and rehabilitating the corporate services.
HP will be separated from the two companies listed in the years ahead; the computer and the writer will be separated from the larger company and service operations.
In a HP statement, he indicated that the fourth crop of work expected would result in a cost of $2.7 billion.
HP president and executive director Meg Whitman, who will take the lead in the post-departure union, said, "This reorganization will provide a more recognizable and affordable budget for the new Hewlett Packard Company,"
"Whitman, the Hewlett Packard Company today will be smaller and more focused on HP and will be a broad and deep portfolio of help in the transition to the new mode of operation," he said.
As a separate company, we are far better in place to meet the growing needs of our customers in the world.
According to an explanation made by the company, Hewlett Packard's annual income will be over $50 billion and "intellectual technology solutions will be used for companies".
In the 1930s, Stanford University's e-mails were distributed to the garages in Palo Alto, where he was called "the birthplace of Silicon Vadisi" by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard.
HP is running a large reorganisation to access mobile devices from potential personal computers.
This action of HP, one of the world's largest PC contractors and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is one of the last members of the industry's faith that frequent companies have shown a better performance.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arta tells Wilsher that his team friends are in trouble with Dinamo Zagreb before the game.
Wenger pointed out that Wilsher's silence was alive at Christmas and that his treatment was planned and that there was no reason to play during the Christmas season.
You know, the best scenario is that Wilshere will be able to figure out that at least four stones in England will disappear, and that when she looks back, she will not be involved in the future European Championship.
The most embarrassing side of the problem was that Wilshere had completed the last season after a separate foot-and-mouth disease, and then called for the ex-cretion of the season.
This is not a threat to a quiet career, Wenger said.
It's a very unwelcome cake.
It's not big.
It was just a accident.
This has nothing to do with the tickets or the previous silences.
From a medical point of view, these may be correct, but Wenger is also at risk of getting further cleaned up by a player who turns around in the middle of the season, as Wenger will accept.
At the same time, there's a disillusionment.
According to a study by the Premier Creations by Ltd, there have been 23 different setbacks since Wilshere's first start six years ago.
In the last five seasons, the 157 litres of Arsenal were only played in 65.
In a large picture, Arsenal has been one of two First League groups that have been missing since 2007-08 since the eighth season.
Wenger accepts the potential of a short revolution, but he believes that it will continue to improve in the peace record of Arsenal's past season.
"Once you have returned from your rest, it is a time when you will be able to cleanse yourself, strengthen your body and win the battle," said Wenger.
Jack's as young as he can stand under it.
I hope his body is stable, I trust that, and I believe he's going to do what he deserves.
The champions have Tottenham Hotspur games to play in front of Arsenamo Zagreb, which will start in front of Arsenel on Saturday, which will start in the night of the League's victory, and Tottenham Hotspur will play in front of Arsenal.
H√©ctor Beller√≠n and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, this makes sense that they will play with Mathieu Debuchy.
Wenger can start with Theo Walcott instead of Theo Walcott, with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud.
"I invite you to protect the ring and give the player the solution they need," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal's F Group is one of the most popular stadiums in Zagreb, the maximum stadium in Europe is located.
The last season of the dynamo, after creating its own "Smoking" campaign, isn't exactly 41 games.
According to Richter's estimate, the stadium Sunday night was covered with a depressive depression of 3.2.
It's the 10th of a year in Zagreb.
Wenger Arsenal's last season believes that he has received the necessary training from the champions of Monaco in the League, and the success of the club in bringing the first European Cup victory to a far-reaching goal.
"It's a motivation," says Wenger.
There was no such thing in Arsenal.
We're very close in 2006, but I've had enough experience to be real on the other side.
We need to hold on, but we're not amazing.
FriendsFest: Comedy program that gives us serious lessons about human friendship
In programmes, the lack of portraits is particularly noticeable, especially during a period of 15 years between what men needed to open up and the young men.
This was the biggest cause of men's deaths between 20 and 45 years of age in 2013 and women were three times more than men.
In order to address this problem, the Sefil Life Fight Campaign (CALM) launched 2015 as a Human Year and aims to face a culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
There's a friendship in the center of the struggle to make this difficult move.
A study of more than 2,000 depressive symptoms among literate students showed that a person who suffered from this stress had a high number of "healthy moddaki" friends whose chances of improvement were two pages.
Similarly, he brings into the midst of mental violence that can arise from a healthy environment for those who are not depressed.
But, of course, friendship needs to be made available first.
In this call, I have a heavy social media coverage, which is more important than a room with style on the inside, making it more urgent than meaningful communication.
Our digital lives, the need to look like strong, fun and successful people, even if it's really the main insulation of everything.
The values of successful psychologists are beyond doubt, under the influence of money, wealth, and social status; they are, after all, the inner values that are more important to our mental health ‚Äî our personal development and our personal friendship.
As the Creator of billions of video games has explained in the near future, money will not be able to buy more happiness.
The beauty of the friendly list was not turning this room point down.
Not by his work, but by his personality; and by his dealings with his friends.
When Joey and Chandler's frequent beatings, the minutes they watched football in the consoles, Ross' connections to Rachel, all men were aware that even if they stayed behind, they would be able to communicate with them.
A helpful worker told me, "I've seen how even the smallest relationships between friends can be formed by listening to depressed and passionate people."
They don't talk to most of the guys who've been in touch with us.
It's a strong feeling like going out, and it's a sign of weakness to open up to others."
One of the programs that came to mind when I suggested long-term success mechanisms is a set of Friends.
A man's friendship's little brains have been shot.
My goal is to prove that a foreign status on the phone is to help people understand how difficult it is for them, but long-term support comes from families and friends who have close personal networks.
And if you join friendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful environment where the stagers are redesigned to celebrate?
Or, better, if you see only one in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don't know how to make a difference in your friendship.

Di Maria made it easier for PSG to defeat Malm√∂.
Angel Di Maria was celebrating with Blaise Matudi and Edinson Cavani after his defeat in Malm√∂.
Angel Di Maria, at the beginning of the Championships, made it easier for the Swedish team to transfer the old PSG to Malm√∂ on Tuesday.
Here's the game reports and the game stories.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani started at the end of the 2-0 stage of peace and a clean opportunity against Malm√∂ on Tuesday at the Paris St.
In Maria, the golden player was a PSG player who made it possible for the French champions to continue their journey to the League, but at 61 minutes, they failed to appreciate the second chance Cavani had taken with his head.
The Group needed to make a strong start against the Swiss champion of Paris, Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, who had met with the Royal Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, not only to get out of the group, but also to improve the final performances of the last three champions.
But the game they played was not the best game for Laurent Blanc's team, and Zlatan spent a lot of positions around the Ibrahimovic prison area, and he was taken back to the country's team that started in 1999 in a famous career.
"It's not easy to win out in the champions in Ligi, it's not easy to win out, but it's going to create problems for our fans from this point of view, and it's a good start, even if there's some things we need to improve in the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, even though we didn't throw more than one or two bullets, and we won.
Abrahamovic returned to the Paris team at 1st Lig with Bordeaux at the end of the week, with one of the three players who played 2-2 games in the game, but in the fourth minute, Di Maria was on the ground.
When he was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as a higher-level player in Europe, and behind Marco Veratti, the Malm√∂ champion of Malm√∂, followed by a good fight with Johann Wiland from far away.
Together, everyone was disappointed to see that PSG would win a great battle.
The game was driven by a nine-year-old Malm√∂ national player who played Celtic to cross the bridge, with a five-man shield and two players in the middle of the field, a heavy hit.
At 34 minutes, Nikola Djurdjic was attacked by a little more than a little attack on Kevin Trapp's village.
On the other hand, the PSG allowed them to slow down the game with unnecessary passports and free of charge, and on the other hand, Abrahamovic did not act as a last resort for at least five attacks, and when he started the second half, he caused a mental depression without stumbling into the game of Cavani.
He showed that when he came to organize his colleagues, he was more proud, and at 52 minutes Abrahamovic, who was behind the false fight that Di Maria had sent to William's career.
After a full hour, the second ball came to Cavani, and the Uruguayan player, after Ibrahimovic, recorded his sixth hand in the middle of the head of Maxwell's left arm.

Later, the Malm√∂ trainer Age Hareide admitted that PSG was a class over his own team, and the Norwegian said, "We were in the middle of the last year of our champions."
From that time on, we've only played together in the Swiss League, not at the same level.
The teams in your hand aren't enough.
He's being taken to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion of his sales.
Switzerland's central mining devi Glencore has been working on the money market and has purchased $2.5 billion on Wednesday, including its debt sharing plan.
Glencore, who's listed in London, said he sold a new feeling at 1.6 billion Starlin's value to pay his debt.
This year, the company that lost 57 percent of its value was affected by the fact that China's demand for economic slowdown and the reason for confusion in the markets was seriously affected by its prices.

Matt Damon, showing the variety in filmmaking doesn't matter
Matt Damon, telling you you don't have to be behind the camera during a variety of competitions, came up against the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown.
In the project Greenlight Pazar night section published at HBO, Brown's selection of the selected series contained an attempt to provide an alternative perspective on the character of the selected project.
Damon, when we talked about variety, you're not in the player's camera, you're in the movie player's camera, you're in the mind.
"All right, all right," said Brown, as the actor of the Marsley film continues, "that's all right."
Associaters were brought up by Ben Affleck and Farrellly's brothers to discuss the finalists of the Damon and Brown show.
Brown said before, "I wanted to figure out how they'd behave in the way they've handled people, regardless of who you are."
The only black character that was shot by a white man's neck.
The famous White People's publisher and film director Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio have asked for the finalists, whose duties are "in a way that we don't like."
After the debate was published, there was a social media disparity against Damon's situation.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger in writing that "he can explain the diversity of this person's speech about the one black man in Matt Damon's room as a pain in the EU."
After the tweet was sent, he got 5,000 tweets and 4,000 fans.
Damon's positions came when he was in front of the social debates in the media.
In 2014, Michael Brown was killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown, who encouraged black lives to be actively involved in the country's campaign against colored lawmakers and adults.
On Saturday, the singer Prince spoke in a silent manner about the movement when the annual albums were identified in Grammy Awards.
The albums are still important, he said.
The albums, like books and black lives, are still important.
In the near future, the leaders of the movement of the Dark must be informed that Elizabeth Hasselbeck, an important person in Fox News, should not be evaluated as a hate group.
Leaders, Black Life Important Network is a love group, he said.
In the past, Damon was informed that he was included in the list of manufacturers, manufacturers and media bosses who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the recognition of the Catholic Church in the West.
I'm not sure he didn't accept the invitation or he didn't meet with Dad.
"The American Ninja Warrior" first race race to the champion
He was a professional rock climber and was the first to win the U.S. Ninja War against Isaac Caldiero on Friday night.
This competition in the 7th season had never seen a full-fledged contender on the bridge.
At the end of the season, Caldiero and Geoff Britten were able to stay on the final tour.
The last task was to raise a 20-metre-highway in about 30 seconds.
Britten became the first to complete this race, so he was able to be the first to complete the 4th battle against the American Ninja War, but Caldiero was able to finish it three seconds ago.
After this difficult possibility, Caldiero spoke to E!News about having won a million dollars big prize.
Isaac told E! a big deal about his debt, saying, "It wasn't great to think about it, I won over $10,000 a year, or I went through it."
So I can't even imagine what it's going to be like... I don't know what to do.
The author Kent Weed de The Hollywood Reporter finally met with the reporter and explained why no reward would be paid even if the first contestant finished the British party.
Under the rules, money is given as fast as possible.
Weed said, "If anyone is more than I am, he will get the quickest reward."
Though he had a great reward, and changed his life, he too gained a great reward.
I don't think it's a bad idea about it.
He's so happy he did what he did.
He's got a lot of toners from his surprises.
A great man and a family father.
He's a hero for the kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "I'm glad it's Isaac if I'm going to be a teenager."
I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if he had changed his roles.
The American Ninja War has renewed the deal for the eighth season and the attacks will begin in Bahar in 2016.
Detroit Tigers lost Minnesota Twins
MINEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season wasn't too generous for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers, one of the best of baseball, is now taking place during the last time of the U.S. Central League.
Tigers, who sent the game down to ruin, was able to raise Minnesota Twins on the target field 5-4 a day.
The Twins lost the chance to raise the U.S. Second League in the middle of the Middle East between Houston Astros.
And for Detroit, even for one night, it was a good return to a good game that was not seen very much in the second half of the season.
Tigers' manager, Brad Asmus, says, "No matter what happens, it's all kind of weird."
Tigers' ballerman, Alfredo Simon, was able to count one in the sixth and ninth rounds of the six-and-a-half-year-olds in the first two battles of Detroit.
Simon (13-9) 6 order 3/1 shots, three of which were shot.
This was only a third-quality starter in the last nine stages.
He said, "I just want to shut you up."
It's hard for the sevens to break every game, so I wanted to get into the game too.
Victor Martinez, the chooser of Tigers, made three attacks, and the second was the first RBI to win from August.
This was the first three night of the battle that Martinez won against Seattle Mariners in the 6th century.
"It's been a long time," said Asmus.
He seemed good (in the army training) and he was already looking at the BP, and he was in the middle of the game.
At the end of the seventh battle, Twins, who had three rights to re-enter the game, took the best chance.
The middle-class player Byron Buxton started a two-way fight on the left-hand side line.
The right-wing player Aaron Hicks could only make a slow fight, and Simon got a fight on his knees before he left BrianDozier for Blaine Hardy.
Mauer, a two-way right-wing player Drew VerHagen, was led by the only player who was able to attack Miguel Sano.
On the second round, a couple of VerHagen runners were able to pull Trevor Plouffe's third runner into the second game.
Plouffe's battle against DP was 27 times the big one this season.
After the hit for the speed to secure Detroit's dock, Mauer crossed the RBI and opened up with Tigers and approached Bruce Rondon, who made 5-4.
Along with this, he was caught in three explosions to rescue the fifth right wing.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who lost his form.
The Tigers won three times in their first two shots against the newly tested right-wing player who stayed away from the streets for over a month.
"It's not the game I want to play clearly," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable in my life, and I was able to make very good explosions in the third shoots."
Hushes took Ian Kinsler's second driver from the game when he first made a successful shot.
The right-hand player J.D. Martinez left Victor Martinez alone on the first stage of the game.
Victor Martinez fought with the racers to cross the 0-21 band in the match position.
The third runner, Nick Castellanos, was watching one shot at the right, and he won another race, but Victor Martinez was shot while he was trying to do the third, so the threats ended.
The Tigers made a second addition, and the capturer James McCann, a foreign pair and a middle player from Anthony Gose, made a double win.
The governor of the Twins said Paul Molitor, "a great fight."
He didn't shoot very good, but he fell right on the ground.
The fireman Hughes did three shots that did not bring the number to the opposite end with A.J. After.
Hughes was convicted for three and four innocents in six wars.
NOTLAR: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez has disappeared because of the pain in the attack.
In 2007, Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's brain surgery, will be interviewed.
Since August, it has been planned that Sanchez, who has been on the list for weeks, should start working on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is gone, Twins will start with LHP Daniel Norris DL.
Before David Price transfer was met in 30 Temmus, this is still in four schools with Norris and Tigers 1.1.
He hasn't been playing since August 20 on the right.
Tigers and Twins will finish their three game series on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.33 ERA).

According to an explanation published after the meeting, President Li Keqiang and senior leaders, Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
Minaytur account now too fashion-Time Journal Summary Two
The roads in the fashion world turn back and come back to the tents.
In recent times, I've seen those who've become miners...
It's possible to tell you that the little bags connected to the adults are also being taken care of.
They say everything's so small.
I think it's fair for the cashiers to take this look.
Nearly in his pockets, he couldn't walk through the windows with the windows, and he started to eat from one of them completely, and he wanted to cut them down.
There were small bags already, but this time they came up against us with the reduced conditions of their large armchairs.
Only your phone, your credit card, and your keys can touch these little bags.
My mind started with C√©line and Herm√®s, spread with Prada.
The turning into the mining interest of the county was also the new models.
Loewe, he's got the fun bags he's been preparing this season with two large cases.
Panda, the most famous of the bags in the file form and the most visible of the boxes in the box and the file format.
It looks like the sizes of the large bags, which are named after the phenomens of the luxury brands, are still the most reddish of the world.
Hermes, Jane Birkin, is one of the most favorites in the "Birkin" account ever made.
Herrsch Jane Birkin said he didn't want his name to be known by the press, but we've got a place in the memory this way.
In the weeks of fashion, it made it possible for the mini-canton ice to freeze.
In the basements, too, my bags are moving forward.
It's not possible to catch them because they're too thin.
They can be used with long-distance weapons.
But on the podiums, we've seen more of those long-distance weapons, and they're turning into models' tickets.
I mean, it's a little bit of someone who's moving on to a point.
I've got something for those who don't go to the store, but those who don't leave them.
They're friends with big bags.
How?
We're turning the mini bags into one that can connect them to big ones.
I mean, I've found this smoke coming out of the podium, and I've found it fast in the distance.
Let's see what else we'll see!
Periodic payment [P]
Turkey will fight with the world's brands on trial.
This experience that I've gained in my work makes them rich now.
Loft is one of them.
We've seen a number of black models that have already begun to take place in every season.
When the blacks grew so high, they found their closest friend.
The solid pieces and detailed designs are being developed as a personal friend of the tests.
Generally short models called "motorbike" are in my day.
The powerful air of the heart is still filled with dark parts; the long blues, the scattered sweaters, provide a bright view of the sport.
Young people used to want to lose their clothes and most of them.
He was supposed to save the day.
Now they want to carry a piece of it that's as cool as the kids are.
From this point of view, it is possible to say that Loft's collections and complete pieces of purpose are correct
Large step for small, "global" banks
The World Premier of the "The Art of Banksy" collection, which brought together Banksy's remains, was held in Istanbul.
The first thing that the author has worked for 15 years, and the first thing that comes between 85 originals, is the Global Karakoy building.
The first edition of Bansky's secret street artist opened in Istanbul on the first day of World War II.
Of course, there was no famous artist in the world who was hiding his identity and using his personal name.
And we don't know he's not coming to Istanbul.
But the surgeon said Steve Lazaridas didn't even know about it.
There is no situation that requires him to be released.
Because the way of Bansky and Lazaridas, an old friend, has been separated after 12 years.
Some of the cells that were processed were collected from Lazaridas and some from the collections.
But there are things that Bansky's followers are worried about.
What did Banksy think about the article "The Art of Banksy" that was brought to an audience of 85?
For example, how did they cope with the introduction of a ticket (35 TL)? What if he saw a small store that was built at the end of the 800-metre-gallar field?
Does the red balloon girl, the cleaning woman, sound like the world's worst things like Goul now?
It's a great shame for the Banksy followers to be brought back to life by the order of an aristocratic spirit-conspirator who hid his identity.
It's not the kind of Banksy.
But you still get the tickets in the limited number!
The great pain for the small, global world for the Banksy can be seen as far as the moon of the "The Art of Banksy."
Those are the deaf, the dumb.
If they go, they'll get a lot of shit.
President Recep Tayyyyyy and Erdoƒüan took the lead on those who signed the announcement.
He said, "Indeed, they are wrongdoers, and they are [themselves] abased."
Indeed, those who are with the wrongdoers are wrongdoers.
He said, ‚ÄúThey have done the same thing, because they have been with those who have gone astray.‚Äù
Recep Tayyyip Erdoƒüan, who succeeded in the explosion in Sultanahmet, said, "In this action in the Sultanahmet Meydani, an area known as the history and the environment, I need to share my regret with the German Government that our friend has died in this area, and I need to share it with the German Chancellor.
And I want to send my wish to the people of Germany to the families of those who have died first."
He said, "We're going to continue our fight with terrorism."
Erdoƒüan, who led his attention to the academics who signed the data, said, "I am particularly sorry for the fact that those academics who have signed the contract have failed in the face of all of this.
It doesn't make any sense who our people are much closer to, that is, in the presence of a professor, who's a traitor.
These are the people who are stingy.
Those are the wrongdoers, and they are the losers.
And they were guilty of the same sin, because they were with the hypocrites.
And where will those who are in the state of Qinar, who are with his father, leave the three-year-olds in the city, who are with him?
How do they bother to take a seat next to his killers?
I'm inviting you to take all your high school courses, university Senates, and our laws to see them for the sake of these actions.
I told you yesterday that the steps you have to take must be taken in order.
So let them go what they are going to do in it.
Those who want to make politics in Parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, they'll go to hell or go to the mountains.
I'm so open and honest.

The story of the six-year-old Amassian school student who aims to be a champion in the Middle East is marked by "Gen√ß Pelilvans" in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
The first documented young Pillivans, who chose to make this section, is one of the names of the Christmas Day award.
Despite the birth in the Netherlands, it's actually an Executive Director, Mete G√ºmurhan.
When he was a child, he listened to popular stories from Turkey, where he came in writing. He watched the passengers.
"There's only political issues in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anadolu.
"For example, how sad it's that Dad doesn't know much about our sports." He wants to come up with six managers and prepare a documentary project.
This project will not work, but one day it will open the logbook to G√ºmurhan to another project door.
'We're stuck in the sugar factory'
In the meantime, Mete G√ºm√ºrhan, who is from 10 to 11 years of age, will go to Samsun, whose family lives.
The children's father won't let them be taken for evidence.
Maybe he's talking about how he's experiencing this violence, saying, "I thought about what I could do all day.
'Cause it could have been backed back from the Cultural Revolution.'
Dad was talking about a bed school in Amasia where the kids were going.
I thought I'd go there.
I met 26 kids at school who were interested in sex at school.
In a week, we started with their preparations, and we ended up with their permission.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We slept in the kitchen of the sugar factory."
It's been the most difficult language in three weeks to manage the complete document.
"I didn't know what I was going to face when I drew up."
"They didn't know Turkish," he says.
Young Pellyvans, 26 children's story is focused on the bottom of the story.
Baran, who was raised by his uncle and lived in his kilograms, Harun, who didn't join the coaches because he broke his arm, Beitullah, the school's favorite child, Ummit, the youngest champion Ahmet and the group...
Mete G√ºmurhan says he's working with the kids, "I've completely left them."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I've been in the first shower for the first week of training.
I wanted the kids to act like they didn't have a camera.
"No matter how fast they've been."
It was a surprise to be chosen to Berlin
Mete G√ºm√∂rhan, who said that the young students didn't expect to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival, said, "We were ready, but we were surprised to be elected to Berlin."
Young Pellyvans aren't a sport, but I'm doing something that's out of their lives to talk about kids' struggles.
He says, "I wanted to plan ahead for the children who had family problems to find out who they were and what they could do with their problems."
Support for academics from the Sanat world
Following the announcement of the "Committee Academy" initiative, a survey of today's academics will be opened and they will come to the same side to explain their support.

"We are with the academics who have been appointed to the Lin√ß campaign."
The Inter-Agency Academy, the Initiative, 11 October, and the joint statements made in Ankara and Istanbul on behalf of the government, published a main announcement, "We are not sharing this case".

But most of the young people who miss the heart of the cancer after the canal of a psychologist say, "I'm going to give the child back to the family or the environment, when there's no names to represent at the point of good behavior."
Not always good examples.
"And, son, he's copying the injustices."
When we're talking about how we're going to get close to them, Demir starts by remembering that the syndrome is seen in greater severity.

Suzman Psychologist Demir reminds us of the duties he has to perform in order to break the symmetry of worship:
Know his emotional pain, make sure you're calm before he gets in trouble.
Don't ever let him print your feelings.
You said you'd respect her beauty to promote independence.
Set a good example in teaching, using the names that will be a role model for him.
Try to take the place of our ancestors in our daily lives together.
It will be helpful to read together the books of the righteous and understand the real world.
Change your communication style to the adults you grew up in.
Don't forget that addiction and motivation used the same ways in the brain.
Share with your child the opportunity to change mistakes, and accept it as it is.
Well, I'm sure you'll have the scientific support.
It's amazing what's going on and what's going on.
There's a need for comfort and help, except in the wake of a symmetry syndrome.
Unfailing love, actually calling for help.
But I'm sorry that's not how it is.
Above all, this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to limit borders or ties.
Dr. Recai Jayao, who's paying attention to certain names on television in every country.
The syndrome shows itself more closely in connection with these celebrations: "They're all gone."
Most of them have no choice.
As for those who possess, they will not be like them.
Or that they do not belong to me, or that they are unable to come to terms with me.
Those who do not have the means to do so will be given permission and will not be able to live as they do.
There's no difference between those who look at you or those who look at you like you.
They're both dreaming of getting drunk.
They're making money free of charge, they're on the day of the magazine.
Even knowing that's enough to raise the ghost.
Another advice from Dr. S√ºmmere Psychology Demir is to ask about the reality of those lives at this point.
You should not be distracted from the fact that life is a matter of word.
The support of the person who heard the beauty comes around here.
But the man's being rich is about to admit that he's like himself.

Dr. Fevzi is sorry, he's answering the questions in the office of the Meydan newspaper.
I have a foot in my mouth, and every morning when I wake up, I go out in the bathroom with my wife's pain after meals, two or more times a day.
Could that stop me from giving me my kilo?
I'm starting to use it right now, but I don't want to eat, I don't give a kilo.
That's what I've been through since I was a kid.
What am I supposed to do?
Do you think I'm supposed to be an operation?
CEVAP: Most of the time a infection occurs in the Safra hospital.
A sign of this woman's suffering soon after her meal is that when you eat, it is a sign that you release the sick patient and release him to the grave.
If you're in a hurry to get out of it, you're gonna get out of here.
That's why you're going out to the bathroom.
And because you're going out in a nice tub, it's gonna take you out of your food, and it's easy to give you a kilo.
I think you need to fix this situation.
If you go to a gestro enterologist and find out what I'm saying, you can get rid of this with antibiotics.
But in the end, you may also need to have a medical operation.
The underlying probiology may reduce your complaints a little, but it won't.
I'm telling you, whatever you're doing, I'll keep using the probabilities.
Because it's the biggest help for your failure. It's the probiotic dust.
I'm eating a lot of food when I'm stressed.
I give myself food when I'm stressed and tired, and I take kilos.
How can I handle this?
CEVAP: The demand for food means that the energy needs are not really met.
Maybe it's because it's a little bit of food, or it's gonna throw them in the morning and lunch.
Another reason is that you can't control the bones you eat.
That's why your nervous system needs to work well.
If you have an ulcer, a respiratory disease, or a similar problem, or if you are using a probiotic medicine, it's the easiest way.
You'll see more.
I can't wait, the doctors don't know why.
You have information that is generally due to weakness.
It's all very reasonable for me, but my situation is a little different.
I don't have a kind of kilo.
I don't know why it's important.
He doesn't say anything to the doctors.
CEVAP: The techniques we apply are not just a failure to achieve physical work of the body, but to return to ideal sizes.
Disagreements are the same kinds of disappointments.
It's the same technique that can't get the weight of the weight of the weight that you don't get the weight of the weight of the weight.
And you're getting weaker when you eat the sweet and cold stuff.
I think you've understood that so far.
You too can be warned by a carbon point and you can take kilograms without a healthy release.
I mean, you're getting away from your ideal body.
Our other patients have also gone away from their ideal bodies.
You will reach your ideal body by weight, and they will reach it by weight.
If the system gets out of hand, you get kilograms, and they give kilograms.
But first of all, the system needs to work properly.

Makes the child feel worthless
There are some emotions that have been born in a world of human emotions.
Fear, sorrow, joy, surprise, despair, anxiety...
But hatred, hatred, and feelings like intuition come into play in children, and some of the wrong impressions.
Everyone needs to know how to be a child again.
So you respect the decisions of the family or of the social environment, you want to ask yourself, and you want to feel that it is worth it.
Its healing is the result of a healthy person‚Äôs being made.
For example, in matters that concern the child, such as the child‚Äôs choice of dress and grooming, does not matter to the child‚Äôs wishes, nor does the child‚Äôs own rights (to be sent to the child‚Äôs training course) are respected by the child‚Äôs personality.
A child who is not respected for his or her identity and his own lack of self-esteem, the defense mechanism has created a sense of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because, in fact, it's quite different from being angry and hate," says psychologist Hilal Arslan, "the child doesn't accept what is done to himself, he's worth it, and he's trying to tell himself and his environment.
This is how a child's behavior is not accepted, and that's how he's developing his personality, and that's what the psychologist says, "The hatred here means 'I have', and it serves to protect the child's self-esteem."
He says, "If you're allowed to be a child, you're out of the midst of hatred."
A child tries to protect his own identity by avoiding it and avoiding it.
Arslan, who says that in a small age, and in the most vulnerable, the spirit and the most vulnerable time of life, children will experience the feeling of being left out in the presence of their parents, the environment, and the emotional and emotional violence of their children.
Arslan goes on to say: "This may sometimes be the way you don't meet your needs in a sense of emotional meaning (don't touch them, don't touch them, school or other needs), and sometimes you don't meet your physical needs (e.g. food, drink, shelter, school needs, etc.)."
It's a development that opens the door to hate.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are such acts as humiliation, contempt, humiliation, persecution, unnecessary and severe punishment, feelings of worthlessness and haughtiness.
These behaviors are deeply rooted in a child‚Äôs personality.
"The child, or the child, will lose the respect he feels for himself, and he will spend his life in a way that is neither worthy nor worthy of his love nor inadequate, or he will try to protect his own identity by avoiding anger and hatred."
