Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that "they look like monkeys"
A part of the members of the Assembly were cut off from the proposal to be amended to "CUP" (members of the Irish Parliament).
This proposal is prompted by plans to change the name of the House of Wales.
Members of the whole political spectrum are worried that this could be a cause of laughter.
One of the librarians said his group was upset because the new name was "Rome with Tup and Vdlub."
For readers outside Wells: This is definitely an attempt to do it on the streets.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The representative of the Green Conservative Party pointed out that his group "is not convinced" to change the name, but notes that the new name CVP (in English – MWP) has a certain vocabulary with a "mupet".
In this context, note W is similar to the English Yorkshire production of U.S.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the draft legislation by amending its name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision on all the descriptive names referred to by the members of the Assembly will belong to the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public inquiry on the proposals, which set out a broad support to the Assembly to start calling the House of Wales.
As far as its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "Members of the House of Wales, a short "CPU", but the "CUP" option has received the greatest support after a public inquiry.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will appear to be a capital for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft amendment to a few weeks.
The reformist bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of its members as well as the Commission's own design.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they come to discuss the draft legislation.
Macedonians will vote at a referendum to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to allow for an ongoing ten-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbour represents a claim to the Greek State territory, and has repeatedly expressed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is an opposition to the referendum on the change in the name of the country, has become aware that you will not read the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name of the country is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells lock on the background of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today and both have disappeared."
Adams shared that the destruction of the bars is understandable.
"Hors today socialize in various ways," he adds.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhoods every day, where everyone gathers regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be in the same position.”
The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people who do not help save the rest of the shrines.
"The vast majority of the people who buy dwellings in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, since it is not particularly likely that most new inhabitants will visit them."
Both churches were built by white sands, before Harlem was converted into a black township – the Metropolis community in 1870, and St. Martin, a decade later.
The original white methodist plague occurred in the years following 1930.
After that, the building became owned by the blacksmiths of the apartment.
"St. Martin" was a poet of black Christians under the leadership of the famous John Howard Johnson, who organized the fight against the merchants of the 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black people.
In 1939 the building suffered severe fires, but Father Johnson’s enormities formed a plan for her restoration, where the camps were ordered.
Similar David Johnson, the son of the father of Johnson and the successor of St. Martin, pridefully calling them "the poor camps."
The expert who used the camps in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical tool".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first system of bells in the world used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriuder says that from St. Martin they haven't replaced him.
What was played in St. Martin over the past few weeks was a complex story, driven by architects and performers, some brought by world church leaders, and others by Episcopal Episcopal Episcopals.
From the newspaper – which is the leading authority of the passion, consisting of world leaders – they wrote to the Eparhia in July, expressing their concerns that the Eparhia would “be willing to transfer the costs of the press” even though it did not play a role in the recruitment of architects and executives sent by the Eparhia.
Some genoriasis have complained of lack of transparency by the Eparhia.
A 13-year-old child is injured by a shark in a horse hunt in California
Akula attacked and wounded 13-year-old boy last Saturday while it was a nightmare in California on the first day of the hunting season, the representative bodies reported.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. in the vicinity of Biekan's beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamle shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been messing with friends about half an hour in the morning when he had the boy screamed for help and he was allowed in with the whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamle first thought that the child had caught a smile and was excited, and then he realized how he would cry: “Aha!
I'm caught!"
Hamle shared that when he got to the boy, he realized that the whole area of his key was broken.
"I called everybody out of the water, because there's a shark!" added Hamul.
The boy was transported with helicopter to the Children's Hospital "Rady" in San Diego, where he was treated critically.
It's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Jills has produced a media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water had been noticed by an eagle, but it is estimated that it is not of a dangerous species.
Jills adds that the victim has caused trauma on the upper part of his body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the coastal line from the Panto beach in Kazablad to Finland in Enstinas for 48 hours from security considerations while the investigation was under way.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not pose a threat to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offset of the Great Britain market for beautiful products
Sainsbury is opposed to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening stations for wonderful products in their facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant deficit on the market for beautiful products in Britain, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products decrease, the largest auctions for beautiful products will be available in 11 stores throughout the country, after which, in the success of the initiative, such items will be found in other objects.
The investment in the beautiful industry is done at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space released on chairs, recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of wonderful products offered up to 3000 products, and for the first time they included brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space like the suggestions in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-emerges its botique range of vegetables, so most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop will try programs for discounts in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will be opened in Seli Ouk, Birmingam later this year.
Online and misleading marketing focuses on the marketing of smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times, leading to the need for more efforts by supermarkets to attract buyers.
Mike Kapp, chief executive director of Sainsbury, has shared that the objects will look more like universal stores, while the top brands are trying to cross the Aldi and Lidl disconcerts, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury, Argos has hundreds of stores, as well as Habits has opened, since they bought both doors two years ago – for which the company claims it has increased the sales of food goods and made the acquisitions even more expensive.
The previous experience of the verga supermarkets to prefascinate their objects for beautiful and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experiment with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the company ended up after a dispute about the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's properties in the supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed, after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio's property owned by Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim Lloyds will play a role in the plan, ensuring the rich range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: "We have transformed the nature and nature of our wonderful stands to improve the overall survival of our customers.
We also invested in special training for our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the site.
The presentation of us brands aims to respond to any taste and all necessary in a pleasant setting, as this combination turns us into attractive destinations for wonderful products, which leads to the very old way of marketing."
Peter Jones "bensen" after Holly Willowby's refusal of a deal for 11 million pounds
Dragons De Peter Jones' star "has risen," after TV leader Holly Willowby refused to trade 11 million pounds with his elevator company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for the brand of domestic devices and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to Goop's brand of Guinnet Poltrou.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced his departure to Instagram.
Holly Willowby left the stars of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to kipi", after being removed from their income business with the brand of lifstal products in the last minute – with a view to focusing on its new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones "has become angry" when the "gold girl" of television admitted during a press meeting on Tuesday at the center of his business empire in Marlow, Bukingashher, that its new contracts – at a value of 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will be no more time for his brand of domestic products and accessories Truly.
The business was attracted to Goop's Goop brand by Guinnet Poltrou, as the audience said it doubled the wealth of Wilwby, whose value is predicted at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Wiluby announced his leaving Truly in Instagram, Jones left Britain with a plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One source shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave things totally unpredictable.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
In the capital of Marlow there is a warehouse that is full of waiting products for sale."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leadership of "This morning", which is one of the most successful stars in Britain, could cost millions of companies due to large investment in products ranging from capital and clergy to clothing and household products, as well as could lead to a fun in the launch of the market market market.
And not in the last place, it can also mean a long friendship.
Willowby, who has been the mother of three children, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Kap, for ten years.
The same Wiluby founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who is 52, joined the company's president in March.
Two families often go to parties together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television producer company.
Willowby will become a "post" of the brand for M&S and will also replace An McParlin as the lead of the transfer "I am significant" on ITV.
The source, who is close to Jones, made the following statement last night: "We won't comment on his business."
Severe negotiations leading to “relationship”
It is concerned about the criticisms that it would bring from the press channels for the launch of a comment that someone would consider "not appropriate for the president" and too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump answered in his joke "newary" way.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as “a major step towards removing North Korea's nuclear weapon”.
But negotiations to remove this weapon are in progress.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's diplomat Ri-Yung Ho reported to the representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal relationship" from the United States to the first steps of its country on the road to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were on our way to war on this side.
They were going to kill millions of people.
Instead, we now enjoy wonderful relationships."
The president said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – ending tests with rockets, releasing prisoners and returning to the body of American military personnel.
He also protected his inortodoxal approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to keep as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there who are trying to get into this precipitated zone, we would have about 200 people right there," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia leave the island and lead to hundreds of deaths.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, there was no national disaster that was required to initiate international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unambiguous opinion that international assistance is not needed, which makes things very easily challenging," said Mrs. Sumbong.
While "Save the Children" is a team to go to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the country's territory.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to recovery efforts.
In view of the continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still not prepared for such natural disasters.
Although refugees were built in Ache in the case of tsunamis, they were not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of warning siren for tsunamis in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between many Indonesian islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make this logic even more difficult.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, the hospital ship has sent to Palu, but they will be at least three days before he can reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of the remaining infrastructure of Indonesia in the centre of his campaign, investing a large number of resources in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds keeps his office under constant stress as Joe opens up the urine again the next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure, born of continuing sectarian pressure in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought along the streets with swords, clubs, and arrows as well as other early weapons.
See: Daniel Sturge brought late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing in the High League against Chelsea in the 89th minute this Saturday at St.ford Bridge in London.
Sturge received a delivery from Jordan Shakyri at about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot and then sent a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The top moves over the penal field and points to the top right corner of the network.
She's moved to the placard of Cape Aresabalag, and we're on the wrong side of the network.
"I tried to take a good position to control the ball because players like Shak are always looking for pre-positions, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," said Starj in front of LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen Kante surrendering, beating my ball, and I've just shot without much to think about."
Chelsea took from 1 to 0 in the 25th minute after the head of his Babylonian star, Eden Asar.
The attacker of the "sins" gave five to Mateo Kovacic, after which he printed from the middle of the field to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacič has changed the center's double-entry fast.
Then I left a quick shot of a gun that brought Ahaz to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar chased the defenders and noticed a left foot in the far corner near Liverpool's backyard, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will rise against Napoli in the Champagne League group stage at 15:00 this afternoon at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
The next opponent of Chelsea will be Videoton in the League of WEEFA's League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia grew to 832
The number of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia grew at 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were caught in a trap in the ruins of the buildings, followed by the earthquake with a magnitude 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves of up to 20 feet, reports the news conference to the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Paulu with more than 380,000 people is inhabited with broken stone walls built.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was tortured to death.
It's started a murder investigation, after the woman's body was discovered this morning in Birkenhead.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 in the morning with injuries from the Grayson Moust of John Street's arrest, suspected of being a 32-year-old man.
The police pray to help everyone in the area who saw or heard nothing.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I am asking all those who were close to John Street in Brkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious about us.
Also, I pray that all, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken over something with the cameras on their table, contact us, as they can have vital information on the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was discovered was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived at the scene and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, as the police reported that the victim's relatives are now informed.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Miuz tried to get back to his apartment, but he was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man remained silent when he realized what had happened.
The residents are told they're going to spend hours until they're allowed to come back.
One of the police officers reported to the man that the whole area was treated as a crime.
There's a crying woman on the spot.
She continues to repeat "that's so terrible."
Two police vans passed through the corridor on Tuesday, while the other van remained outside.
There are police in the corridor watching the residential block.

Cromwell's parliamentary status is transformed into the latest memorial hit by "recording history"
Its prohibition will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that have been executed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
Mr. Crick's proposal was described as "noble" and "recording history".
John Goldsmith, president of the "Cromoel Community", said: "We were not going to this debate to remove the statue of Oliver Cromwell until the castle of Westminster was turned into a target.
The iconography of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be victimized because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The great presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornnikrovt is evidence of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cremoel is considered by many, perhaps even more than 19 centuries ago than today, to be a defence of Parliament against external pressure, of course, in his case this is monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of an endless historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person, which represents a part of the growing division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve recognition and respect."
Prasse killer wounded a mortal Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by market dust in southern China, reports local media.
The man, identified only by his family like Yuan, was found dead with the interrupting artery and covered in blood near the market corner of Lippanshui in the province of Guayjou, reported on Sunday in South China Morning Post.
The Swedish people have been preparing to inject their vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Sinin of the province of China, China.
It is assumed that he arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 market bags.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also shut the door to his neighbor's kitchen open.
He also reported that in the kitchen there was a big man's pores with a bloody flower.
The medical expertise confirmed that the 550-found dust attacked a deadly farmer, reports the report.
"My brother's feet were bloodied and confused," said Uncle Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The record of a security camera shows how Yuan went to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his purse.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The killer was not belonging to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader informed Evening News that the press was closed so that he could not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan's family and market leadership are negotiating a death penalty.
Even though they're rare, and they've been reported for the pigs that attack people.
In 2016 the village attacked her wife and her husband at their farm in Masachuzets, after the man was attacked with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, the 650-pound pig caught an egg farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him.
After an orange farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can be seen as a "spute".
"They're just playing.
The monsters are like little kids, extremely selfish... they don't intend to hurt anyone.
But a man must also deal with them with respect," the man concludes.
The weighting hurricane Rosa will bring honor and river rain to the southern part of the United States
According to the weather forecast, the hurricane Rose is losing weight as it moves over the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring to the waters of flood in northern Mexico and the southern parts of the United States.
Rosa includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a hurricane of category 1, counted at 5 hours in the morning east time and is located at 385 miles south-west of Punta Evgania, Mexico.
It is expected that on Sunday Rosa will move north.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, it begins to form a synchronous, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the island of Baha California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to emit the tropical oil deep in the north to the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some regions of Mexico.
In the next few days, the tropical season together with the nearby syndrome will cause frequent heavy rains in the south-west.
At the local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, bring out the waste streams and possibly allotments in the desert.
The deep tropic effect will lead to drops from 2 to 3 hours an hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the south-west are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible to have light water in rapid worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It'll be extremely unpleasant to travel a hat in the desert when there's a fear of tropical rain.
The heavy rain can turn cannons into stormy rivers, and the hormonal storms will bring up dust and dry winds.
The approaching syndrome will lead to heavy rains in some parts of southern California.
It is possible to reach a passage from over half an inch, which will lead to the carrying of a short drop of streams and smooth roads.
It's gonna be the first wave for the winter season.
In the late week and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying their tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the Four angles on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, it can bring great temperatures in the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the short distance temperature.
There is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Misuri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moin, Ayova.
In the next few days, the remaining summer summer will try to increase and expand.
In most of the central and eastern United States it is expected to have a warm beginning in October, as from the south-east to the north-east, it is expected to rule temperatures about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach up to 80 degrees per Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast of time indicates a high probability of temperatures over the middle of the US east in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanau's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday by six television networks the impressive rise in the testimony of the nominations of Supreme Court Bret Kavanau and Christine Blaysy Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s in the 20th century.
At that time political opposition continued as the networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last minute of Friday: an agreement concluded by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleek and the FBI had to conduct a one-week investigation on charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Commission that she was convinced by 100% that Kavanau had pushed her drunk and tried to wash her clothes during a gymnasium.
Kavanau, in his absence of emotion witness, is absolutely categorical that such a thing has not happened.
It's probably even more than Nielsen reported a 20.4 million viewers to watch the witness on Friday.
The company has counted the average views of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no directly available data for other networks that were spreading the hearing, i.e. PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also experiencing the difficulties of measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
By comparison, we're talking about a audience like that of this champion football game or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanau's appointment, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the afternoon hearing, reports Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to the report by Nielsen CBS, there were 3.1 million, 2.14 million, MSNBC - 2.89 million and CNN - 2.52 million.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Fleke was the central figure in the fifth drama.
After the measured Republican office announced that it would vote in support of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras stopped on Friday as protestors were trying to capture an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During the entire storm for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, which was released alive by CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power, while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flyk said that he had already come out of his office with a declaration and before the closing of the elevator doors, he announced that he would be further produced during the hearing of the Commission.
The cables and exhaust networks ensured a full coverage of life several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the full Senate's vote.
Ala Flyk reported that he would only do this if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against nominations in the following week, which the Democrats insist on.
Flyk was partially convinced by talks with his friend, Senator of the Democratic Party of Chris Kuuns.
After a discussion with Kuuns and several Senator Flek made a decision.
His choice was crucial, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Cavanau.
British Prime Minister May blames the "political gambling" criticisms with Bresit
Minister-President Teresa May blamed her plans to leave the European Union in "political gambling" with the future of Britain and to cover national interests in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May attended the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingam, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the first page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced her attack against her T.N. "Plan for a lady's game" for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of customs from Britain for the EU and the reverse is "completely absurd".
Wied Sims shooting: Police arrest suspects Child Simpson for the death of a LSU player
The police are under arrest for a fatal shooting on Wayd Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Child Simpson, in his 20s, was arrested and imprisoned for murder at the second level reported to the police department in Baton Rouge.
The officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, as reported by the police that Sims lost his glasses during the war.
The police have discovered the sights of the place and they have also discovered Simpson's DNA, reported by CBS WAFB's branch.
After Simpson's investigation, the police informed him that he recognized the fatal shooting against Wade.
The guarantee is set at $350,000, notified by Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Medical Service publishes a preliminary report on Friday, in which the cause of death is a fire wound, the head and the door are affected.
The administration expressed its gratitude to the Department for the expulsion of refugees from the Louisiana State Police, the Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University police and the local residents of the investigation aid that it provided to the arrest.
LSU director Joe Aleva's athletic sport thanks to local law enforcement authorities for "modern justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot and 6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played the LSU team basketball.
In the middle of the last season, it reached 5.6 points and 2.6 players.
On Friday morning, LSU Wyade's basketball coach reported that the team was "skinat" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "this is something that worries a person all the time."
Volcano sprays peppers over Mexico City
The ashes of the volcano Popocapetel pepper reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre has warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and oil emissions have been registered over the last 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of noises and traumas.
Publicized in the social networks, photos show dark mud dust covering the front walls of cars in some of Mexico City's quarters, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, since the earthquake with Magnitude 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in close contact with Catalan separatists prior to the Year of Independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the independent protestors broke up with the genocide, when thousands joined in opposing demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarising wave of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to confuse the guards of peace with the eggs and the paint of dust, thus creating dark and sandy clouds on the streets that normally flow from tourists.
Later that day, other police came in contact with the police, and the police fled to their palaces to take control of the situation.
Over the hours, support-independence groups shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the country's declaration to preserve the country's integrity was rejected by Spain forever.
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, 40 people received medical assistance for drug abuse.
The pressure remains high in the desired independence region even a year after the holding of the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but rejected by the separatist-oriented Catholics.
The vast majority voted in favour of independence, even though the activity was low, since most opponents of the withdrawal voted against a referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the conduct of the noise in the voting sections in the region with a number of explosives.
Necessary groups spent the fifth night on the street in order to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it was forced to move on a different route.
Narciss Termes of 68, an electrician, joined the separatist protest with his wife, says that she no longer hopes for the chances of Catalunia to get independence.
"The past year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out for joy when they could vote, but now we're in a stand," added the man.
Despite the marked important victory, this was different from the regional elections in the last December, which supported the independence of Catalan political parties experienced difficulties this year, since many of their most prominent leaders are either in self-determination or are arrested in the process for their role in organizing a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pyug, a 42-year-old mechanic who wrote on his phone a protest in support of the police, claims that the conflict was caused by politicians and both sides.
His comment is that "it's been more intense."
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders awaiting a preliminary process last year, announced that they would apply for the European Parliament's elections next year.
He claims that "my candidate for European elections is the best way to resist the regression of democratic values and the repressions we observe by the Spanish government."
Londoners: Arrested men after the car broke into the house
Three men of age, 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested, after a couple of times she died at home in London.
The incident took place in the Ballynagard Crescent Thursday about 19:30 a.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blings said there's been damages on both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible for the car to be shot with the arrow.
Manga's goal is to win Livingston with 1-0 over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's First Ball for Livingstone Assured Victory
The novel in the High League Livingstone surprised Reingers and brought Stephen Gerard's second loss in his first 18th match as the manager of the "Aebrus" club.
Dolly Menga's head has become decisive, and Gary Holt's team is ranked on the second point in the Hibernian classification.
Gerard's team remains unconquered on foreign territory in the High League during this season, and the next week it's against leader Harts, from which there are eight points in the classification.
But before that, Rangers was home to Rapid Vienna in Liga Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has already been in a series of six games with no loss at first, and manager Holt hasn't felt the taste of loss since he changed his position to Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a good chance against the homeless
Holt's team had to lead the result far before he noticed naked, and his direct game style was extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his attack came up after Alan Litgou shot at the building, after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head on it.
The housekeepers left Rangers to play the ball, knowing they could seriously trouble the guests from the stats.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingstone played well, as Declan Galler and Robinson combined and reported Menga, who led the ball and pointed out the middle of the criminal field.
By this time, Rangers had managed the ball more, but they had failed to protect the homekeepers, and the returner Liam Kelly had rarely had to get involved.
This style of the game continued during the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to do rescue.
Reingers' return saved Scott Pittman's foot shot, and Little's head hit the door after another static situation for Livingstone.
In Livingstone’s penal field, the centres were easily cleared, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for the roof – first after the unity between Halket and the Glen Medalton Reserve, and then with doubts about the game with his hand.
"Fenomental" from Livingston – analysis
Alsadair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a fine game and a great result for Livingston.
The team is just playing in the past, continuing to overcome expectations and improve its presentation.
The style of the game and the composition were almost unchanged after the election was returned to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of thanks for the way he changed the election after his appointment.
He's got real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halket was incredible, organizing protection in a way that went beyond, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warl under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under the direction of Gerard, they show you some wonderful things, but in the case they were very under those standards.
They missed the last dog before the meal, just once they managed to break home protection – this loss must wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the classing.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Khaln.
On Saturday (September 29th) we became witnesses to smiles and smiles when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cold because of human rights problems, the freedom of the media and the acceptance of Turkey into the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Keller to find a huge new Jamaica.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish people living outside Turkey.
From security considerations, the police prevented a 25-year-old crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but however, many supporters who wanted to see their president ran around.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of which the Kurds also raised a vote, condemning both Erdogan's own policy and the German government's decision to allow it in the country.
The various protests reflect the reason caused by a visitor who is accepted as a hero by some German Turks and is at the same time despised as the defeat of others.

Long Latrine Prison: Six Watchers are wounded in battle · Global Voices
Six prison guards were injured in a man's high-security prison, reported by the Prison Service.
The bullet broke out in Long Latin prison in Worchester near 09:30 a.m. British time per week and still continues.
In order to manage it, special staff from the "Tordano" team were called, which would have to deal with eight persons deprived of their freedom, as the only place in the border to a prison wing.
The injured supervisors have brought medical injuries on the person and have received medical assistance at the site.
The prisoner’s spokesman made the following statement: “Specially trained staff are required to deal with the incident in Long Latrine prison.
Six overseers received medical assistance.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it absolutely clear that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, as it is possible that their sentences will be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Latrine prison, some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that after the arrest of a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated at the hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the fighting parties were invited to prison, where they were subjected to heavy beatings in which the staff was attacked by bulldozers.
The Rosa is threatened with a bright flood of Finix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the frozen areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great likelihood that this will happen soon the next week, while the weighting hurricane Rosa is carrying through the desert of the South West, leading to its risk of global floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already set up positions against the lights of Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, South California and Uta, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finnish on Tuesday, as she can bring rain on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Finnix observed in Twitter that “only ten tropical cycles have been maintained in terms of 200 miles [200 km] of Finix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border."
The latest models from the National Centre for Urages provide 2 to 4 inches of water with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Scalist mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, as in separate places up to 4 inches of rainfall.
For those who are not intimidated by the global floods, the challenge of the Rose rain can actually be a blessing, as the region is seriously affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious, some of the rain is likely to be useful, since the southwestern part is currently dry.
According to the Commission for the monitoring of the dry periods in the United States, less than 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive dryness, which is the second by weight of the category," they report from weather.com.
First, the route of Uragana Rosa leads to the drying of the semiarid Baha California in Mexico.
Rosa, who can still be praised in the morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located at 385 miles from Punta Evgania, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters over the Pacific and this is why it's losing weight.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the dry in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain above part of Mexico can be strong and can lead to a significant risk of overcrowding.
"Summer rains are expected from 6 inches from Baha California to the north-west Sonora, as possible to 10 inches", reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border tomorrow morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Yuta until Tuesday evening.
"The main risk of Rose or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern United States," they warn from the National Centre for hurricanes.
These rainwaters are expected to lead to life-threatening global floods and bringing different streams into the deserts as well as the snowflakes in the mountains.
Attack in Midsmer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old child was found with injuries from detection in Samersett.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamor Norton about 04:00 in the morning British time on Saturday.
It happened at a hospital where his condition remains "stable."
At night in the Radstock area, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man reported to the police in Avan and Samersett.
The police are asking everyone who can figure out what happened to them to connect.
Trump says Kavanau "has suffered from subsistency and anger" at the democratic party
"Every vote on Judge Kavanau is a voice that rejects the covert and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," said the Trump of Mitting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanau was "lost by the subterfuge and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kawanaou witnessed to Congress on Thursday, categorically dismissing Christine Blaysy Ford's accusation of sexual assault decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnesses during the hearing of the charges.
The president made a statement on Saturday that "the American people today have become witness to the intelligence, training and qualities" of Cavanau.
"Every vote in support of Judge Kavanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true jurist with a wonderful reputation in public service," said the president before the meeting a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president directly visited Kavanau's nomination while he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Even if I'm not a candidate, I'm actually also involved," said Trump.
"That's why I'm used to it and I'm fighting in support of the good candidates."
Trump noted that the democracies set themselves up for the mission "to stop and oppose."
It is expected that the first key procedure in the Kavanau Senate for nomination will be conducted no later than Friday, as reported to CNN one of the officials of the High Representative of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken away from the border by giant waves, when powerful earthquakes and tsunamis struck the Indonesian island of Solavesi, informing the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at the celebration the coast was moved by waves with a height of up to six feet (18 feet), brought many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunami rose after a 7.5-magnitude quake.
"When the threat of tsunamis rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, because many were victims of the disaster," said in a briefing at Jackarta Sutopo First Nugroho, the spokesman of the Agency for the Prevention of the Disasters of Indonesia BNPB.
"The water had taken its own car, the trees, all the houses, destroyed everything along its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the coast.
"Some people fell on the trees and thus managed to escape from the water," he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the Disasters Agency, photos from the air have shown many destroyed buildings and stores, collected and destroyed bridges, as well as surrounded by water jamia.
The second storm continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a declaration that the energy released from the fifth massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the dropped on Hiroshima atom bomb during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of the long and long river, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the taxes as "great" and specifies that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the buildings, added the speaker, after which he claimed that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that victims and victims could be higher across 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is located near the epicenter of the tube.
He also added that "communications are completely blocked and there is no information from Donggala".
The red cross on its side indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that his teams and volunteers have already traveled to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can be even more satisfying."
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday that it did not inform the injured Paula Tunamis, even though the officials explained that the wolves had arrived during the announcement.
Social networks have shown a man on the top floor of the building who screams at people on the street panic warnings about the nearby tsunamis.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall falls into the coast and acts as if it were a building.
Reuters has failed to achieve the authenticity of the clip at any time.
The earthquake and tsunamis have brought a severe cut in the power supply, which is opposed to the communications around Paul and so difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities notified by the responsible authorities, but evacuated still desperately need food and other products from first need.
The city airport was reopened only for the rescue operations efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali during the week.
The people who died in the Indonesian tsunami are now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala were able to safely reach Palu, where they found refuge in the fireplaces in their office halls, they went through a number of detonation scenes, says Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the initial work on rescue and recovery operations, some complain that the rich experience in such situations foreign rescuers are unable to reach Palau.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the financing, sending of staff and supplies from abroad may begin only if the site is declared as a zone of national disaster.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"Buddness is still at a regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government has announced that it is a matter of national disaster, we can accept international assistance, but from there they have not yet declared such a status."
As Paul fell the second night after the fifth earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unconscious continue to look forward to a miracle and that their close ties have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
The rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subbandno, the trainer of Indonesia's national parapelanism team, has trained two of the missing paraplenics for the Asian primacy that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the Captains in the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandida added.
"As an adult in the field of parallelism, I carry my own emotional goods," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the hotel "Roa-Roa" arrived the community on parallanerism, he was hoping to send messages on WhatsApp to the trainers in Palu who participated in a beach festival.
However, instead of five sons' notes, the only answer to his messages was one-to-one.
"I think this means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
The thieves owe $26,750 to a bank account in Newport of Levy
On Friday morning, the thefts amounted to $26,750 from Brink's employee, who borrowed a banknote in Newport, Levy, became clear from the police administration in Newport.
The driver of the car opened the bank in the news complex and prepared to charge it with money, wrote Detective Dennis Macarty in the message.
While the man was busy, another man "came running behind the back of Brink's servant" and stole the bag with money.
The Witnesses noted many suspects fleeing the scene, continuing the message, but the police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
All who have information on the identity of the suspects must contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kania West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanya West changed her name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “Man, officially known as Canyon West. ”
West, in 41 C.E., for a time, wears a pair of YE and uses it as a title for his eight albums, which was published in June.
The change interferes with his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He changes the song by Ariana Grande in the show, which is rejected for “because of emotional reasons,” he tells us about the show’s creator.
In addition to reducing his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most frequently used word in the Bible, where it means "you" or "you", divided West earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with the leading Big Boy.
"That's how I am you, I am us, it's us.
It passes from Canyon, which means only one man, to Him – which is an expression of good in us, evil, corruption, and everything.
The album is more reflective of our nature."
The rapper is one of the many known in his area who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames, including Puff Daddy, P.D. or Didi, but this year he announced his preference to the pseudonyms L. and Brother L. L.
One of West's former employees, Jay Zy, has also been presented in a variant with or without wires and/or main letters in his pocket.
Mexico's President is sworn not to use the army against civilians
New-elect Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador concluded that he would never use a military force, as the country nears 50 years of bloody repression against the students.
On Saturday, Tlatelko Plaza President Lopes Obrador promised "never use the army to force the Mexican people."
The soldiers launched a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people, while left-wing student movements were gradually spreading between Latin America.
Lopes Abraador has promised to support young Mexicans by ensuring monthly scholarships for students and finding more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States must double its financing for the development of IE
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front of the development of artificial intelligence, the United States has to double its research budget in this area, says the researcher and developer of II Kay-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was sent, after various calls from the U.S. government made statements on the subject of I.I., although the United States does not fully have an I.I. strategy.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 from innovation in II to 2030.
"The duplication of the II development budget will be a good start, since all other countries are far away from the United States and are going to make further damages to II," he said.
The double funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the II area to come from the United States, as Lee informs CBC during the past week.
Lee, whose book "I's Superpowers: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive director of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest IO companies in China – Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Melan Lee University, he worked on the IE system that won the most successful American clothing player, then a executive director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese clone of Google.
Lee grants the debt of previous federal technological events, such as the Agency's workshop on advanced defence research projects, and asks when it will be the next one that will be of help to identify new viewers.
"Researchers in the United States often have to work well to win government funding," Liy pointed out.
"China's not taking academic leaders, but the corporations," said the man.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technological companies have acquired university lights to work on IE.
Lee further claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its IE programme.
"I think that scientists on IE should automatically offer green maps," the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop an artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people from academic institutions like the way the National Scientific Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explains Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence has established a Joint Centre for Cultural Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and academic environments, and from the White House, they announced the formation of a Special Committee on Cultural Intelligence.
Also this month DARPA reported on an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, there are currently more than $100 million in the development of II.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislative body that wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Cultural Intelligence has not noticed any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this week whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This is a step that would allow for the further decades of conflict with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbour is a claim against its territorial integrity, which requires its involvement in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he himself would not vote in the referendum, while the campaign on combating him has given him a chance to doubt whether the referendum will be able to achieve the minimum 50 per cent, which are required to acknowledge his validity.
The issue of the budgets is as follows: "Are you strengthening NATO and EU membership through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in the name, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the structure after the collapse of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the framework of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivier Georgievska, 79-year-old citizens of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of Parliament have concluded that they will comply with the result of it to such a extent that it already has a decisive burden.
To change the name of the country, two thirds of parliamentarians must vote for it.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters visited the urns.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Giosse Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son, Dushko, voted at a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country, which will open the road to joining NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and set up tables in front of the palaces, which were set up by the boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads, not through the service return," Kavardarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European Union."
Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would lead to the necessary investments in Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said, after leaving his own vote.
The State also stated that the positive outcome would lead to “the realization of the future of our people”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results from the study, according to which between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in a referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, part of Macedonian television Telma, reported that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they'd vote with "Yes."
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% more than one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will represent the first serious attack on the policy of the pro-west government since it won power over May last year.
Look: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire blockade of Brighton and marks the goal
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling defeated the defenses of Brighton and brought Manchester City's victory with 2-0 on the "Ethiqad Stadium" Saturday in Manchester, England.
Aguero's playing for his head in 65 minutes seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentinian Glamist was found with a dog in the middle of the field.
He's running three guards from Britton before he's hit the ball in the empty space.
After that, Aguero is surrounded by four players in green.
He ran around one of the guards, then left behind the rest of the border of the sentence field in Briton.
Then he gave it to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker with a touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who, with his right leg hit the back of Brian Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions in his legs," reported before the reporters of City Pep Guardiola's manager.
"We planned to play him about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky that I noticed a bullet right now."
But Starling was the one who ensured the initial advance of the "heavenly" in this match from the High League of England.
He's registered in 29 minutes.
In the situation of the cave Aguero, he received a deep injection in half of Briton.
He just left a left-handed dog on the flag to Liroy Sane.
Sane made progress with the ball, after he found Sterling with a dog on the far edge.
The attacker of the "heavens" managed to cut closer, just before the ball came out of the car.
Siti will meet Hofenheim in the match from the Champagne League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Chercher wants to play certain Rockies' fate
After the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no special meaning for another game of a titled starter pitch.
And yet, the ambitious Chercer is always hoping to be a titler in the week against Colorado Rockies, if the game is of importance to Rockies, who run a game before Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West class.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the "Wilds" game after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it's still not sure that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves do not fight for anything, we want to finish the season with a good match in Denver, where the public and the other team will give everything to themselves so that they can win the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss such a fight?"
Nationals have not yet declared a start-up pizzar for a week, but it is assumed that they will allow Sherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Sherzer this year, it would be the 34th of March as a starting pizzar this year, as he was training on Thursday, and he would have the normal time to rest for a week.
Washington's right-hand pizzar has a balance of 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strands in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trip collects supporters in West Virginia
The president of Kosovo pointed to the situation with his electorate for Supreme Court Bret Kavanau, while speaking about the importance of the Republican votes in the general elections.
"By November, everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
They leave five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also claim that although I am not a candidate, what I really look at is also involved, that is why I struggle with all the strengths for the right candidates," Trump said.
Next, with “All you see this horrible radical group of democracies, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to return to their power in any way, to bear witness to their integrity, to their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to go through to get into power and control, because they're only interested in power and management, but we're not going to give them."
Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves to "stop and oppose".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "wheat, poor, poor and dishonest."
The president reminded the Senate Justice Commission, referring to the Senator of the Democrats Dayan Finstein, which caused strong reflections from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the documents?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting. It's really bad coffee, maybe the worst I've ever seen."
The libers are no longer extensive.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When Momentum's activities in my local party voted to censor me, little were surprised.
In the end, I am just the last member of the parliament of the Liberians, to whom it was said that it was not a good thing to come – just because I am speaking openly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, had this attitude, since he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement during the past leaders.
In the report on the Nottingham East Congregation on Friday, it was said that "we want the congregations to include all and be useful."
In most of my eight years as a local representative of the Liberians in Parliament, the Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most congregations and promises for a "lighter and more moderate" policy has been forgotten long ago if they have been at least on the agenda.
It was even more evident that the different views were not tolerated in the Liberian party and that every opinion would be assessed on this basis if the party's leadership liked.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before I thought they shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a real commitment and take positions that I would never agree with — whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I actually say – is followed by a whole worrying tragedy on social networks, where it is called for a call, a rejection of the dead politics, a statement that I do not belong to the liberarians.
It's not just me.
In the interest of the truth, I have even brought more happiness to some of my colleagues, since my comments at least are mainly of political nature.
I can only awaken from professionalism and the targetness of these colleagues, who stand before sexist or racist perceptions every day, without fear of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such attempts have turned into the rule.
Last week Jeremy Corbin said the librarians must conquer a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer extended, as with any sign of distrust or change of the electoral rules it is becoming more and more difficult.
In the last two years, I have received much advice to follow up, not to say so much, and then “it’s going to be all right. ”
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Since I joined the libersers 32 years ago as a student, driven by the government of Tacher, which through neglect led to a literal loss of my high school, I have fought for better public services for those who need most of them – either as a local adviser or as a minister.
I've never covered my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state stops to Bresit, it will harm households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy loyally to the leader of the liberarians.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the library, or not: for me it is pride to serve you and I promise that no fear of rejection or political rejection will stop me from acting in a way that I consider best in the protection of your interests.

Er 38-17 Melrouz: The Unvictable Air has led to the classification
The two late axles may also have changed the medical final result, but there is no doubt that Er deserved to triumph in this amazing interesting match from Tennent's High League.
The team is already covering the classing, and only one of the 10 teams is without a loss to the moment.
The better protection and the better use of opportunities have become decisive in the fight that coach Peter Merche and his team can be very pleased.
"I'm happy because the other committees have tested us very seriously in the past, and we're still without a loss," observed Murchi.
Robin Cristy of Melrous said: "Glorified for Earth, they really used their rules better than us."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Climo, led Er forward in the result, but yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, free to play in the game of Urors, allowed Melrous to jump into the result, after Jason Baggott realized that it was followed by an unsuccessful additional hit.
The climate increased the front for Er from a penalty hit a little before the half-life, noting it after the salt action, and then realising and the additional hit that made the result 17-5 for Er on the holiday.
But Melrous began the second half of the good time and the horse of Patrick Anderson, followed by a successful additional attack on Baghdad, reduced the front of only five points.
It is followed by a prolonged stop in the game due to the heavy concussion of Rurid Not, which was brought to the nose, and after the refurbishment of the sword Er increased its progress after the leg of Stafford McDoual and the successful additional hit of Climo.
After that, Er Blair McFerson's active captain got a yellow card and Melrous again used their numbering advantage, showing strong pressure and realising it through Bruce Colwin, followed by a failed additional hit.
However, their hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hotchinson received a yellow card, after taking Climo without a ball, from the consecutive punishment game Macferson realized it with the help of Er's advanced offensive line.
Climo's been carrying out an additional strike, not long ago, after Kyle Rou caught the shot from David Armstrong and pulled Gregor Henry's wing on the wing for the fifth leg of the home.
The star of Still Game seems to have pointed to a new career in restaurant business.
The star of Still Game Ford Kirnan appears to have pointed to a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that it was appointed as director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular delivery, which is also a scenarioist and one of the two stars together with his longtime commander, Greg Hemfil.
The two said that the next nine seasons would be the last for the transfer, as if Kirnan was already planning his life after Creiglanging.
According to the official registers, he is the director of the Afförmorn Limited.
The actor held back from a comment, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirnan intended to be involved in Glazgou's "professional restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": The no way out of the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The seamen are constantly patrolling the ocean floor in La Paz.
The public buildings are the ocean son of a flag.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are drawn with the motto: “The sea belongs to us in the right direction.
It's our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, which does not have access to the ocean, Chile's memory of the loss of exits after a 19th-century conflict is still alive – as well as the call to swim again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now stronger than decades ago, while Bolivia is waiting for an international court judgment on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"The force is in Bolivia, everywhere it feels courage and unity, as the country expects a positive outcome," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzzilla said.
Many patients will see the execution of the international court of a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's demand and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to provide Bolivia with sovereign access to the ocean.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who was present to go to a challenged election battle next year, also placed a lot and a lot of court judgement on Monday.
"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific," Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of the court taking a decision for Bolivia's benefit is quite small, even if it is judged for its benefit, it would not change things in reality.
The UN body located in the Netherlands has no authority to take Chile's territory and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the verdict of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments indicates that the case is "not complicated", says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean has been solved by the current government of Bolivia," Zarate says.
Then he pointed out that Morales' military rhetoric was different and that Chile was a bit of a good choice.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at the moment, but it will be extremely difficult after a normal dialogue has been conducted.
Both countries do not support diplomatic missions each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be taken very quickly.
According to it on Monday, Bolivia will have “an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new age in its relationship with Chile” as well as the opportunity to “stop being in favour of 139 years of disillusionment by both countries.”
Calzella also rejected the idea that Morales – which continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the problem with access to the ocean as a "political heritage".
"The disease will never decline from its right to the Pacific exit," he added.
"The delay is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it won't continue with nuclear weapons until it can't believe in the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Young Ho says his country will never be able to access nuclear weapons first if it is not able to trust Washington.
Ri presented her speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to save the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of opposition countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be on the way to start the nuclear-free diplomacy again more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Nun from North Korea.
Ri called the "empty hope" the idea that continuing with the US sanctions and objections for a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would cause the North to fall on its knees.
Washington is not willing to agree with the declaration without Phenyan first to make a significant injury along the way of the weaponry.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that in Phenyan they are serious about their rejection of the arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion magazines in Paris reveal the last string of massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or even completely block the sunglasses, you don't need to search any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered the gamma incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which laughed at the fashion week in Paris.
A lot of non-practicing hats caused a wave in Instagram during the summer, when designers sent the eye-browsers to cut down the community of fashion.
Valentino's exciting proposal was an extravagance flight hat with a very broad perimeter that literally hit the heads of the models.
The other too large accessories included fine teeth, magic hats and even annas – so they do not have a purpose to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – at exactly the same time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips protected and reminded them of not so much for the high fashion as for Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs had a full set of snowflakes and glasses, while the other seemed like a foot-and-mouth ice cream.
If you fall under such fashion trends, you're lucky.
The fashion specialists predict that large hats will soon be sold on fashion shops near you.
The huge hats come almost immediately after "La Bomba" – a broken hat with two-foot periphery, which was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Ratikovski.
The culture towards an extremely non-practical hat, which took over social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion floor – a weak beach bag, almost as much as the wearer dressed in a bank model.
The bag of raffy with the color of the overgard Portuguese, with raffles of raffle and tied with a white skin, was attractive to all views of the article in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the week of the fashion in Paris.
The statesman Luke Armitid told F.J.: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer – after the designer made such a great impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for Eurogabarian accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic distinctions, as this continues in 2018 with another preliminary presentation of test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can produce and implement a personal education program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone we understand about him, your words will reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot read only English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
As a result of these years' trials, we see that languages are the first to have the highest success for independent schools.
Overall, 68% of the students who have studied foreign languages have achieved high A.
The data collected by 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of the students have achieved an A in Chinese, while the same assessment has 72% of the German students, 69% of the French students and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At the moment, languages as a subject of free choice from students receive the same relationship as natural-mathematic disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in and through the programmes of independent schools.
In 2014, the Commission on Employment and Working Skills of the United Kingdom conducted a study showing that, for the reasons that employers find it difficult to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language skills.
As a result, the rule of foreign languages becomes mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require foreign language control, which turns these skills into material in a globalized world.
Depending on the chosen career, if a person controls a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, after having such skills that remains for the rest of his life.
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a few human beings at a height before competition.
According to YouGov, more than 4,000 full-time citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language sufficiently well enough to be able to carry out a language as French was the only language, with the government reaching up to 2% with a 15% indicator.
That's why investment in learning languages is important for children today.
The rule of several languages, especially those of the developing economies, will ensure that children have a better chance of finding a good job.
Every school in Scotland will be different from any taught language.
A number of schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are more important for the United Kingdom in the future for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter how interested you are in having your child, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialized in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are strongly determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredible role in the future of a country, which requires this to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.

Lebron's gonna make his debate about Lakers this week in San Diego.
The waiting is almost over for the fans who are trying to see Lebron James's first match with the Los Angeles Lakes team.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton said that James will take part in the first pre-trial training team match with Danver Nogets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's gonna play in two.
"It'll be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," said Shaggo Walton via Lakers' official website.
Reporter for Lakers Mike Trudel told on Tweet that probably James will play a few minutes in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans about his sixth sword from Lakers' pre-conceived training.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need presuppose swords to prepare for the new season," he said.
Mixing of Trump in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election minutes this evening at Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Tromp's myth, which includes obstacles to famous places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By dismissing the confirmatory vote for the election of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are afraid of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
In what hour will the Trump's moment be held in West Virginia this evening, and how can you watch online?
Trip's visit to Weiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours, east time this evening on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Tromp's visit to Willing, West Virginia, down through the release of live on YouTube.
Trump will probably consider the hearings this week for the nominations of Supreme Court Bret Kavano, in which there has been tension due to allegations of immoral sexual acts that hold the Senate's confirmatory opinion up to one week while conducting an investigation by the FBI.
The main objective of this series of minutes, however, is to help the republics to gain energy for the elections in November.
So in President Donald Trump's campaign, it was announced that these five minutes the following week are aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control over Congress is of such importance to its programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and start a campaign season, filled with commitments," said Reuters spokesman of the Trump campaign, who refuses to be mentioned.
Earlier this evening, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wiiling, may bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
The second trip to Trump this month will take place on Saturday – the country that won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who stands for sociological studies.
"It is not a good sign of Morrisi that the president has come to put pressure on sociological studies," said Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Rader Cup" 2018: The US team will fight to the last time, keeping its hopes alive before the singles in the week
After three follow-up sessions without an in-house "forsom" game on Sunday afternoon, they could bring what was needed by the "Rader Cup".
The change of the advantage in sport is quite a subjective concept, in which players believe freely, even more in contradictions than this one.
So, what team is in a better position right now?
"They took six points, and now they're only four, so I guess we've got some energy," Jordan Spiet said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points at just twelve for distribution.
As Spit says, however, Americans still have what to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge Spit and Justin Thomas's sports form, which they played together all day and each of them took three of the four possible points.
Spit shows a great form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The offensive attacks on the fans were getting stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise hit he compared the results in the fourth match, after Thomas and two hits after the first two holes.
His attack, which won the match on the 15th floor, was met with strong shocks that convince us that everything is not really lost for the American team.
"It's important that you don't think about anything else and focus on your own game," Spit says.
That's all that's left for these players right now.
18 pieces to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spiet and Thomas in the last two days are French Mollinaires and Tommy Fletted, the fearless heroes of the "Rader Cup" so far.
The strange but exciting couple from Europe won four out of four, and they seem to get everything.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make a "bogie" on Sunday afternoon, but they didn't have a "bug" either in the morning or in the afternoon.
These consecutive successes, as well as the way the energy passed between them and the enthusiasts, have confirmed the idea that they are players who will win in the week and there will be no better couple than Flytted and Molinari, who will bring Europe's potential win as the sun goes over Le Golf National.
To prefer both at the same time on different points.
However, the exhibitions of the European celebration proved to be a little too early.
Buba Watson and Weeb Simpson were quick to deal with Serhio Garcia, the hero of the Foreball games in the morning while he was sharing with Alex Norren.
"Bogies" and two "bugs" of the first nine points put the Spanish and Swedish into problems that they failed to deal with.
But in Sunday's games, there's no other way to solve your problems.
"Foreball" and "Forsom" games are extremely interesting to look close to the interaction between the two, the advice they exchange between themselves, and the way in which a strategy can undergo changes at any time.
Europeans played a better team, and so they had a significant advantage before the last day, but this session of the "Forsom" game showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were seriously doubting.
Europe runs from 10 to 6 in the last day of the "Rader Cup".
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of the "Rader Cup" after it led the US with 10-6 after the game of the "for ball" and "forsom" games on Saturday.
The inspiring debate began with two victories against the incredible Tiger Woods, with which their activity at the "Le Golf National" competition grew four points.
In an attempt to bring back the trophies that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bourne dominated tomorrow's "for ball" game over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and finally Europe won the series of 3–1 victories.
The U.S. has shown more opposition to the Forsom, where two victories won, but they have failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furrick's team needs 8 points from the 12th game of a single week to keep the trophies.
Fletwood was the first novelist in Europe, he drew four points, and he and Molinari, known as Molywood, after this sensory weekend, became the second two, winning four points from his first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After Uuds and Patrick Reid played the game in the Foreball, they were extremely motivated to win the Wuds and American novelist Brison Decambu with yet more category 5&4 results.
Woods, who barely passed through his two games on Saturday, only from time to time showed signs of his generality, but so far there are 19 losses of 29 March in the Foreball and the Forsom, as well as seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the tomorrow's "forball" game, shares with Henrik Stanson in the "forsom" with the successes of winning 2&1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka – the number one and three in the world.
The European team, however, failed to enjoy a very friendly, cold and uncluttered day in the south-west of Paris.
Triangular winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas returned the Americans' hopes, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a hard victory with 2§1 against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "Foreball" game, and later they returned to defeat Polter and Rory Makillroy with 4&3 in the "Forsom" meetings, although they lost the first two points.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has happened to raise four points of deficit before the syndicates, as the Furic team's regulation will maintain the trophies even at the same time.
However, after they had been over for two consecutive days, it seems that their chances of returning the week did not seem particularly great.
North Korea says "no way" to be armed privately, without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea reported to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions undermine the confidence of the United States and that the country is not able to give up its nuclear weapons exclusively under such circumstances.
At the annual World Organisation's general meeting, Ri Young-How said that in the past year there have been "a significant measure of good will", for example, halting nuclear and rocket tests, destroying the nuclear test object and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without our trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and in no circumstances will there be a first way to unarm ourselves."
While Rey expressed the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's "sustained" approach to the removal of the nuclear weapon, in which North Korea would be restored, since it had taken further action, his statement seemed significant, since he did not reject the single nuclear equipment as Phenyan did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Nun and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "a simple armament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump gave security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is heading for the official end of the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, but from the United States they say that Phenyan should first withdraw from his nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the calls for relief of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"U.S. urges 'first remove nuclear weapons' and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even protest against 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem is, however, that the continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri has not mentioned whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump is planned, for which the United States leader stressed the UN earlier a week ago.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun J-Yen over the last five months and added: "If the country concerned with nuclear disarmament was South Korea, instead of the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a stop.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the reference to North Korean rockets to the continental part of the United States was inevitable, after the "bad President" Trump called Kim "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at UN Tromp, which threatened North Korea with "full destruction" last year, Kim commended his coach for taking arms, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
In the afternoon, Trump stressed that there was no time for this and said: “It doesn’t matter if we take two years, three or five months. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyan for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should not be continued until nuclear weapons are fully completed, final and confirmed."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of the Phenyan nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met Ri at UN General Assembly culors and then said he would visit Phenyan again the next month to prepare a second meeting on top.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was a good one.
He left Phenyan in July with the words that he had made progress, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of sending "ganger demands".
At a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promises to destroy a rocket object and nuclear complex if the United States takes "the relevant measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "relevant measures", to which we are referring, are the security guarantees Trmp promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard's enough rest course
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all students to sleep more in an attempt to acquire the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students in university number one in the world often don't even think when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Kaysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, prepared a course for which he thinks he's the first in his class in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep loss on learning.
"Then a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me even now, in my last year?"
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of the dream that surprises me," he said before The Telegraph.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, explains to students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found out that students suffer from a serious sleep loss during the week.
The same time course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a society where students jump on coffee, teas, maratons and books to explain the effects of coffee and light, how sports achievements are affected by sleeplessness as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
On the other hand, participants are told how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of infection, insulin, depression and cancer.
After that, a map of the campsite with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change students' behaviour.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," adds Professor Kaysler.
The culture of pride of "learning all night" still exists, he says, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep loss is a growing problem.
The provision of adequate and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even with the aim of avoiding filling, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger, which makes them forever hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes during his first year in Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the camp.
It is hoped that the next step is that all students have completed their request to complete such a training program before joining the competition institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends that students consider whether to set up a bedtime and wake-up alarm and to know the valuable effects of "the light of the sun", emitted by the electronic screens and the light - day lighting that can disrupt the circuit rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Gol broke Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's joke broke Stephen Gerard's team and won from 1 to 0 to Livingston.
The Aybros team wanted to record its first triumph as a triumpha guest in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team had barely brought Gerard's second defeat in his 18th fight as manager, who left his team with eight points less than Harts' late team, leader in the High League of Ladbrokes.
Menga noticed seven minutes before the break, and the constructive idea of the Rangers team at no time seemed close to balance.
After the fight, Rangers got out in six places, and Livingston's already three, leaving the second hybrid only on the head.
For Rangers there may also be additional problems, as the side judge Kalum Spence got a head wound after being hit by an object that was apparently fired from the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that graphed Er in the semi-finals of the Scotland League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with Livingston's same segregator, who turned out a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team was in the same way that all the actions of the opponent were in.
Rangers may have ruled the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to notice again in the second minute, when Menga took out a touch with Scott Pittman against the traitor Alan McGregor, but the defendant missed a good chance.
Later, Kevin Jacobs' focus on the failure found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Litgou, turned the ball away from the back yard.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a period of 15 minutes when he broke up with Stephen Lawles, but the referendum Stephen Thompson rejected the claims of the Colombians.
The Rangers only launched two direct attacks in the first half, but the ex-trovert from Ibrox Liam Kelly was easy to deal with the attack with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak shot of this Ejaria.
Although Livi's fall in the 34th minute was surprising in view of the ball's possession, it was fully deserved.
Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' deep concentration again.
Scott Archfield doesn't react when Declan Galler sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who coldly handed Menga who was easy to realize.
Gerard reacts to the rest by changing Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately led to the result when the call passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out resolutely and blocked the attack.
Livingstone, however, continued to urge guests to play in a comfortable way for the domestic style of the game, as Litgou and Halket constantly rejected the sent forward long balls.
Holt's team could raise its front in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to handle Jacobs' strike, and with Colonel Litgou's shooting with his head on the roof.
The entrance as a reserve of Glen Medalton from Rangers sought a drop at the end of the two following a fight with Jacobs, but Tomson saw nothing wrong in the situation.
Year: The Founder of the Hedger Number
Page of our daily Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, before 136 years and BROENE... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Gaiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method for generating and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as a hogerov number.
A rock rock in science since then, the hogger’s number has also turned into the final rock of the culture of the pop, when in 1950 the film "Camps of Coronado", which was attended by apparently amazing students Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What a God that is!
Rogers: It's a hero number and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put these hearings, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans says, "I'm sure it's right now!"
Hans Gaiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to exist.
New cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them into the laboratory
Then they can "see" protein, which is common to many types of cancer and are re-injected into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, has seen her liver cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein, common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-inject it into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Institute of Ecology in Betezda, Meriland, "Our results assume that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, eggs, white breasts and colorectal carcinoma, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immunosuppression cells from patients and their "learning" to target cancer cells was used to treat leukemia.
Kenny West gave a word in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the title "Let's do America big again," while participating in SNL.
I didn't go well.
Kenny West was quoted in the study during Saturday Night Live, after making a meaningless performance, in which US President Donald Trump said he would apply for president in 2020.
After completing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the title "Let's do America Great Again", he announced against the democracies and said his support for Trump.
"I often talk to whites and they ask me, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd leave America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with the participation of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star is playing witness to Bret Kavana's testimony to the Senate's legal commission on sexual violence complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it wasn't released, West's performance record was posted on social networks by Cris Rock's comic.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
In addition, West complained before the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was traumatized behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with this hat."
I'm being traumatized!
And then they claim I'm on a floating ship," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the moving ship?" saying that he will dress up Superman's costume, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try with love."
Comments caused at least twice the public reflections and SNL team members seemed embarrassed, reports Variety, as one of them said: "The whole studio closed."
West was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
It's just a lot of stuffing with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as the button "Perio".
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: BLAGODARY YOU HAVE BEEN EXTENDED IN THE TALPA."
However, the tour guide Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "he was himself and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward a person (that I buy his music or his clothing or support his "his art"), who I think is welcome and spreads an ideology that is valuable to society.
He's free.
We're like that," she added.
Before the show the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, as now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Dedi, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, Rapper Snap Dog was called Snap Lawn, and the music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Indictment for an attempted murder after a knife was found in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with an attempted murder, after he was armed with a knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackmore, they call it by the police.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor.
The star of "The Game and the Trons" Kit Harington is against the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as John Snou's shining sword in the violent middle-aged fantasy series of the NWO "Tron Game".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, complained against the stereotype of a Maco hero, saying that showing such roles leads to young people often to think that they should be "great" to be respected.
In an interview for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes that "something's been wrong" and asked how to deal with the issue of toxicity in #MeToo's age.
Keith, who recently married his partner from the "Tron Games" game, also in 31 C.E., admits that he feels "very confident" that this problem must be solved.
"At the moment I'm personally very confident – what have we been wrong with men?" he said.
"What do we learn about the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television can sometimes be responsible for increasing toxicity due to many men's personalities.
He continues: “What is sown, and what does it bear?
What does television and the street teach the boys feel they have to turn into this particular guy?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also recognized that he would not participate in the premise or continuation of the "Tron game" after the end of the series in the following summer, claiming that he had "closed with the warplanes and horses".
Since November, Kitt will play a part in Sam Shepard's "The True West" restoration, the story of film producer and his brother who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said his wife's acquaintance with Rose was the best thing that happened in the "Tron Game".
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead of me," he said.
Rose plays the game, the girl in which Kit John Snow's hero loves, in the fantasy series, the winner of Amy's prize.
The two concluded marriage in June 2018 in the property of Lesley's family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people have been affected.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases have been reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts that notice changes compared with the past.
Traditional HIV is spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood flow.
However, the number of people infected with HIV this way is estimated almost zero, saying from China's health services at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Nevertheless, each year, the number of HIV and back in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was determinized in China in 1997 but discrimination against people in the CBT communities was widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values 70–90% of men who had sexual contact with men were finally married to women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Wathers refuses to have data collected by senators from the Republican party, vowing "the dangerous lies" and "the theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Wathers condemned the charges that a member of her team has published personal information to three state senators from the republics of the lawmakers' websites in Wikipedia.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said the claims were made by experts and websites of the "ultra right wing".
"false, false and even disgusting lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The information published includes the addresses and telephone numbers of the state senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Yuta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitolia during the hearing of the Senate's statement on sexual misconduct against the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Kavanau.
The withdrawal is effective after the three senators asked Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of publications is linked to the Waters office, and sent information about its team member, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and absolute lies," said Waters.
"The member of my team — whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and false claims — is not in any way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
It's an inexhaustible claim that it's totally dishonest and it's an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly caused criticism online, including by the former Prescekretor of the White House of Ari Flasher.
"There's a famine in this denial," Flesher wrote.
“This suggests that it does not have the temperature suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
I don't have to ask the prosecutor's reasons.
It must be peaceful and balanced."
Fisher compares Waters' reaction to the criticism by the democratics of Judge Kavano, who was accused of the criticisms that he also seemed mad during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate from the republics for Waters' position in the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Mainally, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office had set up the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these false claims.
"We will be sure that the performers will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
John Inglesh's Revenge Renewal – the weak Spanish family with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Bresit in every new film with British participation, and it seems that this is also relevant for the ex-Commenianisation of the Spanish franchise for Johnny Inglich, who started with John Ingles in 2003 and returned in 2011 with John Ingles.
Will the self-smokers and the monkeys who say how obvious it is that we are stupid will turn into a new chance to export the nation?
In any case, the incapacitated John Inglesh has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is the most important when it becomes a word for a great comic book, intended for admirers of the Chinese who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for a favor, has a little bit owned by Cluzo, a little from Mr. Bin and a large part of the man who brought with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the Olympic Games ceremony in London in 2012.
In addition, it is primarily based on the remaining chaos behind itself as a traveler and an international man who Atkinson plays in the already forgotten Barclaycard television ads.
The last movie with Johnny Inglesh has two nice moments.
My love, when Johnny Inglesh approached the helicopter, wearing a middle-aged armor, and for a short time, the puppies were stuck in his shoulder.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedy and visible, but the humor is quite weak and strange, especially when "serious" films such as "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humort seems more directed to the children than to the adults, and Johnny Inglesh's crazy evils, I think, are not innovative and focused, since Mr. Benny's no act of Actinson's memory.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Kiberhacker has hacked the British super secret network from spy and has discovered the identity of all operational agents for fear of the daily agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last chapter of the Prime Minister, which is the hope and a better figure and already suffering from the full stream of political instability: Emma Thompson gives everything to himself for this quasi-Treza-May role, but the scenario has nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that she should call a retired agent, since all the agents involved are compromised.
And that means Johnny Inglich, who is currently working as a teacher at a rock center, who is teaching illegally how to be an agent undercover: here are some good falls when Inglich condemns a Spanish rock academy.
English has been called in Whitehol for successful training and is reunited with his former long-term assistant Bo, re-played by Ben Miller.
Because he's already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a happy role in which Vicki Peperdin's talent is little lost.
And so, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of her Majesty's secret services and get involved with the fatal beauty of Ophelia Bulettova, played by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has fallen under the dangerous influence of charismatic technology billionaires who claim to be able to solve British computer problems: evil Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
England and Bo start their dress from the fascist: dressed as servers, they fire a French restaurant; they create chaos when they walk on the luxury garden of Volta; and England causes real anarchy when they try to use a screen for virtual reality to identify the interior of Walt's house.
All smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since there are so many sympathies and fights, there's a lot more content for children.
A lot of medium production.
Like other movies about Johnny Inglesh, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that meets his talent?
The librarians refuse to develop the British plan to work four days a week, but to get five payouts.
Jeremy Corbin's Liberian Party is considering a radical plan for the British to work for four weeks, but to get five payouts.
The party claims that the company's heads want to provide the economies made by the revolutionary artificial intelligence (III) to the workers by giving them another day of rest.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but they get the same pay.
The source says that the idea would "pass" on the economic programme and party plans to disband the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to four-day working weeks is approved by the Congress of Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
Further source from the Liberian party said before The Sunday Times: “It is expected before the end of the year to be notified of a policy review.
"It won't happen immediately, but the four-day working week is a strike that is recorded in the economy-rebalanced approach for workers as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Liberian party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promises a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this strike does not meet the approval of the whole Liberian party.
The lecturer said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's politics I don't think about it."
The Chancellor in the Shadow John McDonald uses the lab conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take the authority back from "other directors" and "expectors" in the community services companies.
The Chancellor plans in the shadow also mean that these owners of parts of water supply companies may not receive their entire share, since the Liberian government could impose "delays" on the basis of the infringements imposed.
In addition, he confirmed the plans to put workers in the company's boards and to create private funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private companies of employees who can group annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk before "60 minutes" if Kavan's investigation by the FBI can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bret Kavano has stopped the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings could cause some of the senators from the Republican party to withdraw their support.
In an interview last week, the "60 minutes" correspondent Scott Pelly asked the senators from the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the accident and asked him: “Did you do it?
He was decisive, categorical and unintended."
But Graham's voice seemed uncomplicated.
"I have an opinion about Bret Kavano and to change it, there is a need to investigate the charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret rejected him categorically," said Graham, turning to Christine Blasy Ford.
"And no one she mentioned, but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What does the "Global Citizens" festival represent, and does it help to reduce poverty?
This week, New York will be hosted by the “Global Citizens” Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and also fulfills such an impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the "Global citizen" festival will gather tens of thousands of people of the great sea in the Central Park, which will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardie Bi and Sean Mendes, but will also meet with the real goal of the event – the eradication of exceptional poverty by 2030.
The "Global citizen" festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for the IPP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as voluntary participation, sending not to a world leader, calling on the telephone or otherwise to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizens 12 years before they reach their goal?
Is the idea of restoring people with free concert is a generic way to be convinced to demand action or is it just another case of "clicitism" – people think they do something important when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been written by its supporters, who are pursuing many different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its actions, such as already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the secured funds have already been directly affected by around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include "The Power of Food", established in the UK partnership between investors and executives, commitment to "supporting children to develop their full potential", which promises Rwanda to grant $35 million to help stop malnutrition in the country after more than 4700 posts have been received on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens like you we can turn social injustice into a historical note only," said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in front of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken, which call for the UK to improve the food of mothers and children, the government has reported on financing a project, "The Power of Food", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of his website's CZW, he asked, "Why do you think we can stop the extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" replied: This will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will break and we will break up again.
But also in the great movement of civil rights and against apartheid before us we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardie Bi, Janel Mona are just some of the performers of that annual event in New York, to which the leaders will be Deborah and Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use military forces to "block" and prevent energy exports – Minister of Internal Affairs
Washington may, if necessary, flee to its military forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinc, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria – more specifically, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a precedent for examining new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the person responsible, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our military forces, guarantee that the maritime roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink turned to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with a non-stop target, which is presented as a "vote of energy users" in the United States.
He intended to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulated and replaced by fuel," he said, while identifying Russia as "one-number couples", with an economy dependent on fuel consumed.
The statement comes at a time when the Trump administration has a task of strengthening the export of liquid gas for Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much more balanced option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the administration of Trump, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project "Severe stream 2", which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into a "relative".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion pipeline of North Stream 2 will double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres is a purely economic project.
Krell argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project has been driven simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be an instrument for the exercise of pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative reaction from Germany which reaffirms its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), called on the United States not to engage in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third party is mixed in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a quick meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the president's candidate in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "look serious" at the president's candidate after the inter-election.
During a city council in Hollioke, Massachuzets Waron confirmed that I was thinking of applying.
"It's time for women in Washington to come in and correct our division of government and this includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will take a serious look at the president's application."
Warren expressed his assessment of President Donald Trump during the City Council, saying that he “takes this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed to his criticism of Trump and his high court candidate Bret Kavano.
In a post on Twitter on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological study carried out on Thursday, however, showed that most of the voters in Uron themselves do not think that it should be applied in 2020.
Fifty and eight per cent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidate.
The sociological study showed more support for the candidateship of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other high-ranking representatives of the democratic party discussed on potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Bayden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Bayden said we're going to take an official decision in January, reports Associated Press.
Sara Palin pointed to the PTSR of Trak Pallin's Mitting for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after the writing in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, after returning, is the knowledge of other families who feel the consequences of PTSR and some of the wounds our soldiers are taking," she said before the audience of the interviewing for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "slon in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little bit changed, raped, come back and wonder if they will get this respect, which they and their armed brothers have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennet, spokesman of Vasila's police administration.
18 states and surrounding Colombia support the opposition of the new asylum policy
The 18 states and surrounding Colombia support the judicial opposition to a new US policy that rejects the asylum of victims of gangs and domestic violence.
In the fifth of the 18th states and districts, there was a request for good will in Washington to support the search for asylum and to defend the policies reported by NBC News.
The entire name of the case was not disclosed in the case of Grace vs Sesions, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union submitted to the federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of his gang's cruel members" abused her, but US officials rejected the request for asylum on July 20th.
She's kept in Texas.
U.S. lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come as nations facing comprehensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy in the area of asylum returned the decision of the 2014 Refugee Council, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia lawyer Carl Rosen says on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered in accordance with specific facts and circumstances and such prohibition violates this principle," says the report of good will.
In addition, lawyers claim in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants' entry into the U.S. economy is worth considering that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary working hand."
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sesions ordered judges on immigration cases to stop the provision of asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gangster violence.
"Escape is given to those who leave their family because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief," Sesions said in his July report on politics.
The refugee was never meant to solve all the problems – not even all the serious ones – before people get up every day, everywhere in the world.
Expected rescue efforts in Palu, while death cases are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very excited," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick boy at an evacuation center in the abandoned city of Palu.
"Every minute the line carries more bodies.
The clean water is in vain."
The inhabitants are noted to return to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their alleged possessions.
Hundreds of people are injured, and patients affected by earthquakes with 7.5 have been completed.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered from spinal cord and shoulder cuts, were outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated openly because of the continued secondary strokes.
His eyes filled with tears when he remembered how he felt the terrible earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was forced into the destroyed wall," said Harris before Associated Press, adding that he came to the city with his family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "thromoz" with "propagandism"
One week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page statement in the US Daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa – after he accused China of trying to get involved in the American Congress elections on 6 November.
The Tromp's accusation that Peki is trying to introduce the American Congress elections noted what American officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's scaling campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue commercial promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in a school-based trade war, which compares import rates between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China at the beginning of the trade-related military tariffs in China, it was intended to hit exporters in states such as Ayova, which supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former former governor of Ayova, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing had lost American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a comment on Sunday's number of Des Moines Register, "at the moment this brake is doubled by leaving propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, China's government is using the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and press, leaving a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"In contrast, in a newspaper store down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real impact on the various opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic tragedy, meaning that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese journalists avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify who.
In the wake of Cavano, the Republicans criticize voting women for inter-elections, warning analysts
Since many of the high-ranking republics stand behind and defend the nominations for Supreme Court Bret Kavano for several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that there would be a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming inter-elections.
The emotions around it are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Rahr, professor of politics at Maxwell University in Syracuse, before The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahr said he wondered if the latest pressure of Senator Jeff Fleek (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierer, an senior adviser and a national speaker for the progressive moveOn group on Friday, according to a Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protestors scheduled "November to come!" during a demonstration in the Senate's corridor, as the republics that control the judicial commission decided to continue with Kavano's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Kristin Blasy Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be eliminated," said the newsman Stu Rottenberg, a non-participated political analyst.
"The voices say the problem is already serious; that's true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among electoral women in the front and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before the Ford's public testimony describing her sexual assault charges against the nomination of the Supreme Court, analysts assume that she can follow a response if the Republicans insist on confirming the application.
"This has turned into a big obstacle to the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavano is put on the scale. It is about how the republics deal with this and how it relates to it," said the press channel Guy Cessil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose democracy.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided in some way on who to believe as a result of the demonstrations of Ford and Cavano, as little more than the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of the respondents believe in Ford's statements defined or likely and 35 per cent say that they believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 percent say that they think Kavano is probably lying or certainly lying during his show, while 30 percent also claim for Ford.
Following pressure from Fleek at the moment, the FBI is investigating Ford's claims as well as at least one other prosecutor, Debra Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford's testimony under oath to the Senate's court commission that Kavano attacked her in an emergency when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals in front of her while they were at the party during her 80's trial at Yale.
World Wide Web Developer Plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The creator of the World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lie starts a process that aims to oppose Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technologies, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with the open code of Burners-Lie Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people have access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Burners-Ley, it turns out that the purpose behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the way.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "online personal data" or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available on every browser, and at the same time all of them are simultaneously.
The only thing that can be found in the online personal data store is that the user determines who the information is available.
The company calls it "right to provide personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of the company John Bruce, is to put resources, processes and appropriate skills in order to help Solid become available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Burners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform, bought by IBM, several developers, concluded a project work contract, and a group of volunteers programmers.
This week, world technology developers can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not when all their business models are completely renewed for one night.
"We do not want permission from them."
In a press release on Wednesday, Brenners-Ley wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the solid base.
In 1994, Berners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months Burners-Lie has had a strong influence on the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although starting Inrupt, Burners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new age on the Internet," adds Burns-Lie.
Bernard Van: in the memory of the priest who was granted the cross Victoria during World War I
100 years are observed in the home of the only English priest who has been authorized by the cross of Victoria for his participation in the war during World War I.
Under-Secretary-General Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 at the Bellenglis and Lehacourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a gunman, without knowing that he was granted the highest military respect in Britain.
A memorable memorial was opened on Saturday by his two grandsons, on a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that the monument was "exclusively symbolic" to be discovered 100 years from his grandfather's work, made up of medals.
According to London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van took his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a lot of men and heavy artillery and cartels."
Later, he attacked the fire line and with “unbelieving courage” took the building forward, before he attacked the artillery army with one hand and killed three of the crew.
Colonel Van was killed by a German snowman on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but he made me calm."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set up a vein after the council, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that for him it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the goodness of the real hero is demonstrated through the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been waiting all night for a full edition of Bellator 206 and you can't finally become a witness to the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 doubles, including six of the main map and was supposed to be released alive during the night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just when Gegard Mosesi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the British viewers remained shocked when the transfer changed Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they had been building up until early hours, especially because of doubt.
Fen described on Twitter the conversion of the child's animation film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The Authority regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the programme has been modified with child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, the senior vice-president on the marketing and communication of Bellator, in response to the issue of discharge.
"Peppa porsto," yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Kokker said they would work on planning the meetings to include the views of Britain in the future.
"I think that when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six mornings a week, and there is no way to plan things so that the event is going to take place on Sunday, and there is Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that way, it was the government.
I can promise you the next time this will not happen.
We're going to stick to the inclusion of five two instead of six, as we usually do. We've tried to give more to the fans, but we've gone.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "lower" because of his sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daily says he's grown, feeling lower than all the others because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman claims that until he started studying in high school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview on the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he talked about the rights of gays to give others a "hope."
He also said that when he became a parent, he started to be less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent leader of the long-term show, Christy Young, is in the hospital for a few months.
In his first Lavern Daily program, he said he felt "less" than all the others while he grew up, because "he wasn't socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “To this day the feeling of low self - worth and the fact that I am different from the others are, in fact, things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and used his participation in the British community's annual games in Australia to launch a call for more countries to delimite homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and he wanted to breathe the “hope ” of others.
The triangular world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – he was "extended."
Daily concluded a marriage with Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than him last year, but claims that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you pass through so much as you are so young," he participates for the first time in the Olympic Games of 14 years, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "it's hard to find someone at your age who has lived through such incomes and losses."
Both became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Dali, and Daily himself says "all his peace looks" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I'd tell you that I'm just interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized to his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets for the Olympic Games in London in 2012 – because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be with me, Dad, or at first," he said.
"I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at this point, when I realized he was dead, I finally realized that he was not innocent," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew I've been dreaming about it all my life – to jump the Olympics before the audience at home. There was no more fear," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Smol – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him jump.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
Miss Michaelson's lost shape remains on the radar team on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will put a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he's gonna have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be related to failure.
Michaelson, who participated in the two-year record event for the 12th time, was left on the scene by Captain Jim Furic for "for ball" and "forsom" the game on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the US election, the fifth winner of large tournaments spent his day as a fan and training his attacks from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old sportsman who was never even on top of his career was among the most legal players, is not in an optimal form for the hard game of Le Golf National, where the long-distance field usually condemns every wrong hit.
And if the game alone isn't worrying enough, in the ninth game on the week of Mikkelson, it's going to be against the exact champion of British Open French Molinaires, who's in a team with novelty Tommy Flytted and trying to win all their four matches this week.
If the Americans who left four points before the 12th single match make a strong start, it could be that Michaelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his colleague, even though he could barely say something much different.
"He fully understood his role today, he grabbed me, turned me over and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furic.
"He's trusted in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Glory and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't suggest he only play in two games.
I was hoping he'd play more, but that's what he did, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be at golf and play, just like everyone else."
Michaelson will improve Nick Faldo's record of the biggest game in the Ryder Cup, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never been closer to his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and seven equal matches, but Furic said his presence also brings other benefits to the team that don't measure with numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think even younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than that just to play."
Thomas Bourne, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big gate can soon be stopped
The European team's captain, Thomas Bourne, knows from personal experience that the big gate, collected before the flag's match since the last day of the "Rader Cup", can be easily removed.
The date is due to the fight of "Valderrama" in 1997, when the Captain's team, Seve Balisteros, led five points ahead of the Americans, but the final law was almost achieved and I barely succeeded in holding the victory with 141⁄2-131/2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage of "Valderrama"; we had a great advantage and a Brookline" where we lost, and Valderrama had won, but very difficult," Bourne said, after the 2018 European team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and Thursday, with 10-6 on "Le Golf National:.
So the story has to show me and everyone in the team that it's not all over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Get out and do what you need.
Nothing's done until you see the final result of the table.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this trophies, and that's exactly what we need to keep focused on.
All the time, I repeated that I was thinking only of the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our opponents, who are one of the biggest players in the world."
Happy to present the players to a difficult golf course, Bourne added: “I would never rush to the holidays.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's ahead, the individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner, when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, you're gonna test your whole ability as a golf player.
This is the message that must reach players: tomorrow you must give your best.
Now you can turn your partner's back as well as he should give himself up to the end."
Unlike Bourne, opponent's captain Jim Furic will ask his players to present themselves better individually than partners, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four possible points.
Furic himself was also from both sides of these big returns in the last day – he was part of the "Brockline" triumph, and then he was from the lost country when the Europeans performed the "Minnah's miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question like Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"In the morning we have 12 important games, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at "Brockline", as well as "Medinah".
When the advantage passes from one direction to another, these intertwines are playing under tremendous pressure.
That's why we formed our composition and divided our boys as we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Tomas has been commissioned to take our counterattack and face Rory Makillroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytted and Jan Poller will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the facility.
"I chose these players in this order because I think this gives us the greatest chance of success," Bourne said about her choice for the singles.
Germany reiterates the launch of a new warship
The latest flag of the German fleet was to be introduced into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships from the time of the Cold War, but this will not be achieved until next year because of the unjust systems and mainly rising costs reported by local media.
The entry into operation of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the lead ship of the brand new flag from the Baden-Wuertmberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a spokesman of the army.
The Navy court had to join the military forces in 2014, but the problems arising after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttenberg class ship, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the old flag from the Bremen class.
We understand that they will have a powerful weapon, a collection of anti-aircraft and antiship rockets, as well as some steel technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of support – the latest brakes should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the port of residence.
However, the continuous entertainment means that the Hungarian military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when they enter the operation, notes Die Zeit.
F125 F125 entered the title of last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the shipyard court into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipbuilding plant in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship to the ship after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship useless if sent to a military mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttenberg class sailing courts will be managed by a crew of about 120 seafarers – only half of the crew of the older flags of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship is significantly overrun, which reduces its effectiveness and restricts the possibility of military forces to add future threats.
It is thought that the 7000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" are twice more difficult than the ships of such a class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including training of the team, is also becoming a problem.
It is believed that it reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of the recent warning that German military forces are falling.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament defence committee, admitted that the fleet is actually "exceeding from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The responsible person said that the problem had become bigger in time, since the old ships were driven out of operation, but no new ones were provided.
He complains that not one of the classes of Baden-Wuertmenberg can't be included in the fleet.
The National Cross Follows the Secret Life of the Apaches
A new study carried out in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how the birds use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the discovery will shed new light on the conduct of the unique flight crews and will help with the management of future precautions.
The study of students from Scotland’s National Press will often follow the hot spots as well as the coffee streams at Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the property to track the actions of the applets during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the calls of the appetizers as well as the types that issue them.
Then they will be prepared the map of the location and report to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, a conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of location are most important to the applets and how they are used in any way.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the location management work, such as the creation of libads, as well as the best way to maintain the mountain areas for the carpets and other related species.
In Scotland and Great Britain, the populations of apples have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to the loss of habitats.
Population risk may be caused by wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of construction materials as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the wings are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a stick.
They use an improved ecosystem to absorb insects and obstacles to their flight trajectory.
NTSC, responsible for care for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 buildings of great importance and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes very seriously.
The strain has trained experts who conduct regular studies, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first one in Scotland and the only special reserve for trailers in Threave in the Dampris and Galway area, which is home to eight of the ten species that are caught in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says it's an ideal territory for them.
"But, in Threave, we have a wonderful field for the beads," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and a complete suitable location.
But there are many more things about the attractive ones that are unknown, so the work we do here and in other things will help us to understand better what they need in order to survive."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of pills prior to carrying out activities to support property, since it is possible to destroy one asylum to kill up to 400 women and young people, as well as to destroy the entire local population.
The prey are a kind of protection and it's illegal to kill, tortourise, upset, or destroy their refugees.
Elizabeth Ferl, a Scottish officer in Trusta, encouraged the community to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our beautiful and many animal species, because we just don't know what's going on with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape and his lawyers will judge a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo defined the allegations of rape against him as “false news”, saying that people “want to become known” using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of strengthening American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that after that he paid her $375,000 to cover the incident reported to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the 33-year-old Ronaldo closed the publication as a "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," said the camera's fifth-time carrier of the Gold Ball.
"They want to be known by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to collect popularity on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the footballist smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to judge Der Spiegel for the claims called "unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the footballist would seek an improvement in "moral wages in terms of the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at night's club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the football club room, where they claimed that he had persecuted her in an analytical manner, according to the documents submitted to the District Court of Clarke in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" of 99 percent, but in the case he simply gave up "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's documents, he confirmed that they were having sex, but that's what happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an external agreement, because she felt "recorded by punishment" and worried not to be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
During the incident, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian border Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Breszite: The United Kingdom "I'm sorry forever" that it lost the car manufacturers
The UK "is still sorry" if it lost its status as a world leader in the production of cars after Breszite, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it's "responsive" that Toyota UK told BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop its production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the cross-border entertainment in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to loss of jobs.
In the city of Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced, nearly 150 000 cars have been produced last year, 90% of which have been exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the Great Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March, the production in our industry will stop," said Marvin Kuk, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade would operate.
BMW, for example, says they're gonna close their business for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Breszite.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risk of delivery risk in cases of Brexit without a transaction.
Toyota's production line is working on the "time-to-time" principle as the parts reach every 37 minutes of suppliers from Britain and the EU for cars developed by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, which, according to the industry, may lead to some entertainment and lack of part.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to complete their venture in Darbisher, they said from the company, and that is why the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "schat" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We must have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but also to be able to capture this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's program 4's Today.
"In the light of the claims not only to Toyota, but also to other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to ensure successful delivery times."
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be overdue, but in a longer-term plan they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the profession and ultimately lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Cavalaris, who has been a founder of the Union for 24 years, says that his members are increasingly concerned: “I think that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
The government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be resumed, says the White House.
The extremely important meeting between Donald Tramp with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein can be "deployed for another week", as he continues to fight for Supreme Court Bret Kavano, reports the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the relations between Tromp and Russia's assistants and the potential obstacle to the justice of the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy chief prosecutor, or not, in this way will threaten Muler's independence, for months he will provide the hearings for Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to write talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejects this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports of leaving.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced on Thursday.
Tromp said he would "pretend not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was suspended to avoid the conflict with the hearing before the Senate's legal commission, which witnessed both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of the complaints against Cavano, even more fun with the full vote of the Senate.
Trip's speaker, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is not yet the date for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court, as I think it may be for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would object to this statement: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on 10 September.
The transmission leader Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders said that regular preconventions were not due to "the demonstration behaviour" of television journalists, although he said, "I can't say I don't agree with the fact that they have a demonstration."
Then she indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is conducting more meetings with questions and answers from every president before him," she said, in addition, without quoting the evidence: "We have examined these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, continued Sanders, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often, and you're witnesses to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conferences after you have the opportunity to speak to the president of the United States."
Trip regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or preconventions with visiting seniors.
Possible preconventions are rare.
This week in New York, the president may show why, with his eccentric behavior and at moments of strangeness before the gathered journalists.
Health Minister turned to EU workers in Scotland's National Health Service on fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed in writing to EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service to express their appreciation for the state and their desire to stay in their place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before the arrival of the UK from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions to be expected.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible scenario without a transaction.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to remind you of the great value of the contribution of each servant, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and from there contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, such as this is of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie's been through an emergency operation after she got a headache.
Tenesi State Tyggers, Krischen Abrkrombi, suffered a sudden operation after getting trauma on his head during the meeting on Saturday, when his team lost Vanderbilt Commodors from 31-27, told Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The senior coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, shared with reporters that the trauma happened a little before the half hour.
"He went to the side line and just got there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abbrombie oxygen on the side line, before it was placed on the nose and brought to the eye for further review.
A servant of Tennessee State confirmed before Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the nature/serious nature of the trauma", as well as that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Abbrombie, a secondary college graduate, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, which makes 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher gross tax on the purchase of real estate in Britain
According to new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher burden on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralise the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the Serbian tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The state house expects an increase of more than 120 million British pounds per year, which will help homeless people
Tereza May will today announce the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in Britain, as additional income will go to help homeless people.
At this stage it will look like an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible housing and is directed towards people with high incomes.
The increase in the Serbian tax will affect natural persons and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, as with additional incomes will help the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The addition – which is an addition to the current gross tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for the second residences and properties purchased for the purpose of granting – may amount to up to three per cent.
The state budget expects progress to be increased by up to 120 million British pounds per year.
About 13 per cent of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by citizens outside the UK, leading to price increases and making it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to enter the property market.
Many of the rich areas, especially in the capital, have turned into "extraordinary cities", due to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy will appear only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in herbage order to help more young people have their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property, stealing the land, but not using it, and asked Ms. May to leave the quotas for accessible housing in order to fix the UK's "response to housing".
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including control of loans and the end of the "without wine".
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “In the past year, I shared that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means we're going to fix our housing market.
Great Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it's not fair people who don't live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy themselves as easily as the hardworking people in Britain are.
Too many people dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the collapse of the street sleep remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My goal is to lead the Scotland team"
Soundland manager Jack Ross said "the biggest ambition" in his career is to be the senior trainer of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of creating a club from northeastern England, which is currently located in the third position in the First League, three points from the first place.
He crossed the stadium of Latt this summer after the last season took St. Miron back to Scotland's High League.
"I wanted to play for my family as a player.
I wrote a game for the B team and that was all," Ross said before the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up with the hunts of Hempden, which we as a child looked at with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"But this opportunity would only open if I had success at the club level."
Among the predecessors of Ross as managers of the Sandland are Dick Lawyers, David Mois, Sam Alardies, Martin O'Neill, Roy Caine, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik's former adviser said he did not experience anxiety as a descendant of such established names in such a significant club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnes and Ipsuic Town.
"To me the success at the moment will be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because according to the structure, base and conditions it is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get back to the highest football level, but I'll accept that I've achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross is a manager for only three years, after he spent some time as an assistant at Dumberton and 15 months at Harts' training level.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miron from a falling team into a winner in Chempanship during the next season.
Ross shared that he now feels more comfortable than during his football career in Clyde, Hartlipoul, Volkerk, St. Miron and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the cross," he remembered about the time when he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager is the best way for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds strange because I was doing good, I made good money, and I had some significant success.
But sometimes it's hard to be a player.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, when I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin all my conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, discovering research
The summer's heat increased the income of the combatants to save British poppys, but there was more pressure on the faithful restaurants.
The pop and bar groups reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, shows statistics.
Peter Martin of the Business Consultant CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: "For the long-term and longer-awaited time of England's participation in the World Cup, in July, there was a similar model as young people, when the poppies reported an increase of 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants received even more powerful hits.
The loss of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant business in June is only deep in July.
The tastes and drinks bars, they counted the best results in their hands, compared to the low movement of restaurants.
Eating apples also suffered from the sun's time, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In the apples and barges, drinks sales dropped by 6.6 per cent per month, while food was reduced by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, of RSM’s respiratory and recreation analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we observed at the end of April.
Time and influence of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the service sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent of the annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long summer summer could not be seen at a worse time for food companies' managers and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we tested in August will bring such a desired rest."
The overall growth in the sales of apples and restaurants, including the new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the entertainment in the distribution of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyser in the country's pubs, bars and restaurants in Britain, collects and analyzes data for the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a confirmed figure in the industry.
One of five children hiding from their parents' secret profile on the social network.
One of five children – some barely 11 – has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, reveals research.
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the rise of fake Insta pages
News raised fears of publishing material with sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "principal" profile that shows their parents.
One of the five children – some of the 11 – creates a profile in a social network that keeps adults secret.
A study of 20,000 students from high school shows a rise in the fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised fears that material was published with sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "principal" profile that shows their parents and at the same time have secret profiles.
A mother who was attracted to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "inspire him".
The study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of independent schools revealed that 40 per cent of the children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, as half of them recognize that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC's director Mike Buchanan said: “It's dangerous that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Aylid Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in Borda of the Light Atlantic in Scotland.
Ilyde Doyle was elected to join the board of a medical athlete in Scotland as director without the Executive Director of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's best-performance pilot, and President Yon Byty has identified this trip as a wonderful opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from its rich international experience over the last decade.
"Eileid is delighted with great respect for the Scottish, British and world communities, and we are convinced that the smooth Atlantic in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attractiveness," Byiti said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of the athletes, and I really hope I can contribute and help to promote the sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the finals of 200 and 400 metres of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 added to his four Olympic gold medals in general, and is currently a regular commentator in BBC, losing the ability to walk after getting a transition from an ischemic approach.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show me how much I'm going to get back.
It was a great job, but I got a full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for your touching messages."
An announcement about a cream pump that compares breast-feeding mothers to who share online views
The companies producing cream pumps have shared online views with advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with breast-feeding.
In order to mark the release of the market of the expected "first silent cream pump in the world suitable for wear," Elvie’s consumer technology company released the joke music-video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump offers to the creams to show.
Four real mothers dance in a crevice, full of snow, on the background of a song with a text, including: "Yes, I come, but you don't see any hugs" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not us, these are my breasts."
The song continues: “I will blow, I will blow, I will eat the baby, I will blow, I will bring my friends."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has caused online differences.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from viewers, many claim that it reduces the "grass" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows for advertising on this product.
Like us, they should be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie cream pump collects discrepancies in the substance for creams (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “We fully understand that it is traumatic both for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why don't we still use them for a mother-fucking pump that can protect their babies?"
Another added: "That's such an inadequate advertising."
Others protected the advertising as a woman admitted that she considered the song "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is generic.
I'd buy this if I was still eating.
The shock made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little bit of a joke, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny statement directed to mothers who are ashamed (sometimes in their workplace or in the toilets) and feel like “crowds. ”
This is not a advertising that commends or condemns milk processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the women discovered that they were dancing with the discreet pumps set in their pockets.
The concept of the campaign is based on the fact that many women who steal feel like thieves.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely unspoiled, there are no holes or holes and collects discrepancies in the essence of vegetables that give women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even get out while they get out.
Anna Balarin, a partner and Executive Director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie village is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a courageous and provocative release on the market.
With the drawing of a parallel between breast milk and milked cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all the challenges related to it, while at the same time showing the incredible feeling of freedom that would bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump fell in the leading news.
During the week of fashion in London, a mother of two children appeared on the floor for designer Martha Jacobovski using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been transferred secretly to a palace camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the sharp rhetoric and policies of the Tromp administration made it difficult for children to be raised with hostages.
Most refugees are usually immigrants without documents who fear that they will risk their stay in the country if they want to know the children.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential tenants and other elderly members of the family should provide fingerprints such as these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-level immigration and militarist official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become hostages to unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal records.
"About 80 per cent of the persons who are or are hostages, or are members of the host family, live illegally in the country, most of whom are foreigners and criminals.
So we're going to keep following these people," Albens said.
In their effort to respond faster to the registration of these children, the authorities laid down new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to officials in the municipality.
Many appear in a video conference, not personally, to present their case for a legal status before an immigration court.
Those who are defined as inappropriate for authorisation will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent exits or refugee trials, according to the reception staff and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers shared that this concern grows in large arms, such as in Tornillo, where the evidence that some children have problems is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the place.
They added that moving children to “the city of Palatine ” without giving them enough time to prepare for emotional or to enjoy with their friends can be a source of satisfaction to the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria urges the US, France and Turkey's "occupationary troops" to be removed immediately
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mullam also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although civil war has lasted for eight years.
Mualem, who also assumes the position of Deputy Prime Minister-President, said that foreign soldiers are illegally living in a Syrian country in the context of combating terrorism and "they will be committed to them".
"They must be removed immediately and without any conditions," he said to the congregation.
Mualem claimed that "war against terror is near its end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been violently displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" both by terrorist organizations and by "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 military officers in Syria who mainly teach and advise both Kurds and Syrians against President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the countries left by the war.
As for the Mualem refugees, the conditions are harsh and can turn out to be, as accused “some Western countries, that they ‘ breathe unhindered fears, ’ which encourage refugees to stand out.
"We have failed the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate on these returns," he said.
"They turn into a political issue which is a completely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the restoration of Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to cease the war is reached.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major strength of the rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
We stress, however, that the agreement has a clear deadline and expressed the hope that the military actions will be directed towards the dissidents, including combatants from Al-Qaida's front of Al-Qaida's "Al Nusra", which "are yet to be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to attend the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to form a draft of the next constitution of Syria and to proceed to elections.
Mualam presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "review of the members of the present constitution" and warned that there should be no involvement.
Why Trump won't win a second mandate
According to this logic, Trump will win the election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, his presidency will not be interrupted in advance because of the impiechment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the death of the viewers right now.
From 2014 the premium rating increased by 2 to 1.05 million at CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million viewers during a prairiem, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC is on top of a cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at night with big news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, an ABC's executive producer "Last candidate", where he talks about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack against Capitolia.
Neil Scowell, who is a veteran-scanist of comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembered driving in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Skwell told me that he answered her "Because she laughed at me."
There's a party in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything that is shown on television, the history of Washington can determine the future of "Roo vs Weide", whether immigrant families can be reunited again, as well as the good condition of the world economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that can only allow the most privileged viewers.
Still, the desire to inform a citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to see how a group of experts discuss Bob Udward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Strak"; Paul Manafort's pilot's skin of a 15 000-dollar skin ("Die with complete arogentity" according to Washington Post), and the disturbing descriptions of Stromi Daniels about Mr. Trump's anatomity.
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he is doing to make you feel like part of the real show is to give you a little more every night," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, regarding the changing participants and the daily events (saving with the National Football League, complimenting Kim Chen Nu).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna stay.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, he was on the north coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he was locked up at home to see MSNBC, while he was still writing CNN.
He could not be separated from television, especially when Bret Kavano was supposed to stand before the Senate's legal commission, which depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we once made all those jokes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said in front of me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Investments are involved in the most complex transition in the early elections to a place in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money thanks to the reorganization of the congresses and from there two titles for the same place.
A recent split circle in Pittsburgh's premier mentions Connor Lamb's conservative democracy, which won its place from the other side of the partial elections last year.
Lamb is facing another titler, Republican Keith Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a significant impact on the new 17th.
The cards were re-arranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court announced in January that the old circles were anti-constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the republics.
The debate in the new 17th round has created a financial dispute between the main financial institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the NRCC.
The Lamb stands in Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by the republics for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the round with 20 points.
Political experts believe that democracy has a slight advantage.
The United States considered the imposition of sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Tromp had a heart-up meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired a management team from the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of "the recent decisions to no longer acknowledge Taiwan," said Heather Naurt, a spokesman of the Department earlier this month.
But sanctions were imposed only against El Salvador, which received about 140 million US dollars in 2017 to combat drugs, with a view to development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including the lifting of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be penalised for the Central American country with its unemployment and the percentage of murders.
In advance of the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served to continue such a gathering last year, viewed as a step forward in the efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior administrations clarified that their wish was to be a conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice-President Mike Pens said he would participate in the conference planned for the mid-October as a sign of the importance that the administration gives to the assembly, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's spokesman for the White House rejected a comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, wanted to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyser, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next step may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to the justice of Mr Trump, as the present report is a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muler is directing his investigation and whether Mr. Tromp has spoken with Russia during his campaign against our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will appear that Mr. Trump will have to be reported before this body, exactly when he is prepared to stand before the voters, as well as perhaps before the judges of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I am not suggesting that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – neither is this the case with those of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, so the West had been invaded and supported by the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We broke down and missed the opportunity to escape the years that followed.
The course of history depends on such occasions, and the infamous march of democracy is speeding up or fun.
At the moment, the Americans have been set up before a few similar attacks.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fire Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein was still in trouble since the journalist reported that last year he had proposed secretly writing to the president, and he was speculating that he was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the history of Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavano, demanded by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court in spite of the sexual harassment and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if this will force Mr. Tromp to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe we're not gonna break up because I got a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was expelled from Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the saints for Shabat on that table wearing swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, an assistant at the Brookings Institute, is the president of the "Citizens of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is an optimist for the crash with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are dominees of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Viral earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward with the G League of Europe.
Contusion in the colony did not allow Lieutenant Graham Dorans to play his first game for the season before the issue of equality 2-2 with Viral, but he believes that for Rangers this result can turn into a triumphal triumph.
"We won an important point because Villaral is a good opponent," said 31-year-old footballist.
"We entered the game with hope that we could win something and we left the point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but as a whole equality seems fair.
They were better in the first half, and we were the second.
We've taken a look at Thursday, another big night from our cats in Europe.
I hope we can fight for three points, this will be a hard fight because they have achieved a good outcome in the past meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our public we can give everything ourselves and achieve good results.
The past year has been hard after everything that happened around my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have moved in the normal direction.
The team's good, and the guys are really having fun, the exercises are useful.
I hope that we will be able to exert ourselves to forget the past season and achieve the desired success."
Women are worried about the fears of their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear picture of what care they want to receive, few people discuss it with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study share that they have discussed with their husbands the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about this.
"Hours want family members to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snaider, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life-association Action Sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t put your wishes first.
Together with your counsellor and your family discuss where and how you want to be concerned, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant may also help you with the idea of paying these costs.
Your decisions when you select a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a financial value to help you cover these costs or insurance with your means – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles in the beginning.
Appoint a healthcare professional, so that you have a certain trust that will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes, if you cannot communicate.
Think, too, of the idea of a financier on financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person who will take the financial decisions from your name and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical care and is traveling to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in writing so you can be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but about who the doctors will be," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Set up your plan."

A man was shot several times by an air gun while he was home tonight.
The victim, about 40 years old, lived in Oxford Grove, Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chests, stomachs, and hands.
The police describe the shooting that took place about 02:30 a.m. in British summer, as a "consequent act".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced that the number of dead people is expected to grow.
Due to the delayed communications, support organizations cannot obtain information from the Dongala Regent, a region north of Palu, located close to the epicenter of earthquakes with magnitude 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala that are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of a quiet beach overlooking the western coast of the island of Solavesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) across the coast of the island of Solavesi.
The Administrative Region, which is less than a province, is a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundations of the central Sulawesi province's economy, especially in the coastal region of Dongula.
Nil's acquisition is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Moroval, on the opposite side of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been picked up several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami took over the western part of Dongala and in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Thyookaan fire ring" and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and wave tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong stream of 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activates wave tsunamis that have swept 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them are in Aceh.

Sara Peelin's eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Peelin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Peelin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Paelin, a 29-year-old, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in domestic violence and against arrest, according to a report of the state police in Alaska published on Saturday.
According to a police report, when he was known by the police as a woman, he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Pailin is kept in the pre-containing building of Mat-Su and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, reported by KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “unsuspectively, with certainty” when he was asked to be imprisoned, reports the media.
Peelin is threatened with punishment for three simple classes of Class A, which means that it can be deprived of freedom for a year and pay the globe in the amount of $250,000.
He is also accused of a simple B class, which is sentenced to one day in prison and a 2,000-dollar fine.
That's not the first time you've been accused of a criminal offense against Pailin.
In December 2017 he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Peylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under review by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, involvement in the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of contagion in relation to the incident.
His friend claims he hit her with a fist in his face.
Sara Peelin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 when he associated his son's aggressive behavior with post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors want a series of death sentences for suspects in a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York want a death penalty for Saifolo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York where eight people were killed – a rare one that was not executed in the federal crime state since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, a 30-year-old, used a truck at Home Depot's house to conduct the interview on October of the bike near the West Side, in the Manhattan Valley, gas passengers and passengers on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed eight victims and has caused serious physical injuries, according to the notification of intention in connection with the death penalty in the South region, New York.
According to the court document and both charges, they may be executed by a death sentence.
Seven weeks after the investigation, an enlarged federal court body sent Saipov a 22-point indictment, including eight charges of murder, usually used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a complaint against the violence and destruction of the MPS.
The attack required "serious planning and preference", the prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov was executed as a "fashioned, cruel and disgusting".
"Sifulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused the trauma, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decad, Dan Drake, Ariel Erley, Ernan Feluchi and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the report says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since he's been looking for a death penalty for the last South region of New York.
The accused, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug addicts, but was subsequently sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in New York in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a trial for conspiracy and execution of a spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a populist, did not show a feeling of disappointment during the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about the side, says the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to make the attack, after watching the clips of the IDIL on his phone, says the prosecutor's act.
He also asked in his hospital room to set up the IDIL signal, separated from the police.
He's acting innocent by the prosecution act, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that "they are obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than take a sentence for a guilty and living prison without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatising effect of these events for all involved," said Patton.
The Saipov Protection Team previously wanted the prosecutor not to want a death sentence.
Member of Parliament of the Conservatives says NAJEL FARAJ should lead the talks for Bresit
Nigel Faraj has been called "mobilising the army of the people" today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Party of Independence said that politicians should "take pressure" – as one of the members of Tereza May's own party proposed to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a member of the Conservatives, said in March in Birmingham that the UK "has yet gone" if Mr. Faraj was a Secretary on Breszite issues.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to match the party's deeply divided order was underlined by conservatives supporting the stay that joined to a separate protest against Breszite in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise plan "Checkers", despite the attacks by the supporters of Brazil, the rest of the EU.
The Unions insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the enemy reactions and urge the Europeans and the Liberians to choose between its package and the Haosa.
Mr. Bonn said before the protestors with the logo "Exit means going out" in Solichl that he wants to "relay the Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr. Faraz had to participate equally with the others and that he had to get the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had begun, we would've left now," he said.
Wellingbrow's MEP added: "I support Breszite, but we must cover the Chequers plan.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in the world to be slaves.
We want to establish our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the claim that the public opinion had changed from the 2016 vote: "The understanding that the British have changed their opinion and they want to stay is completely untrue."
The conservators' representative Andrea Jenkins also participates in the minutes, sharing before the reporters: “I'm just saying, Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and actually helped us to be elected.
Please cut the "Chequers" and begin to listen."
In an open letter to Mrs. May, she added: “The presidents keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Faraj said at the outset that politicians should "get pressure" if they consider changing the decision taken after the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's a question of trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Breszite and we're gathered here today to say "We won't let this happen to you."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to change Brazil, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has helped us to win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters moved on to Brimingam, before they held two rounds of meetings in the city center.
The chief activists have raised flags with the inscriptions "Conservatives against Breczet", after the start of the group this weekend.
Lebster Lord Adonis is playing with the conservators on the safety of the party's application when it opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all Canada's technology and yet, to prevent the crossing of borders, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"This is a whole fascist.
There's no such thing as good Breszite," he added.
Warren said he'd "think seriously" his candidate for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "think of the opportunity to apply for president" after the November elections.
Boston Gloub reported that the representative of the democracys of Masachuzets spoke about his future during the city council in West Massachuzets on Saturday.
Warren, a standing criticism of President Donald Trump, will be applied for election in November against the state representative of the Republicans Jeff Dil, who was co-chaired by the Tromp campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
She's in the center of speculation that she can take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was the 36th meeting with voters in the building of the art after the Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for a president.
Warren said it's time for "the women to go to Washington and correct our injured government, and that includes women on top."
He's been arrested for the death of Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday, when the Vide Sims basketballist was killed by LSU.
Baton Rouge's police department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. east time.
They published a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who was seen on the frames.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Weide Sims is shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul reported before the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayed up to protect his friend and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was at the crime scene, he had a gun and he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trial and held in custody of the police administration of the East Baton Rouge community.
A youth with a rise of 6′6′′, grew up in Baton Ruj – Sims participated in 32 May with 10 departures as a titler last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 match battles.
Gran At Russia: Luis Hamilton is even closer to the world title, after the team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fetel
Also since the time Walter Botas was ranked earlier than Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play an important role in the competition.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while protecting his position in the first two courts, which gave Fetel an opportunity to attack his opponent.
Fetel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which looked like it might be decisive for the ride out of the competition.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next round and went out after Fatel, but Hamilton managed to break it after a drag and a "gum to rubber", which forced Ferrari's pilot to release the inner part of the track in order to avoid further punishment after he had already closed his opponent's route with a dangerous double protection manoeuvre on the third floor.
I took up my 21st birthday, Max Verstapen started out of the back rows of the start row and was seven after the end of the first round.
After that, he even led for a long time from the competition, since he decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the competition and possibly defeat Kimi Reaconen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered the pit stop in the 44th round, but failed to increase enough in the next eight rounds and in the final count, Raikonen finished four.
It was a hard day, since Walter did a great job all weekend and seemed like a real gentleman when he let me break it.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first two positions of inspiration," Hamilton said.
That was really a bad language on the body.
President Donald Tromp played with Senator Dayan Finstein on the rally on Saturday because of her claim that she did not spread the letter by Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano in sexual assault.
During a meeting of the Queens in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the statements given by the Forum before the Senate's Legal Commission, and instead he commented on how what happened in the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and inexhaustible".
"What can happen also is the beauty that takes place the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger when you see angry people and wicked people, and disgusting, and inexhaustible," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Fainstein, are you spreading it?
Do you remember her answer... did you leave a document-- "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not spreading."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, like a senator.
Fainstein sent the letter with details of Ford's claims against Cavano still in July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Finstein refused to do so by her office.
"I didn't cover Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Finstein told the Commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep my trust and I kept my trust as she wanted."
But her rejection was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the prosecutor for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president said that the Democrats used their claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return their authority with all possible means.
Look at the shame, shamelessness, they don't care who's gonna hurt who they're going to get over to get their power and control back," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dondy Stars 5-3 Belfast Janets
Patrick Duyer noticed two holes for Janets against Dondy.
They returned for the fifth loss in Elite League against Belfast Janets, winning the dance in Dundy with 5-3 on Saturday.
Janets was driving in a fight with two bullets after a hit by Patrick Duyer and Francis Bouvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kaunni took care of the housekeepers before Duier restored Janet's front.
France Busher is equal to Dondy before the two voices of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for Adam Kiff's boys who escaped from the bottom to win Dondi in Belfast on 2-1 p.m.
That was the fourth break between the opponents of this season, as Janets won the last three matches.
The strike with which Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFoul's assistance, and then David Ruderford doubled his advance, as an assistant to Bouvilier four minutes later.
It was the driving start, Sullivan returned the homes back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to compare with Kauni's help at 15:16.
Duyer was trying to lead Janets before the first break, pointing out a second round for the night at the end of the first half.
The housekeepers were regrouped and Bushhar re-examined the chances of a powerful blow in the door at 27:37.
Kaunnie and Charles Corcoran have worked together to help Nilsen give Dondy's front for the first time this match at the end of the second half, as he gave everything to himself and confirmed the win of the five-goal team in the middle but the last half.
Janets, who lost the last four matches of five total meetings, meets as Dominion Milton Kins for his next match on Friday.
The flight guide is dead to make sure that hundreds of people on board the plane can escape earthquakes
A flight manager in Indonesia is commended as a hero after his death, guaranteeing that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board has managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are unconscious in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Solavezi on Friday, triggering wave tsunamis.
The strong secondary storms continued to affect the area, and many were caught in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even though his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the powerful third control tower at Mutira Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed on the spot to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at that time, would be able to fly safely.
After that, he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was moving.
He died in the hospital later.
The air control speaker, Indonesia, Johannes Siritt, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives reported by ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Paul.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, after the disaster response agency in the country said access to Dongala, Siggi and Butong cities is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will grow, as many bodies are still under the ranks, and so many people cannot reach," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Vulnus, which reached six feet [6 m], left Palu, where there was a mass burial last week.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, shared before Sky News: "Every minute the line is still body.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's nightmares everywhere in the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Movement of the Red Cross in Indonesia, quoted CNN as saying: “The red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The Indonesian president, Jacques Widododo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was devastated by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aeroplane disaster in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that one person is unknown after an aircraft crash in a logon
A plane flying with a plane that broke into a lake in the Pacific now reports that one man has been declared missing, after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the flying plane.
In a press release Air Niugini said they can't contact a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airlines added that they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find a man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details for passengers, such as age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue passengers and crew, after the plane crashed into the water while trying to climb to the Chuuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airlines reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, as all were in a stable condition.
The reasons for the disaster and the exact sequence of the event remain unclear.
Both airlines and U.S. military forces announced that the plane had crashed into the legend shortly before the track.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane had passed the track.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, says the plane's gone very low.
"That's extremely nice," says Janes.
Janes says he and the others have managed to pass through the deep to cross the water to reach the emergency exits of the flying plane.
He said that the Stoards fell into panic and cried, as well as that he suffered from mild headaches.
The U.S. military forces report that seamen refurbished close to the port have also helped in the rescue action, using the expected boat to cross people to the shore before the plane falls to the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet).
The data from the Safety Aviation Network suggest that in the last two decades 111 people have been killed in planes with planes registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyzing shows the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded with her statement this week on the retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette from the U.S. Ministry of Justice gives hours of evidence as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to record the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers at night when she died.
Roulette said he got data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers by the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to ask Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and evidence that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck the same night, Sanford said "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
The phone records say they've known each other for a week.
Roulette found out that shortly after the death of Chambers Telis had deleted her text messages, calls and information about contact from her phone.
"He's left her out of his life," said Hale.
The protection plan is to start with its closing instructions on Sunday.
The court stated that it was expected that the process would be presented to the judges later that day.

The next blackout?!
A bride from New York judges a couple after a fire for a "racist" message
A bride from New York judges twice for a divorce because of discrimination after she received a wrong message from the mother who complained that she was "the next black man".
The two refuse to be racist, expressing the demand for "resurrection".
Linzi Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was laughing when she realized that the new detective, Jisel Morris, was a blacksmith when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"I don't know what it is," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and that's twice.
After she realized her mistake, the feeling was "float" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the ex-boyfriend, who was an African-American, had not done the job well and she was expecting a Philippines, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for a working day after she was sent home with a cab.
Now Morris judges the double compensation for the fire, demanding the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do that," she said before Post on Friday, adding "I'm sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racists, adding that the cessation of Morris' employment was a reasonable act, since they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they tried.
"My wife sent something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Mr. Joel Plasco in front of Post's husband.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you tried, even if it was wrong?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
Comparing the demand for “abstinence, ” Plasco says that his wife was born just two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation. ”
“Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
This is not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the case is still under review, the public opinion is quick to condemn the couple on social networks as a part of their conduct and logic.
Podington's publishers were afraid that readers would not feel any connection to the speech match, discovers a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was received from the public, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's very fun, after we know about the great success of Padington."
She explained that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before he was inspired to write the child book for a small game, would feel optimistic about the possible rejection of the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
As for Padington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family”, she added that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-appreciative," she said.
"But since Paddington felt so real, it's all one thing to have a child that has achieved something: you're proud of him, although it's not your job.
I think you've taken Paddington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he was always recording the benefits of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to meet her on the phone.
After the beating of her daughter, she was rushed to the hospital in Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors struggled to save her life.
"There has always been a call to say that the situation is really bad that does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say she's going to die in two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did to her.
I said, “Dad, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll come with you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to maintain her heart slowly stop functioning and leave her system.
She's gone a while ago, and so it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
Actually, I should've step back."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far been anxious about the loss of her daughter, falls on the plane with other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"No one understood," she shared.
"I was wearing my head, and all the time my shirts got caught.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I've felt this whole touching feeling of co-operation with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Smashing women put cards to prevent the killings from the bridge
Two women, who lost their loved ones for suicide, are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphris put on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at an age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45-year-old Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with a disgusting smile.
"Everyone knew him by the smile.
They've always said that his smile burns every room."
However, he quit his job before leaving and found himself in “the real darkness. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will have some effect."
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “to know people who have to go and who to talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Do not keep silence – you must speak.”
Mrs. Humphris, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed, or something else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his country.
He came to the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them nor looked at them."
She said that this was a terrible tragedy for them, but they had to say: “This is an empty space in the family.
We're out of here.
But we have to keep going and fight."

Bret Kavano's future is in question after the FBI starts investigating
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – a limited length and limited scope research – we could combine our efforts," Mr. Fleek said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "disappear" in spite of the party blockade.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
They're having a bad time.
The preliminary elections are only after five weeks, on 6 November – if the Republicans are expected to be well represented, they will seriously harm their attempts to be elected by their representative to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators, urging them to support Mr. Kavano, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House and with his help meet his wife, who was a personal secretary to Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI has prepared its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are present.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his application for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea "small" in Kim
A South Korean lawyer claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Nun came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, quoted by the South Korean Ministry of the Union, said there were 1127 refugees last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the stronger border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher sums required by human opponents, are the key factors.
There's no official comment from Phanyan.
Most of the refugees from the North finally receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have passed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where they find the longest border with North Korea and pass faster than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, as frequently repatriated.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month the Heads of State of the two countries met in Phenyan for talks focused on the stand in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Nun in Singapore, where they agreed on a common line they worked on the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho charged the US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"With lack of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and in these circumstances there is no first way to be held unilaterally," said Mr. Rey in front of the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavano "extended" and said he was not suitable for service in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority at Congress, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Kavano "extremely" and said he was too uneven for service in the Supreme Court .
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this week at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I wouldn't have thought that if a woman had reacted this way, they would call her "issterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness testimony of Kavano before the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the allegations that he had made a sexual visit to Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening words, Kavano was very emotional, at moments he almost cried and felt as he discussed his family and the years of his studies.
He also categorically condemned the democracies in the Commission, calling the allegations against him "a gross and coordinated attack on personality", organised by liberals, who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi noted that according to it, the witnesses of Cavano proved that he was not in a position to work in the Supreme Court, since it became clear that he was aware of the relationship of the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualified by these claims and by the way he pursues the Clinton and Democrats family," she said.
Pelosi rejected her when they asked her if she would try to discredit Kavano, if he was appointed even if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not only going to the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavano is a judge in the Appeal Court in Washington.
Pelosi added that she was concerned at the quality of the democracy in relation to Kavano's potential decisions concerning the Law on Access to Health Care or the case "Ro vs Weide" because he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano had avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a sincere, prudent man to enter the court and wait for us to say, "is it not wonderful," Pelosi concluded.
And women have to rule themselves.
It's a basic criticism, after months and years of bursting of anger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinom 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I received great help from a woman who was a executive director somewhere who shared that she cried when she was angry, but she developed her own technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she said to her neighbor, "You might think I'm sad because she cried.
I'm mad."
And then it just keeps going.
I've decided that's great."
The sentences are allowed to express anger, often because they are misunderstood at first.
One of the clearest memories I have of my previous job, in office mainly with men, is how one time while I was a bit of unexplained anger, an older woman grabbed me by the door – a smiling manager from whom I was always a little afraid – and she attracted me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be pleased that they've caused it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship with the horse called "Monkey Business", he withdrew from the contest, Mrs. Shrøder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he would not consider the idea to apply for the president himself.
"It wasn't a good idea," she said 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the contest and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation "Sneežanka and the seven Južetas".
Since she's late in the campaign, she's leaving with the collection of funds and decides she won't stay in the contest unless she can't collect $2 million.
The battle is pre-arranged to failure.
She realizes that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would just give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a break?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she claims that she will not continue with an official campaign, she is overwhelmed by so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, the discontent with the system, which makes it so difficult to collect money and be able to turn to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as to the angry against the sexist that she felt.
"Man may think I've got a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Shrøder as the media responded.
"Someone may think that Klenex are my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my grave plate?
"She's crying"?
How the US-China Trade War Can Serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were disgusting and, as the battle takes its turn, a division between the two countries will benefit Beijing in a long-term plan, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, shot the first warning wave this year, covering key elements from China's exports, including solar panels, stone and aluminium.
The biggest increase in the pressure was seen this week with the new target, which concerns production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with an effective tax burden of half of all goods imported into the United States of China.
Each time Beijing turned against a new myth with five to ten percent of American goods for $60 billion.
China has been called back on every United States attack and soon the second world economy is not expected to ignore this.
To make Washington refuse means to surrender to demands, but to surrender his head publicly before Washington will be too ashamed for Si Dzypin, China's president.
And yet, experts say, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help China's long-term plan to reduce mutual dependence on both economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political decision in Washington, as well as in Beijing, can create conditions for the economic crisis in some of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a expert on Asia-related issues to the Expert Group of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and prayers for assistance in the restoration of the country, which had been abandoned by the war, for more than seven years.
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mullam said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's position is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas left by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulalem said that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the recovery of the abandoned State.
But he stressed that there would be no provision for aid or assistance from countries financed by the rebels.
Europe won the "Rader Cup" in Paris
The European team won the "Rader Cup" for 2018 as the US's top team with final results 16.5 to 10.5 of Le Golf National" in the Paris neighbourhoods, France.
This is how the United States has six consecutive losses in the European country and has not been the "Rader Cup" in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the champion crown to the tournament, after the team led by the Danish captain Thomas Bourne reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed the victory over the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Michaelson, who was weak during most of the tournament, sent his first hit on the 16th hole (with "part") in the water with which he lost his sword against the French Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented excellently in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance 5-0-0 since the contest took place in the current form after 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost a category of 57-4 player in a European team, located at the lowest point in the Ringlingist – Torbourn Olsen from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 from Yun Poulter from England for whom this is probably the last part of the "Rader Cup".
Spanish Serhio Garcia, a veteran with eight participants in the Ryder Cup, became a European with the most successful points in the tournament for all time, as this year increased its activity to 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't hold.
It was a hard year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can lift the purchase again.
Most importantly, the team is the team and I am happy that I was able to help," shared the popular Garcia after Europe's victory.
He's giving up his cousin John Ram, who won American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on Sundays.
"I am incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, but I grew up while I watched him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four swords in France and his total balance of Ryder Cup is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the biggest players for all time have won 14 big titles – a indicator that only leaves Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was experiencing difficulties throughout the weekend, except Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed golf from high school all day in the tournament.
The U.S. team captain Jim Furrick shared after the disappointment of the team: “I'm proud of these guys, they're fighting.
Once this morning, we pressed a European election.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were very well represented.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Professional Golf Association and our "Rader Cup" Committee, and we will just look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can get your opponent's hat off.
We were just overplayed."
New for red tides: Concentrations reduce in Pinelas, Manuti and Sarasto
The latest report of the Committee on Fisheries and Wild Animals in Florida shows a major reduction in the concentrations of redfish in Tampa Bay areas.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions for slowing growth in the areas of the Pinellas, Manuti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier districts – this shows a decrease in concentrations.
Water particles with excessive colouring of red aquifers are distributed to approximately 130 miles across the coast, from the north side of Pinellas to the south side of Lee.
Waterborne participants can be seen at 10 miles from the coast of Hillsbury, but they are less than last week.
The red tide is also observed in the area of Pasco.
Over the past week, there have been reports of moderate concentrations in the coastal area or a little more in the vicinity of Pinellas, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsboro, high concentrations on the north of Manuti, high concentrations on the coast or on the north coast of Saraso, low concentrations on the vicinity of Charlotte, high concentrations on the coast or on the north of Lee, and low concentrations on the coast of Koller.
They continue to receive information about the explosions of breathing roads in the circles of Pinellas, Manuti, Sarasota, Lee and Kolier.
Last week, there were no reports of respiratory seizures in North West Florida.
