Highway traffic is dangerous!

The opposite of road traffic law.
It's a big mistake to think that it's just a problem with the high driver.
The number of accidents that occurred during the past decade (the 2015 police crash data) has resulted in more than 1080 deaths in more than 24 years and more than 1032 deaths in 75 years.
It's important that we call attention to the same level of youth, not to a lot of adults.

Well, there are people who pick different shoes by their clothes, by their hair, by their panties, by the sandals, by their clothes and by the day's clothes.
There are people who say they don't fit in driving, but they don't think they're in danger, and there are many people who drive in bad mood.

YouTuber became a very good company.
I'll listen to your boss. (bizSPA!)
9/27 (Kinn) 8:47 in a letter
YouTuber, you're the one who admires young people at the center.
It is not uncommon for companies to start using their own products, but there are companies that have started a special program called "YouTuber Uses" in their own company.
The company's company's CRM (consistency management) is the company's main business director, DmMIX.
What do you mean, "Use your Tuber"?
DmMIX is a service, and I've actually heard about Mr. Wooden, who is also responsible for the company's company staff.
I'd like to support a youth who's on YouTube.
- And what kind of program is "YouTuber"?
The wood tree (under the tree): Now, the job of YouTube is becoming a snare to many young people.
I'm sure you'll be able to get into the future job chaining, and you'll see how much more young people who're looking forward to it.
So far, I've been using a group of young people who've been following the dreams of Bandman and the funnels.
The same thing is, you're going to use young people who're looking for a dream, and you're going to help.
- There's a picture of a person doing a film on his own, like YouTube, but why did you think you could use it?
There is a fact that many young people do not have the same benefits as many young people do, called YouTube.
There are a lot of clients who create and print albums and who can't recognize the existence of their family as YouTube.
This is the current process, which provides the client with an environment for payment and content production.
I think it's going to be a very dangerous position at first, and I think it's a job demerit of NewTuber, and I think it's a way of supporting the company's efforts to support it.

The Biguyvent of Badminton, launched in August, received six medals in the 25th World Elections (Sies Barzell) that ended up in September, fighting against the Chinese OP (State/Super1000) since 17 days.
This is where the five rounds of Tokyo's next year started in May to August, but they are looking forward to the mid-SeptemberâDecember battle (Badminton Magagin's Department of Education).
The five rounds of Badminton since May have destroyed 4 summits (over Super 500) at the end of World Elections.
In the first half of the war, there will be two of them in the 4th General Assembly and two in Taiwan's surrounding districts.
The country is the world's right to choose, the rise of the Sun, and the high-point conference of the World Ranking Point, which will be held in five rounds.
It also controls JapanOP (S750).
The General Assembly has been in charge since May of the Group War (May/China), Indonesia Op (July/Result 16), Japanop (July), 4 World Elections Conference (August).
There's only a few things that are different than the other top players, and it's a schedule that's responsible for the body.
In August, only one conference of the world's electoral power would be more difficult than during the war.
The high-level conference has been expected to produce good results in the ongoing mid-term battle since September.
Ess of Taiwan, strong in the fight.
Look at Ty's young man!
There are already seven conventions in the area that have been won at the same high-level conference in Indonesia Op and the TIOP (S500).
He also fought in the local Taipei OP (S300), and he won the victory.
I'm also a hard-on-the-fly player who doesn't have any trouble fighting.
Even though the conference continues, there is no big problem with the trial forums.
On the contrary, it would have been easier to adjust the schedules of the General Assembly that would appear in the future in the early half of the war.
It was an impression of a lack of explosive power until last year, but this year it was more stable in the playing field, and it was more likely to continue.
It's going to be a better partner for a world-lanking field.
I've seen the results of the first half of the war, except for these two voters, but the young Thai youth Eers Cantafon and Si Plannis B.
And it's three players from Anders Antonsen, who fight alone as a state of Europe.
Cantafone is not going to win at the summit, and it is going to be at the best 4 this morning, as it will be at the 2nd Congress.
There's still a destructive side, but the 20-year-olds (21-year-old) who managed to match the top player, even though there's a great possibility of flying in five-year-olds.
And, Si Plannis B. went through a walk in India that's going to hit the good player in Singapore.
Samuel Barama, Plannoi H.S., and Slycans Kidamby, who are late in the day, need to be careful about the situation in India since the middle of the war.
I'm going to pay for the new cost of the cell, and I'm going to have a fair deal with the North Sea news.
"The new payment plan of the telephone company, which was implemented in July for the reform of the electronic communications business law, came out.
But I'm sorry. I'm just getting too high.
The President of the House of Commons declared that there was a "4-fold surplus" last summer, and there was no price competition, even though the expectations for the downturn were high.
It's a major reason why the original entrance to the paradise is going on, and it's going to continue to be in the middle of the three major companies.
I want you to be a more efficient money system than a fair competition for consumers.
I'd like to ask for the help of the telephone companies.
The reform law prohibits the set of end-of-ends and communications.
Instead of selling the terminals, it's becoming a high-level setup.
The software bank and the CDI(au) have announced a plan for the largest half of the terminals.
But with both companies, it's a system that's not gonna be able to use another business line for 00 days.
NTTcomo is the only contractor in the business line with the largest endpoint in three minutes."
It shows that three companies are continuing to avoid moving to other companies.
Simlock has shown how the service services will soon be required to eliminate.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The extension of the space was not achieved in the design of communications networks such as the ground station.
It's only expected that there will be an explosion of competition, but it's a good way to get rid of it.
It's not like I've had a good time seeing you.
We don't know how much time and money we've got.
I want you to take responsibility for your work as a company that handles social inflation.
This change of taxes came to an end when the President of the House of Commons made a statement.
He said, "I don't think it's going to work."
I don't think it's a good competition.
Before the company is exported from the government, it should open its own competition.
It's not easy to compare the cash system of every company.
Since the end of the sentence is making a statement that the consumer's debt is going to become the highest rate, the consumer's employer has called attention to the fact that there is a case that the consumer's debt is going to go up in half a year.
We need to focus on a clear explanation so as not to create a user's misunderstanding.
It's a three-fold cash card.
Three third-party credit banks (Sunnan-Third Bank-North Bank-North Banking Bank) announced that on 26 days, they decided to release cash-limits from cashcards to prevent the damage of special fraud.
There are three times as many people in the north-east of India who hold cash cards in all the credit institutions in the north, and over the past three years, the maximum amount of cash that can be spent on cash cards is 5 million dollars per day for those who did not have a certain amount of cash trading in the ATM (the cash automatic payment).
The Sun three revolving credit banks and the North-East India credit banks will be executed from October "and the North Credit Bank will be released from November".
There are a number of special frauds that are issued by ATMs, such as financial institutions and police stakeholders, and that they are able to keep your client's valuable loans in the best way possible.
It's just that we're on the ground floor, and we're on our way to the bottom of the ocean.

The U.S. FLKI is a Lafple, and the representative of the United Kingdom is not called "Takle."
The Japanese Congress of Lagbyverd Cape (W) was held on 26 days, and the United States, which was the last place in 20 countries, ended in England from 7 to 45.
It's a dark star, but half of all, it's called a flashlight.
It's a break in the face of the opponent's face.
The media are actually making the film out of the sea, and they're saying that they're a shameless and mean play "not to be called "Tuckles."
[scoffs] "Drive and shameful play" and the waves out of the sea!
A retreat, a moment when both military soldiers were in a state of shock... was the moment the U.S. representative of Kyle was playing on the face-to-face danger tank.
It's been a long time ago.
It's half-29 minutes after I'm at 0-38.
He broke down and broke the balance when the English lord of Farrell cut off his hair.
I went to the truck, but it was Kyle.
It's just, it's not down there, but it's up there, and it's up to half the body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are connected, and they're in a way that makes the head jump.
Farrell was hit by a storm and fell.
In fact, the English player protested that he would fly the key to a play that was obviously not fair.
The two soldiers gathered in a hurry, and suddenly the air came out.
The result of TMO (video definition) is that Kyle's on a red card.
The dog was followed by a pitch on such a bad face, but some of the audiences who asked for a faeplay were also listening.
The local media "Stuff" in Rajby's violent New Zealand is specially featured as "RaggbyW 2019: American players are back in a bad play, and England is winning."
"Kil has done a terrible shock in the face of England's Star winner Farel, and has been reported to be "a war by almost two soldiers."
The article presents a comment by the representative of England on the comment by the commentator Wago Mona.
"It's a shame, it's a shame, it's not a tacl, it's a bad play."
The U.S., which was one of the missing United States, has escaped a total of 81 minutes from the earthquake.
But Kyle's play left behind the evil after all.
On 26 September, the Ministry of Health first published a list of 424 hospital names that were identified as "no medical care" in the National Public Hospital or in a public hospital of 455.
In the FÃ¼hrer Valley, there were four hospitals in the Public and Public Hospital and four hospitals in the state hospital in the city, where the hospital was located, and four hospitals in the city were located in the city.
It's the base of the four hospitals in the reorganization.
In order to cope with the medical constraints that are so prevalent and the need to encourage reorganization of the hospital in the region.
"Even in July, I would like to ask you to reorganize the hospital, and I would like to conclude by September of the following year.
There's no force, but there's a sense of uncertainty about the absence of a nearby hospital and the return of local leaders and residents.
I published it at the same day's meeting.
The hospital was 29% of the entire hospital, and the number of beds was very small.
On the other side of the river, the river (53 to 7 %), the North Sea (48 to 6 %), the Wall (47 to 5 %), the Mountains (46 to 7 %), and the Mountains (43 to 3 %).
The number of objects is the largest 54 of the North Seas, the only zero.
On the basis of the 20-7-year-old data, in public and public hospitals, the province is investigating 455 hospitals that are able to respond to the "high-speed" general surgery.
He analyzed the need for a hospital's name, which was a medical examination of nine medical and emergency medical records, and examined whether the hospital was not in a place "in 20 minutes" in the car.
We're going to go to a hospital that's going to check out how we're going to move some of the medications to another hospital.
The medical costs will increase by 25 years of age for the entire group.
For this purpose, the province will set out the number of beds in the hospital in the country with 24,000 beds ('8' years') to reduce the number of beds in the hospital.
Now, many of the "high-speed" and "fast-speed" beds that are well-adhesive and medically well-adjusted are not enough for the seniors, and they are not enough for the seniors.
In order to respond to the rise, we need to just reduce the number of beads, and we need to increase the rehabilitary direction.
In order to reorganize the hospital, each of the tunnels will plan a "local medical design" that will take as many beds as they need for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 regions, and self-government and medical professionals agree, but many local residents and leaders are keeping their attention, and the debate is under way.
The province wants to activate the debate by publishing the name of a missing hospital.

When the fire alarm level was lifted up to 5 (protection), a shelter was opened in seven cities, and the inhabitants moved on buses and roads that were prepared for each city.

In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the farmland, the Ministry of Agriculture has published an amendment to prevent vaccines that are currently not currently approved for food.
The area of the area is the area where the infection is confirmed in the soil and in the zoonoses, and the choice of the species as well as the knowledge of the species.
The movement of vaccines and life-threatening movements is restricted in the area, but the movement of the body and of products is recognized.

When the direction is changed, the area will change the situation very carefully and decide.
The movement of the cells, the fluids, the tissues, the bodies, the discharges, is restricted to the area as a principle.
The fact is that physical and industrial products do not affect the costs of transport and farmers, which are subject to restrictions on transport.

"Why do adults laugh at their children and threaten to ask questions on Twitter?"
Mr. Greta Tonomberi, environmental activist in Sweden, who spoke on 23 September at the National Climate Action Summit in New York.
One of the points is that there's a message that's going to humiliate Mr. Gretta.
"Why do adults laugh and threaten their children?"
Political commentators said that the U.S. TV series on the U.S. TV said that it was "spiritually sick, used on both parents and international left," and that the TV agency was guilty.
In Japan, too, there is a lot of talk about Mr. Gretta on the Internet, such as "How to go to school," which is not part of Gleta's statement.
On 26 September, Mr. Greta wrote on his own Twitter, "Why do adults laugh at 10-year-olds and kids and use their time to threaten."
"I think of lies and deceptions as much as I think."
Mr. Greta said, "Well, here we start again. As you can see, people who hate me are always active, and my eyes, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm different, they're thinking about lies and deceptions as far as they can imagine."
And because adults don't want to face climate and environmental crises, they're pointing out that they seem to be confusing the point of the talk.
I don't understand why adults laugh at 10-year-olds and kids who use their time to threaten, right?
There's another good thing you can do at that time.
I think they're threatening us.
But you don't have to spend your time caring for them more than that.
The world is starting to wake up.
There's a change.
Even if adults like it, they don't like it.

I thought I'd go in half the time, but I couldn't make it, because I couldn't add it or it wasn't.
- Did you win the sixth, the seventh, Berdy?
After I hit the box at 4:00, there were 5 left, and I had to get back to the sixth grade.
At 7th, Buddy got a chance, but I regret that he didn't add to it in the afternoon.
- What did you get at this conference?
The last time we had a bad deal, we'd better get a cup of coffee in a nice cup of tea.
It was a course that would change direction and direction in the barbara, and it's not very much.
- What's the difference between the General Assembly?
(Laughter)
I didn't want to worry about it, but the way the gallery was filmed.
It was not very different from that, but it was a very small conference of Japanese voters in the community, and it was a bit like, "We're not going to lose our foreign players."
I want to win one victory for no more than one in the last half of the war, and I want to win one if I don't win more than one, and I want to win one.
What's the way to prevent recognition from becoming a "forgetable"?
I'll take the material. I'll take it.
A major drug company and university hospital have been diagnosed with congenital cancer.
But we know that the relationship between recognition and living habits is explained, and we know that it is possible to remain in a state of great misery and to remain in a state of forgetfulness.
I've heard of professor of brain cancer at the University Hospital, the center of brain cancer.
I don't have to admit it.
- I'm looking forward to some treatment, but what's going on?
There's a possibility that you will be able to recognize that everyone is pregnant.
But it's thought that the development of new recognition drugs will take more than 20 years.
The drugs that are widely used in Japan are already out of insurance in a country outside the sea and cannot be expected to have an adverse impact on control.
On the other hand, deaths from infections and accidents have decreased, and deaths have been reduced in various stages of treatment such as cancer, and people have become able to live longer.
It's also the fact that there's a growing number of recognized patients.
It's not just that we can solve ourselves and our families, but that we need to build a secure and secure environment in the area as a whole.
How to keep the "forget" level.
- I'm sure there's someone who's good enough to be conscious, and someone who's good.
Even if it's not possible to avoid a major recognition, it's possible to keep the symptoms as long as possible and to keep them as "forgotten."
It's considered to be one of the most common diseases in the world.
First of all, Metabos people tend to be conscious.
It's just that it's a disease of consciousness that's taken as one of the most common diseases in life.
It's full, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol.
It's going to have nothing to do with the economy.
For example, in the United States, there are areas that share food chains in the poor area, but food chains are also available in the food chain, which can be stored in the refrigerators, pizzas, and cookies.
We can't use gas or electricity, and we can use people who live in an environment that can't be eaten.
And then we're going to get a lot of food, and then we're going to get a little bit of food, and we're going to live a different life.
In time, poverty will get worse, and if you do, you'll see TV more than you can do, and your body will be free.
We're going to have a situation like this in Japan.
And the other person, who doesn't think about things, and who doesn't work, has a good attitude to be aware of.
To prevent recognition, we need to read books and think about things from day to day.
