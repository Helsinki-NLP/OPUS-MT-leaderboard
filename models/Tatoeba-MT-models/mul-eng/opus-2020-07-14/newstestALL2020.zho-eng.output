On 27 days, during the match with the girls of the Netherlands, the Chinese army was returned to a city in the event of two victories, finally at 3:1 P.N. and arrived at nine.
The World Cup is nearing its end, although the guards are waiting, the Chinese women's performance in the face of the Serbian army cannot be slowed down.
The Chinese women's ranks were as strong as before the Netherlands's two fronts, and the two fronts were broken up by 25.19, 25.25.16, respectively, until the third stage.
The Dutch women's ranks have strengthened the aggressiveness of the ball, the Chinese team has been attacked, the additional girls have been attacked, and the failure has begun to increase, and finally 21:25 has been returned to a city.
On receipt of the interview, the follow-up team also stated: " Third grade, because we failed to send about eight minutes. "
Of course, the Dutch women's performance was not easy, and even before the Chinese women's race, it was difficult to prepare, although it was lost, but everything was still in hand, "and the force was normal, and the five were normal, so we told the team to focus on "The Chinese balance said this.
Fourth, the team is actively adapting the situation, which is usually in full control of the attack fire, which is eight minutes from the unit, and which is a great deal to win for the team.
To date, only two rounds of the 11 rounds have been left, although a Chinese woman's rank has touched the champion's prize, but it has actually fired a warning to Chinese women in the game against the Dutch team: the more critical time it is, the more effort it takes to win.
In another 27-day match, the Russian and American women's ranks were five, and the United States team had not been able to take all three of them from their hands, so that China's women's ranks had only received three-thirds of the anti-Serbia games and could be achieved in advance.
All kinds of situations are facing the development of women in China.
However, despite the fact that the Serbian forces are the sixth largest in power, this does not mean that they will be sent to China three times as easily as possible.
From the current composite form, the Serbian forces have already had a basically no prize, meaning that they can " stand up " in the race against China's women " , put down their boots to fight against all the forces, and the Chinese forces will be able to stand up against the pressure.
In addition, the alternate Serbian team is not a "man-to-face" sheep, which, in the past with the Dutch team, has been the 5 sides of the battle, and the two of Serbia's finals have turned the total sovereignty of the Netherlands into a depth of its position.
Before the third phase of the game, the team also showed that the two of us would not like to respond: "The big game would be very difficult, and we would be as long as we were, seriously prepared."
Now the guard's horn is broken, and the game really has entered the whitening phase.
According to the fact that Chinese women's ranks are on the counter, only the final key is to be closed, and to see whether girls' ranks can play a normal level and at all levels of independence in the race.

The majority of the remaining 100 disabled persons involved in this activity were the first to enter the post.
The 56-year-old syllable was just a dead man, and it was not possible for both of them to go out at the same time.
He said: "The first time I sat in the postroom today, I'd like to take a long walk away from the bonfires, feel a deep breath of breath, and feel a lot of excitement, and it's hard to forget."
The volunteers from the Centre for Urban Welfare and the Blue Day Relief Team provided detailed and short-term services for disabled persons.

The Republic will come to celebrate the '70s, the flashlights on the streets, the many images that we don't remember very well, the flashlights — they are, for our bright days, the heat of St. Louis and the source of the light...
However, if the hero goes along, it looks like you're just like me.
The main scientists in the Middle East, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the one-time, the only thing to do in the deep mountains of the state, and there are no two things to do; the Sun, the Red, a dark village boy, to go to the West, to the West, to learn to read about the heart, to laugh, to laugh, to laugh, to laugh, and laugh; the Red, the movie artist, over 90, and for the high-seven hours of the day, and also wants to play in the "flag" ...
They are the ones who are merciful, the virtuous, the virtuous, and the virtuous; and it is easy for them to be raised up in what they do not know, and not in the love of wealth, nor in the love of wealth.
It's like a treasure hunt, but it's amazing, unsatisfied, and unsatisfied, and unsatisfied.
Every "twisted sheep ", every baby's heart, behind every one of my own family.
The family is concerned not only with the faces of the hero but also with the hearts of millions of people.
Once, when a student of a woman was turned crazy by a friend of the Internet, "When a hero was gone, someone always sat on the street and I didn't want to be a hero, and I wanted to be the one sitting on the street."
In fact, when the hero and the hero cry, it doesn't matter.
The people on the road are also sending heat and light, and they're shining their bodies.
Just like you, there's always some machines in your life, there's a few moments, there's a day that's full of months, and it's like a hero.
At the annual meeting, the Chief Justice of the Sea, Hughwa, was rehabilitated with the judicial reform, and the teacher of the Sentamento, who had published his own story for a year, issued a letter of paper, without any mistake, " doing simple things is not easy " , and the Chiefs of the Huangwa Rates would send a voice to this "tack."
It's an insult between a hero and a hero calling another hero.
There's a cave in the village of the village, there's a pool of water in the valley, there's a " heaven" in Southeast Asia, there's a dance, there's a forum... to be a hero, not to rely on his own efforts, to have a better environment and to encourage the mechanism.
For example, "China's eyes " now seems to be one of the lies.
In the 1990s, China's scientific technology was still in trouble, and the little writer of mercy had not written " three " .
At that time, the most cow's eye was the single-line radio telescope in the Puerto Rico Islands of America — Aresbo, 350 meters straight, considered to be the world's most "inexhaustible."
China's radio remote at that time, not just one of the people.
In Japan, however, the world's scientific conditions and wage water continue to come back, bringing back a rather crazy idea: the construction of a new generation of " large-scale telescopes " in China, receiving more news from outer space!
China's hundreds of dollars, and the big money is playing stars?
The mother country trusts South East, the "heavenly Eye" project opening.
The address was used for 12 years, and the position fell to 9 years.
In 500 meters, the sky's eye was opened, and China became the first example of the world's unique scientific engineering.
So, "God's eye" is amazing, the South East is amazing, it's amazing, it's amazing, it's a big, high-performance republic.
There's confidence in the country, the good will of the people, the right of the South East, and the mechanism to become the hero of the souls of the people of the country.
There are young people, white heroes, and people in the streets are very quiet, and such a country is beautiful and beautiful.
The top of the garbage class is into the Gillin childhood garden, and the environmental concept is taken away from the well.
On 27 days, a small children's education school in Gilin, Jillin, was held to teach children to collect trash and other types of trash.
It was reported that this was the first time to enter the local school for child education.
In the past, the nine-part segment of the province of Gilin was jointly launched " Programme of work for the promotion of urban waste classification " .
In 2019, based on a test for the mandatory classification of waste in the long-term city, the province decided to carry out life-class work in the rural cities.
Jillin is one of them.
We hope that through this event, we will achieve the effect of raising families with young children, encouraging communities and promoting environmental protection.
The event was organized by H.A., in the implementation of the International Park for Young People's Children.
That day, the mayor read the Environmental Initiative, hoping that the garbage group would make it from the child.
After the "low carbon bee" dance, the children group formed an empty-class small game.
The guide also issued a "recoverable "other trash" label, recommending that the children go home to the trash and record a small video.
The young child's garden has always promoted low-carbon, green environments, and a constant opening of an environmental conference.
In the field, the garbage investment facility also set up a category of garbage dumps, and the category of investment is marked on the top.
Teachers, what are the children to take back the trash?

After many years of effort, the city's municipalities have the ability to treat life-threatening waste.
In the programme of work for promoting urban waste classification in the province of Gilin, it is clear that it calls for deep involvement in trash classification fields, educational materials, schools, by creating trash categories, songs, comics, micro-videos, by strengthening the interaction between students and parents, to achieve the effect of "Education of a child, influence a family, promote a community and develop a new generation of people".

Hilack's death. Political legacy.
On 26 days of the local time, the former French President, Hilack, lived at 86 years of age.
In a world where there is no big change in the century, the many political heritage left by this French politician during the reign of that year is still worthy of our tribute.
Hilak has served as President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He has inherited a diplomatic spirit of independence from the Communists, and he strongly supports the integration of Europe, as well as the pursuit of the "European dream" by the people.
At the same time, he was a strategically visible politician who strongly promoted the multilateralization and multilateralism of the world.
For that reason, the French media assessed him as " the excellent representative of France at the world stage " .
Hilak is one of the political decisions of the Zizonora, which is against the war of the United States.
Under his leadership, France's arm held up the US pressure and went to the front line of the war.
After a year of the outbreak of the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would increase terrorist activity and make the world more dangerous.
The following facts prove that Hyrac's warning is true.
In the context of European integration, the United States' unilateralism is becoming increasingly evident, and today there is no doubt a strong signal for Greece's strategic thinking and choices in international political and global affairs.
Hilak is also one of the most famous and beloved French politicians in China.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the Golden Decade, which was first elected President of France in 1995, and promoted the rapid development of the relationship between law in the strategic perspective of politicians.
In 2004, the Central Law established a comprehensive strategic partnership, which led to the entry into the entire new phase of the Middle Law bilaterally.
During the Hilak regime, the bilateral trade rate in the two countries of Central France grew rapidly, and cooperation in many areas such as aviation, nuclear power and rail transport has progressed.
The Year of Culture of Central Law Initiatives created a whole new culture exchange model in the history of Central France.
Hilak's life is particularly impressive about China's culture.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Hilak was able to turn to the White, some of the ruins of Dui, and even to identify the history of the Chinese foundry.
"Not seeing the gold court doesn't really go to Egypt, nor does it really go to China" — this sentence comes from Hilak.
Hilak had responded to a press conference with the New York Times: " Western political and social development in China, the ecological problems arising from economic growth in China and the political status of China at international level.
But I personally trusted China.
I believe that China is a country with long-term civilizations, whose experience is sufficient to help it create ideas and values for achieving and developing and to take on its responsibilities on a long-term basis at the world stage. "
I also believe that China's restoration will bring new creative power to the world culture and rich world culture.
Sman has gone, but Hilak has left the political legacy of the world and announced that he will live with the generation.
On the 27th of the seventh "Special Meeting of the Chinese Computers' Academy of Data Sciences" on the "Special Meeting of the People's Computers" on the subject of the "Science of the Future" on the screen, experts and industrial leaders in the field of mass data research focusing on the issues of the great data point of study and understanding the technical process in the age of human intelligence.

The Hong Kong Regional Legislative Office will develop parliamentarians against the U.S. Port Act
On 27 days, the members of the Parliament of the Hong Kong Legislative Assembly issued a statement in which they strongly object to the adoption of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act by the United States Chambers of the General Assembly.
This statement by 40 MEPs of the Union shows that the rights currently enjoyed by Hong Kong are guaranteed by the basic law of the Hong Kong region, including the maintenance of free trade ports and the status of unique customs zones, in economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sport, in different areas, in order to conclude and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements on the name of Hong Kong, with international and regional trade, cooperation and development relations.
These rights are not granted by any foreign Government or legislative body.
Since long ago, Hong Kong has been firmly committed to international agreements, international rules, laws and business morality, and to engage in cooperation with different countries and regions in many relevant fields, and has been successful and transparent.
It was stated that it was not necessary for the United States Board of Governors to act on the motion of the relevant legislation to respond to the call by its representatives in Hong Kong, as a means of grave interference in internal affairs in Hong Kong and for its representatives to obtain political funding in Hong Kong.
The construction of parliamentarians is deeply sorry for the United States Assembly and strongly opposed.
The declaration stated that Hong Kong was an important trading partner in the United States and the largest trading venue.
The good rule of law in Hong Kong, a fair and free business environment, a clean society that makes it a good choice for American businessmen.
In addition to fighting the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, the United States, as adopted by this bill, will add to the snow, with no benefit and no loss of life.
The declaration stated that Hong Kong would continue to enjoy the rights conferred on it by the basic law and effectively fulfil its obligations, as it had been, without undue delay.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international community and international trade.
According to the "European Time Report" 26, the French Parliament's two weeks later will discuss immigration policy reform.
France's President McDonald said that he was unable to " accept everyone " , but also to work " well " to accept " .
It is reported that Makron tried to find a way through a breach in immigration affairs and to slow down the upcoming debate.
In recent days, in New York, Macedonia has been invited to participate in the general debate during the general debate in the United States, and it is hoped that there will be a genuine "double" programme in migration policy to find a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said: " If France wishes to be able to properly accept (immigrants), it will not accept everyone " .
The four focusses on immigration policies are on the swift delivery of asylum qualifications to refugees in need of protection; better promotion of immigration integration; acceptance and protection of all migrants entering the French territory; and more effective re-establishment of illegal entry into France.
Whether illegal migrants should be protected by the National Health Assistance System (AME) is the most topic discussed in the previous context.
He expressed his hope that this system would be "assessed" but not to remove it but to impose a certain limit on it.
After this statement was made by the Macedonians, the leader of the " National Union" directly sent a statement that the expression " empty words " was made by the Macedonians.
Members of the right-wing community, President of the Senate, Lacher, also said that migration policies should be discussed in the form of "meaning and "actual" and criticism of Makron.
The members of the left social party, Valo, believe that France should " accept more and better " and criticize the topic of Macedonia " in the "fucking" issue.
It was reported that the new version of "Loving and Immigration Law" had been promulgated for a year, leading to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but it was also not safe for the right to join the opposition.
In the next general election in 2022, the issue of immigration policy will again become a very direct attack, and Macedonia needs to have a role to play in this issue, but it will also increase the risk of hate among left-hand people in the political parties.
It was reported that the French National Parliamentary Subcommittee would hold a debate on immigration policy on 30 September and that the Senate would hold a debate on 2 October.
There are signs that China A is arriving at " repurchasing " , and many on-the-spot companies are taking stock of "Minjaban bank" repurchasing companies.

In this regard, the Board of Directors of Directors of the Markets of the share A shares of this year expressed the limited responsibility of the Board of Directors of the MIC and expressed the low value of the entire market, with relatively low prices for the repurchasing of purchases, which contributed to the efficiency of the use of the funds of the above-market companies, and also demonstrated the willingness of the company to manage the market value and the rich cash flow, which contributed to the confidence of investors.
In addition, an ongoing improved system of repurchasing has also contributed to the active conduct of the repurchasing of shares in the above-mentioned companies.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the rules for the repurchasing of the purchase shares of the above-mentioned companies were issued by the ITC and the ITC and provided detailed rules and instructions for the ITC.

Of these, the primary items are the Ilya shares, which are reimbursed for $50 million.
What impact will the market have on the market on the acquisition of the shares in the market?

The former were established in good business performance of the company, and the latter demanded higher quality of the company and its control unit.
For the capital market, this is the core element.
The acquisition of shares in the market is beneficial to the investor's confidence and has a significant impact on the price of shares in the company's shares.
In addition, the East Banking Survey estimates that, according to the estimated total purchases of shares in the market company A since the beginning of this year, and that the recapitalisation of the recapitalisation of the shares is expected to exceed $15 billion this year's increase in the amount of the A shares market.
In the next two months, the National Center for Textual Security will be reopened during this year's year.

On 26 September, members of the State and the Secretary-General took the lead at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, China and the Foreign Council members of Africa.
Tano, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Côte d ' Ivoire, Ojono, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Minister of Foreign Affairs of South Africa, and Foreign Affairs of Niger, member of the Council of Africa, attended the meeting.
The Queen made four recommendations on strengthening cooperation between the two Central Africans in the Council.
First, force out of force.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, which is directly the challenge of fundamental norms of international relations, the role of the United Nations being attacked, and the interests of large developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To deal with this challenge, it takes Central African hands, arms and arms, and unity is powerful.
In the Council, three African countries spoke with a voice, and the summaries were not just three votes, but the entire continent of Africa.
China and Africa are together, not just four votes, but will lead other countries to join, affect and consolidate the Council ' s agenda.
Since 2018, China and members of the Council have established a "3+1" coordination mechanism to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, by consultation.
The Middle East has always promoted political solutions to hotspots, the good tradition of Africa ' s consultations and the successful experiences of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many complex issues on the Council's agenda, especially the hot spots in Africa, are largely the root causes of colonialism, which are directly related to external factors.
We would like to use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play a good role in the well-being and mediation of the United Nations.
Thirdly, I think I'm strong.
African countries and peoples know the problems of Africa best, and Africa has the ability to solve its own problems wisely.
When addressing the hot spots of Africa, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa, play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support the internal solutions from Africa.
The Middle East would like to strengthen coordination with non-Arabs and to strengthen its capacity to advance African peace operations.
Fourth, based on development.
China and large African countries are developing countries, and we need to continue to put economic and social development first and support the ways of development of each other.
The Middle East wishes to build a " one-way " agenda with the African Union " 2063 " , the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda of 2030, the African Development Strategy, and to help African countries strengthen development capacity to eradicate the causes of conflict.
We would like to encourage the United Nations to increase its contribution to Africa's development together.
The situation in the Congo (Kin) is again worsening, and the Middle East will continue to fully support, provide the strength and humanitarian assistance, and will be able to coordinate with African countries, to mobilize greater assistance, such as the United Nations, WHO, and to play a good role in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Congo (Gin).
Rehabilitation like the new generation of children.
Surprise!
A 32 - week - old baby can't be born on his father's sidecar on the way to the hospital.
Luckily, the Eminence Section and the New Child Doctor have been treated in a timely manner and have been able to return to this little life.
Interestingly, on 19th, on 21st day, three children born on the road were born in 120 emergency vehicles and 29 weeks of early births in 29 days.
She was a second-born mother, at 7:00 a.m. on 19 September, thinking that she was pregnant for 32 weeks, and the first child was an early child, and she picked up the product and prepared to wash herself straight to the hospital.
After 9 p.m., Ms. G.A. picked up enough to let her husband drive the car out of the East house to the hospital.

After 20 minutes, Ms. and the baby finally arrived at the Women's Women's Women's Hospital in the North Pacific.
The hospital security found that the couple and little baby were injured and immediately informed her of the fact that four doctors and assistants were taking their bags and bags to the floor.
"At that time, half the mother was lying on the sidecar, under the water and blood, and a boy was next to it, and with a knife."
He was asked to know that the baby was a 32-week-old child, whose parents were not able to cover their children's bags. The morning of the first day, he had a desire to warm up his skin, without crying, and four-year-olds.
The nurse quickly went to the baby’s breast-feeding nurse, and quickly opened the baby’s bag, and with the treatment and mother’s package in it, the baby’s mouth was filled with several levels of heat and the new baby’s respiratory tract (such as map) and then carried it on to the baby’s 12 new child’s bed.
Upon learning of the news, a new pedagogical doctor rushed to the nurse station and rescued the newborn baby.
At the time, the baby had a red color, and there was a lack of oxygen, and the doctor immediately gave him air conditioning, not for a minute, the baby was re-heated, and the skin was gradually red, and it was successful.
After entering the hospital, this 32-week baby had a respirator, a continuous recovery, a quiet breathing, and the next day it was successful.
After one week of treatment, the baby's life is now stable, breathing, and it's starting to eat a little milk.
Interestingly, on the 19th and 21st of the 21st days, three children born on the streets were born on the road, and two were born on the 120th emergency car, both of which were 29 weeks old, and currently actively cured in the new Child Section.
The Director of the Women ' s Hospital for Women ' s Health has emphasized that in recent years, female babies have been born on the ground and the baby in their private car, which is unlikely to threaten the mother ' s safety.
The director reminded me that when my mother was in pain, she was in a coma, and she saw a red phenomenon, she should be in the hospital right away.
If you are pregnant in your home or on the street, the mother should be at the highest level, and the child should be treated as soon as possible.

Trudo's "man's crashing." Can he still make a connection?
This time, Trudo's one of the "big holes" on his head, it's a little bit out of Trudo himself.
In recent days, Canadian media have linked a number of old photos of current Prime Minister Trudeau, who will make it a black picture.
This has been considered a manifest racial discrimination that has recently led to a massive wave of riots in Canada.
After the incident, Trudo repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, the Canadian population is not able to buy accounts.
Trudo just moved his feet.
As stated by the political commentators, such as the Leley family, since the rise of the " Black Face Movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Free Party have consistently charged the opposition party or the party with holding an opinion in this regard " , and several times the declaration " should be removed immediately from anyone who made this mistake " .
Simplely, this time, Trudo's going out with one of his head "guests," it's a little bit out of Trudo himself.
Trudo was the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young Englishman who had set up a "political image" on his way.
He was originally the "political figure" who, following the leadership of the Federal Free Party Party, fought a beautiful milestone in the 2015 federal legislative elections of Canada — the Federal Free Party's over half of its parliaments in the Federal Chamber.
At the same time, Trudeau introduced a wide range of sensitivities, such as " Ecological and gender equality " , " economic revolution " , emphasising corruption and " unfair winds " .
For five years, however, he has been in charge of nearly all of the above-mentioned proverbs, " high-fashioned down " .
With regard to ethnicity and gender equality, he did not address this "black face" incident, which he had previously done in a series of indigenous issues, and led the indigenous group to move the protest to the front door of the National Assembly in the day of the 150th anniversary of the construction of Canada.
At the beginning of the last year, Trudo was involved in the famous "Landian Flying Events" in the area of corruption.
It was dismissed and the construction company Lajun was seriously infringed with the private fraud case, pressureing the department and officials responsible for the investigation and demanding that the latter be " high-quality " .
In addition, Trudeau was angry with the officials who were angry at the disclosure of the case — the Queen Dei, mentioned in the preceding article, who was the prosecutor-general of Canada when the case was handled directly.
Despite the fact that the case itself is suspicious, it is difficult to wash.
Many observers pointed out that the five-year-old government of Trudeau had broken down, mainly by its own "stupid" and that the largest "smoker" was more than "stupid" and "study" than "study" by itself.
The most powerful English-Raddian population data from Canada showed that from 2015 onwards, the number of tourists in Trudo in support of 60 per cent has declined from one route to 30 per cent, and the opposition has never increased from 30 per cent to 60 per cent.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have shown the same bad, even though a relatively small part of the party's voters still want to vote for the Federal Free Party, they are still not concerned about this federal Prime Minister.
On 21 October, a new Canadian federal legislative election was about to begin, and would Trudo be able to replay the whole drama that won five years ago?
The answer may be just one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of business competition, the level of consumer experience, or from the integration of regional aviation, and the level of integration of Kinzin development, have a far-reaching and positive impact.
On 25 September, the Beijing International Airport was officially operating.
Newspapers from Beijing were informed that the capital airport was in a state of emergency and operation and that the launch of the international airport would increase the capacity of the capital air services.
Following the sea, Beijing became the city of the second city with two airports in my country, which served mainly in domestic aviation with the International Airport of the Upper Sea, and the Prussian airport was the same as the future capital airports and the major airports would provide more detailed services in terms of the differentialization of domestic and international operations.
For the sake of operational development, large-scale airports have a more beneficial impact on the capital airports.
In 2018, the number of passengers in the capital airport was broken down by 10,000, while the country's capital, while the operational needs for rapid growth, remained apparent, especially the gap in international aviation needs.
In order to improve domestic travel, differentiated needs, to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open urban development trends with international approaches, the largest international airport is located as a major international airport, and plans to meet the estimated annual passenger consumption of 10 million tons.
Therefore, both airports are free of charge, and there are sufficient market space for different customers, depending on different groups.
From the economic level, the international airport’s current traffic will clearly have a dual impact, reducing the tension in Beijing, speeding up passengers and freight flows, and building up the growth of the capital's dual-nuclear operations.
From a user point of view, the future does not have to focus on the major international airports, but it can also reduce a series of problems that have resulted from over-focused airports, such as the extension of the station security time, the slow pace of travel of passengers, the indirect increase of aircraft and passengers in the time of the airport, the increased burden on the operation of the airport, and the reduction of traffic by the capital airport, which has also improved the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media, the time and cost of travel to large international airports, such as the launch of a high-speed highway from the South Five, can be reached by 50 minutes, the cost of money coming back to around 40 dollars and 15 dollars; and the choice of a road-based train-based airport, with a distance of 20 km, 30 km, with a price of $10,25 and 35 dollars; citizens can also travel to Beijing City, leaving only 20 minutes from the train station.
In general, citizens have a number of transport tools available at large airports, and costs and time are also within a more reasonable range.
From the trendal development point: The location of the major airport is a new turnout, so far away from Beijing City, but it has strengthened the north of the river, and it has made it easier for more people to drive, which is important to the northern of the Ra'ad River and the economic development of the Saxin region.
In the future, in the north of the river, Pacific passengers can enjoy the more international airway services provided by the major international airports, which can be seen from the traffic planning of the major airports.
In addition to the new airport in Beijing, there are several high-speed airfields and surrounding areas.
This is similar to the East Coast, Mount Fuhr, and the far-citizens can travel through Frankfurt, as well as the extensive high-speed road to the White Sea Airport, and the inhabitants of the New York area will also benefit from a large-scale airport with access to fast-efficient air services.
It can therefore be seen that large international airports have not only increased several routes and several aircraft, whether from the business level, the consumer level, or from regional aviation integration, and the development of the Kimsinian integration area, have a far-reaching and positive impact, not only on the long-distance and development of the Beijing aviation industry, but also on the development of a variety of options for the implementation of the Beijing-wide population, and to further improve the quality of the Beijing aviation service, and to facilitate the integration of the Kisinian process, and to facilitate the development of ICTs in the surrounding areas of the major airports.
As a result, for the travel of large-scale airports, we need to account for more than a small account of the individual and a larger account of the overall development.
27 days averaged 1.46 per cent - New-Water Network
On 27 September, the New York Society launched a high-level panel of 27 September, finalizing 6077.23 points, 87.55 p.m. and 1.46 per cent on the previous transaction day.
On that day, the average panel was $10.8 billion, with a decrease of $319 million on the previous trading day.
In the middle of the trading day, there were only 668 units, 15 units, and only 222 units, 4 units, and 40 units, respectively.
The Economic and Social Forum of Viet Nam, 2019, held in the governorate of Guernsey
The Vice-President of the Economic Commission for the Union of Viet Nam made it clear that, at the beginning of this year, there were many new developments in the economic development of Viet Nam and continued to continue to grow.
The Forum focused on economic socio-economic issues that had been highlighted several months before 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, the representative of the Forum discussed the impact of the 2019 Economic Development and some of the Trade Agreements, some of the issues highlighted in the 2019 Vietnamese economy, the issues highlighted in the culture of Vietnam in 2019, and four topics of profound exchange of views and views on the projections and recommendations of the 2020 Vietnam Economic and Social Development.
Representatives generally believe that global economic growth slows down in the first few months of 2019 and increases in risks and challenges.
Trade flows among large economies have further reduced global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that, despite the uncertainty of the global economy, 70 per cent of the global economy is in decline, there are still many positive achievements in the development of the Vietnamese economy, macro-economic stability, effective control of inflation, an average increase of 2.64 per cent in the last half of 2019 and a minimum increase in three years.
Although GDP growth in the last half of 2019 was 6.76 per cent, although 7.05 per cent of the same year, the increase remained a higher level compared to the same level of the 2011-2017 period.
In forecasting the trend towards economic development in Viet Nam in 2019-2020, the Vice-President of the National Economic and Social Prediction Centre for Viet Nam stated that, in the context of the global economic turmoil, the economy was experiencing a higher rise in Vietnam in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Viet Nam's macroeconomic economy will continue to maintain fundamental stability, and the implementation of self-trade agreements will contribute to trade development, economic structural adjustment, the improvement of the business environment, and the impact of trade fraud on the export activities of Viet Nam will result in a downward trend.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the monitoring of early warning mechanisms, to seek trade relief measures for export goods in Viet Nam, to explore opportunities for expanding the new export markets, and to facilitate exports of such products as agricultural products.
At the same time, inflation rates will be controlled at a reasonable level, thereby contributing to the development of industry and support for the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecosystems.
On 26 June, the head of the Office of the Conciliation Council of the Embassy of China in Cambodia, J.J., held a meeting in Zhaoq, celebrates the establishment of the new China for the 70th anniversary.
For 70 years, New China has been active in international affairs, and China has contributed to the promotion of global economic governance, the promotion of more Chinese wisdom and China's programmes for world peace and development, as well as to the real benefits of economic development and civil well-being in Cambodia.
As the world's second largest economy, China's contribution to world economic growth is over 30 per cent, especially China's "one-way" initiative, and China's cooperation between the provinces of the provinces of China and the provinces of the province and the province continues to deepen.
He said that this year was the year when the 61-year-old construction of China was opened, and two countries had brotherly affection, and cooperation would be a force for local economic and social development.
Disseha, governor of the province of Zhao-Qaida, highly praised the great achievements of the new China in 70 years, and welcomed the results of good cooperation between the two countries in China.
Dissehar expects both sides to continue to promote friendship and cooperation in the Middle East, to strengthen mutual trust and to continue to improve the standard of living of peoples.
Disseha said that he had a friendly relationship with China's municipalities, and that he had a close relationship with China's 28 provincial cities, a major cultural project "Migrating" and "King of Korea", a new international airport project, a training course for government officials, a student's academics, village halls, and the reform of the urban road, and the reconnaisssance of public benefits projects "lighting", and that he became a direct beneficiary in his friendly cooperation with the people of Cambodia.
The Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Keninson, President of the Council of the Province of Chiang Mai, Governor of the province of five provinces, the Council of Kawawa, the Volunteers, the Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, the representatives of medium-sized enterprises and the representatives of the Foreign Affairs Mission.
"The New War Network" was born in the 10th year of China's witnessing town.
If the local website forum for 2009 is the starting point, the 2019 Wings Conference, held in San Juan, has been held for the entire decade.
From a concept of "individual" to "individual" practice, data are estimated to be one of the core techniques of public service in China's economic development, social management and economic development within 10 years.
In the midst of a new energy pumping car located in the Red Sea, there was more than a new " colleague" with the latest inspector's body.
It is 24 hours of rest, not knowing the speed is more than twice the rate of human labor, and the accuracy of quality checks is more than 95 per cent stable.
According to the company’s manager, this photo-based "quality inspector" has focused on more than 40,000 film-based illustrations, which are based on the background computer, which can quickly transform the raw image into bilingual languages, which will be placed in the electronic category.
This enterprise is just a summary of today's manufacturing capacity transition.
The Ministry of Industry and Information has issued a " Guide to Promoting Entrepreneurship on Enterprises (2018-2020) " , which was presented by the Ministry of Industry and Information, by 2020, in an effort to achieve a clear and positive increase in corporate awareness and activity, and a significant increase in the proportion and application of the above.
The King of the Aristobian, he strongly stated that today the data center's calculations have built a bridge for the digital economy of the data as a key element.
At the same time, my country's GDP is increasing over the next 10 years.
The " White Paper for Development (2019) published by the Institute for Information Communications of China in July this year shows that China's GDP in 2018 is estimated at $96.8 million, with an increase of 39.2 per cent in 2017.
In addition to being an industrial transition, the key technologies for digital economic development have not seen the unmet "study" change in urban management and social life in ignorance.
At the Spring Conference this year, the "Chief of the City" that continues to shine for three years remains a source of concern.
As indicated by Arijun, the current capital of the city has become a barrier to urban management from the traffic governance tool and the related cooperation application has been extended to 23 cities worldwide.
Through the headset of the film, the computer of human wisdom, the city brain, through a strong computing capacity, enables the new urban management services, such as " road design " and " road design, " to be able to achieve the function of " pre-retirement " .
In the field of government services, it has been easier to calculate the supply of government services to two branches, using a " one-off" to pick up " one " thing " , to get the "hand" of the office " and to proceed with the "hand" of the "hand" and "hand" of the "hand" of the "hand" of the office.
At present, a united public data platform has been built throughout the province through the government.
As of 11 September, the platform had already covered over 57 million regular population and more than 15 million legal units in the province, collecting data from the Government of 3066,190,8 million.
The average monthly shift between the government departments of the province, the share of the data has reached 12 million times, and the movement of data on the ‘light’ can mean that the population's legs are smaller.
Watch out for a bottle of tea!
According to the "Central Society" report, recently, a recent study in Canada found that a pack of plastic teas might explain billions or even more than one million microbes, significantly higher than one person's annual estimates, but there is no evidence that the collection of plastics would constitute a threat to humanity.
It is reported that researchers at the University of Madrid, Canada, found that the contents of the bottle were placed in a glass of almost hot water (95 degrees) and that the tea packs would release some 16 billion pounds [11 billion pounds] of sugar and 31 million microbikes into a cup.
This number is significantly higher than the number of micro-organisms taken by one person throughout the year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the general population consumed at least 5 million microbes annually, while injecting the same amount of microbes.
It was reported that the study was published in the "Environment Science and Technology Journal" and that researchers tested the four different types of plastic stores in the Montserrat and the coffee department, opened the tea boxes, and filled almost 5 minutes after cleaning the cupboards in water, and re-scanned with an electronic display and lighting.
According to this study, they found that a single cup of more than 11 billion bottles of plastic was released, " the quantity of plastics in the past has increased by several levels " .
It is reported that most of the tea boxes are made of natural tobacco, but many of the use of tobacco is still in use by plastics.
Some of the cardboard boxes are out of paper, and they are used in plastics, which are the subject of research.
It is a small fraction of plastics, which researchers define the size of these plastics between 100 and 5 kilometres, mainly derived from plastic waste.
Researchers have found these microorganisms in the global air, soil, rivers and deep seas, from water, bottled water, sea and beer.
In October 2018, researchers discovered plastic microchips in a number of countries around the world.
In order to test the potential toxicities of tea to explain the potential toxicities of plastics, the Canadian research team found that they were placed in contaminated water, that the micro-organisms would affect the effects of these acids, and that they would be exposed to the development of phytosanitary surfaces.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), no evidence has yet shown that the use of pesticides poses a threat to humans.
However, WHO noted that further research was needed to fully understand how these particles were spread to the environment and what impact they had on mankind.
Researchers estimate that these tablets explain the causes of large quantities of plastic microchip, possibly because of the contact of these plastics with water, even when the "food level" fat increases to over 40 degrees, it is also possible to distinguish or extract toxic substances.
Gutres stated that the climate emergency was the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster would violate the development results of generations.
This has been described by Babuda, Dominica and Bahamas since this year.
About a quarter of the island developing countries live at 5 metres or less at sea.
Migration may seriously affect their social and lifestyles, even leading to the issue of sovereignty and national identity.
At this week's climate action summit, small island countries jointly committed themselves to achieving 100 per cent of carbon and renewable energy by 2030, which led the world back to the right direction.
Gutres said: " The climate crisis is putting a new unjust base on an old injustice.
Despite the small contribution made by small island developing countries to global warming, the highest price was paid.
As a result of the high-income status of these countries, many countries are also trapped in an accelerated and sustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must take action, making important decisions now and investing in small island developing countries. "
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for assistance to small island developing countries in managing disaster risks, investment in climate-adjustable infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and urged international institutions to help small island developing countries, in particular low-income middle-income countries.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of the oceans in the protection and preservation of Earth's life line.
The latest special report published by the Intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee on Climate Change this week confirms that the oceans have suffered serious consequences from the "study of climate crisis".
By the middle of this century, many regions may have been able to occur annually in some of the first century when an extremely high sea level would occur.
The report warns that some island countries may be unable to live without large amounts of funds in the area of adaptation.
Pollution, overcrowding and acidification have caused great losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all the living cells, and in the past 40 years, the contamination of plastics has increased ten times.
The needs of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are reducing resources, including the maintenance of many island communities.
Small island countries also face high transport costs, energy and infrastructure.
They rely heavily on some external markets to make them suffer from price fluctuations.
Some countries are also trying to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Gutres said: " By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve " the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda " will provide us with the tools, lessons and examples available to us worldwide. "
He stressed that small island developing countries were examples of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment throughout the international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India has shown that the financial system is flexible enough.
The Minister for Finance of India, on 26 September, indicated that the current financial system was sufficiently flexible and that, in response to the demand for consumption on the agenda, the economic growth of India was expected to be restored in the second half of the financial year of this financial year.
Sitaraman made the above statements after the meeting with the private banks of India, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
There is no reference to the specificity of these statements.
Some of the former Indian media and the overseas media have reduced the current economy of India ' s economy to the dynamic tension of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitarahman, for example, was sold by a car and denied the dynamic tension due to the failure of the seller.
Sitarahman noted that the impact of the main periodical factors on car sales was due.
Sitaraman expected that India's economic growth could be restored in the next half of its financial year, with the rise in consumption of the Sabbath.
From September to the end of the year, India's one-year procurement period will continue.
The market expects that the consumption of goods will greatly contribute to economic growth in India.
The Office of Education of the province of Jersey announced that high school secondary schools in the province had been in violation of the rules of procedure during the governor-General ' s leave, and that organizational staff could be visited on the occasion.
In the report on the "Notifications of the Recruitment of Enforced Heads of State", the Office of Education of the Province of Jersey stressed that secondary schools in all parts of the country need to be firmly established during the course: one must not organize a group of students or a new school, one must organize a course of academic training, a special course, an Osseban, an interest course, an increase in the level of education, and one must rent out a classroom, and another school accommodation for other educational institutions.

"Some over half of the over-age agricultural workers on the ground are estimated to be over half.
Where are you looking for young workers?
There's no way to use so many 'olds' on the ground either."
In recent days, a number of over-age agricultural workers (over-retirement years) have been in the hands of construction contractors for years.
In recent years, the book's seniors have been conducting rain-dropping engineering, where there are many agricultural workers in the classroom, and if you keep an eye on them, you will find that there are a lot of older farmers in this area.
The work outside the age of farmers is not "unsatisfied " , but because "unsatisfied " has to be so" - whether it's money to solve their problems of age and health or to help the children, the old people who are supposed to be "sustained" continue to work hard.
The "old-age" farmer's "old-fashioned" work isn't that easy to imagine.
Children, grandparents, children's books, children's cars, children's shelters, children's homes, children's homes, and children's homes, and children's private homes, when these farmers have completed " Life's mandate " , the cash bags have been emptied even a few of their debts, and there's a huge lack of wealth.
In order not to discourage children from putting on more material things for themselves, many farmers insist " until they do nothing " .
Many of the "90s" and "00s" of the new generation of farmers are not willing to work under difficult conditions, and the work is a high-performance second or low-service industry, resulting in structural " unemployment " , which is not attractive and provides an opportunity for overcrowded farmers.
Because of a lack of skills, physical and labour skills are also reduced, many over-age farmers work hard, low income, high risk and low-performance jobs.
One day, one day, a little bit, "I can't swim" behind the living conditions of over-age farmers, can't be ignored and ignored.
Improving the living conditions of older farmers, in addition to their " self-sustainment " , and not leaving the public sector ' s system of care and communications.
Researchers have noted that over-age farmers are less likely to rely on their homes to solve their own nutrition and health problems, and they must be confused by other methods of household care.
Learning that over-age farmers are "unsatisfied" and strong helps us to better understand the love and pain of over-skilled farmers.
Seeing the background of older farmers, listening to their frustrations, trying to bring them back to the village to realize " an old-fashioned " , needs the public sector, markets and society to share their responsibilities in a positive interaction, and needs more coherence.
Chemezov said that Russia would not export this system for the next five years, because " first of all, it would produce exports " .
This practice is entirely in line with international practice.
The main producer countries in arms and military equipment always first ensure their defence needs and then deal with export orders.
Formerly, General General of the Russian Air Force, General Yuri Glehov, indicated that the development work of the system would soon be completed.
The S-500 system is designed by the Kimcanstone-Anthi Air Protection Agency.
This is the principle of work for the destruction of ballistic and air-powered targets.
The main role of S-500 is the detonation of ballast missiles, which can be detonated in less than 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 may also destroy high-speed navigation missiles and aircraft, with almost all types of non-aircraft, more than 5-fold high-speed missiles, even in close space.
Such weapons can also be combined with other air defence systems, especially S-400 systems, which are very important from a national perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was currently in great need in the world, but the Russian army needed it, including in the Arctic region.
S-400 air defence systems enter the North-East Defence Force.
According to the report of 15 September, the task of the New Pacific Space Protection Mission has been completed in the context of the conversion of the S-400 air defence missile systems.
This is not the militaryization of Russia in the Arctic region.
The Russian Ministry of Defence states that this is entirely a process in the transition plan towards the North Strategy towards a more advanced defence tool.
The North Army news agency said: " The air traffic in the new S-400 air defence systems is significantly increased in the Arctic region as they pass through the new S-400 air defence systems. "
It is very important that, according to the military assessment, the system has been successful in its use in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
The air defence officers have trained the new system and have been preparing for entry into the battleground.
The former equipment is the S-300 remote air defence system, which is still a part of it.
As for the air defence system, it must have weapons that can destroy various air targets, whether the target of high-level high-speed flights or the " fishing of the network of the protected facilities " .
According to public sources, the S-400 ‘Triumph’ (Triumph) system designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed targets and other air weapons, is designed by the Golden Diamond-Andyta.
This weapon can attack air-powered targets within 400 km of the launch, and fall within 60 km of the target of the ballast flying every second of 4.8 km.
Russia will never hide it in addition to the air defence forces in the Arctic region in order to ensure the security of the airspace of the North Sea.
Before long, the 12th group "Tor" - M2DT" air-mission systems were sent to the northern regions of Russia, which were sufficient to form an air-conditioning camp and to strengthen the air-protection system in the northern region.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence indicated that the future of the North Atlantic Toledo forces would extend to the complete construction of tourism.
In addition, new deployments to S-400 remote systems on the New Isle and Kolahu Island and the deployment of "Pantsir" short-range systems in the Arctic region, which have a strong protection of Russian airspace.
The enemy's aircraft, helicopters and non-aircraft missiles will be difficult to break down this defense.
According to the Russian Government's opinion, flagships will be a platform for the manufacture of goods by Russian manufacturers to avoid the complex and long-term process of opening their shops.
Russian multinational companies, which are operators in the Russian market, focus on the sale of Russian goods in China.
Many Russians have the largest trading platform in online stores such as TMall, Kyoto (JD), 1688, Pinduduo, HandQ (ShouQ), and Wechat, China's largest communications software micro-enterprises, and have their own online platforms Evugio.com and Russian retail retail stores.
The Russian export centre will jointly develop marketing strategies and participation standards with Russia and select the product-producing enterprise.
The shop plans to open and up to at least 10 Russian manufacturers this year.
The information from the Russian export centre shows that China's electricity platform has a total monthly attendance of up to 100,000.
At the same time, exports of food to China have continued to grow stable since 2014, with over $100 million in 2018.
At the present time, the Arab Group will also launch a pilot shop in the context of global import strategies from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alex Kochovnikov, sales of at least 5 billion rubles in the new store will take place in the new store.
In fact, my expectations are higher and the sales of 5 billion rubs are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are very positive about Russian goods, considering our products as high quality and green environmental products. "
Kozhovnikov says that the competition between strong Chinese consumers for purchasing power is strong and is increasing.
He said, "Our goal is to launch 500 companies through this store in three years."
At the same time, the platform will also raise products from companies in the eastern regions of Russia.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of Trade Policy at the University of Economics, Russia, said: " This is a political project on behalf of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a country and not a civil body. "
"I have never seen very competitive Russian goods on a large market."
He believed that the project would probably not be truly implemented, but would help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian Federation, the President of the Russian Export Centre, Andrey Slepnev, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian companies had published product information on the largest international distribution network on the Alibaba.com platform, whether in China or in other countries.
In addition, there was a model of cooperation with the Alibaba Group, which was the training project of experts from the University of Poba to Russian companies, whose first seminar was held this year.
In November this year, the second Chinese international import blog at the Russian Export Centre will also be an organization for Russia ' s participation in industry exhibitions and business projects.
A large exhibition will be held at the 1000-mm exhibition office, where it will also serve as a business project activity, the signing of agreements, the presentation of meetings and the centre of meetings with representatives of the Central Enterprises.
About 50 applications have now been received from Russian agricultural companies.
The Russian Export Centre reported: " In addition to the agricultural exhibition, we must also hold business meetings, namely to arrange for direct contacts between entrepreneurs " .
" This is another direction that we are working towards, with the aim of supporting and ensuring a number of special meetings for our organizations. "
In addition, the exhibition will also hold a major seminar on Russian cuisine, which will be held at the top of the stadium and on the "exploration of the Seafront of Russia" project.

Public transport times are difficult to predict, road traffic and vehicle locations are difficult to find out, public transportation is difficult to solve, especially in some large cities, long hours of service, and the complex conditions of early hours of service, resulting in the fact that public transport destinations have been difficult to secure.

New timing: We are determined not to take our own way.
In response to the “New Age China and the World’s White Paper: China’s development has been successful for 70 years, largely because of the fact that China’s people have found a path to special socialism under the leadership of China’s Communist Party and are determined not to move along this path.
China's path is the choice of history, the choice of the people.
In an environment where poverty has been widespread and widespread, a generation of meek people have sought to find ways to save the country.
However, "The Constitution of the Constitution, the Rehabilitation, the Parliamentary, the Multiparty and the Presidency have been thinking, tried, and the results have not been understood."
As long as there are Chinese Communist parties and new China, the people of China are gradually opening up a unique path of socialism in practice.
This path that China has taken is the path of the happiness of the people of China, the path of the people of China's restoration, and the way of China's common development with the nations of the world.
It is because China is on the right path that it is able to do its own thing to become the world's second largest economy, to contribute to global economic growth and to continue to benefit the world through its own development.
As noted in the White Paper, this development path of China, in accordance with China ' s national circumstances and with the adaptation of the times, will be further reflected in the prospects for development in the past.
The Chinese people were aware of how difficult it was to find the right path; the Chinese people felt that the way was more dignified than the world.
The Chinese understand the reason for the South Pacific and understand that it is not necessarily appropriate for others to do so, but only for themselves.
It is in this way that China has created miracles for the world.
In the prehuman process, the "historic ending" was once named.
Today, the success of China's unique path of socialism has declared the end of "historic conclusion", the fall of "China's theory" and the failure of "Societalism".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in the achievement of the rich nation ' s richness and has expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and has provided experience and lessons for those who wish to speed up their development and to maintain their independence from the world and their peoples, in line with their national circumstances.
The world is rich in colors.
China's history respected the right of States to choose a path to their own development.
China will not "enter "foreign and output" China's model, but will be determined not to remove its own ways, achieve its own sustainable development, strengthen the governance exchange with countries, and contribute to the achievement of good governance together.
In the Fair Work Commission, a manager in the city of Foodworks found that a 66-year-old female employee was hired by means of a letter of confidence, as he was more willing to employ workers from the Asian background, who was severely beaten by the employer as " alcoholic " .
The Committee said that Ms. Gail Ayton, a 20-year-old master constructionist (Jianbin Wang, English name Eddie), worked at Wagga Wagga Wagga Store, worked in a " very unfair " way against workers, and perhaps violated anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. King took over the store in 2016 and he was always "to get rid of me " because she wasn't a witch.
In this case, the Vice-President of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found " Mr. King's previous announcements of recruitment in Australian employment forums " .
In the work requirements listed at these posts, one of them says " Ms. First Asia " , the other says " First Asian Workers " .
The third proverb says that he is " more inclined to the outsiders (like the original text) " .
Mr. Wang hired Ms. Ayton through communication this year, which was later reported to be a loss of cash from $5.10 to $30 due to her lack of employment and alleged lack of cash from $30.
However, Mr. Sams said that Mr. King had abandoned Ms. Ayton's employment for very poor reasons, and there was no evidence.
For three years she's only been missing a couple of extras, "loss of money."
He said that Ms. Ayton had been fired " in fact, she had nothing to do with her behavior or expression " .
He said: " In my view, in support of the evidence of the fact that Mr. King's announcement of recruitment was based on the fact that he was more willing to hire a worker who had a background in Asia.
In accordance with article 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, the conduct of the King constitutes an unlawful violation of the law against discrimination and/or the dismissal of the applicant. "
Mr. Sams said that since Mr. King's treatment of Ms. Ayton's "manage news" was not appropriate, he considered her position to be inappropriate.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, who was a temporary worker and who paid 26 extra hours.
In view of the possible violation of legislation against discrimination and labour relations, Sams stated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the Committee to consider whether the conduct of the King should be transferred to other institutions in order to investigate possible violations of State or federal law.
He said that Mr. Ayton had no opportunity to reply to Ms. Ayton on the grounds that she had been fired.
He said: " I believe that the defendant should have taken an unjust and disproportionate procedure to disseminating the applicant, Mr. " waiting" for this opportunity, and he believed it would be proper to ' prove ' that the employment of the applicant is ending ' . "
"He's wrong ... ...and should be completely ignored by the plaintiff when he opens the petitioner to give her any natural justice, and it's amazing that he's rude and extremely unjust. "
Mr. Sams said that, although Foodworks was a small enterprise, " it must be clear that any right-wing employers would not be able to eliminate employees in the present case in a very unfair and unfair way."
He said, "This is a drinker and a very unfair one."

It was pointed out that China's development had taken place at a new point in history, and China's people were fighting China's dream of a new generation of special socialism, which had not been able to overcome China's dreams of great reviving the Chinese people.
China will continue to " development is the first thing, the first resource, innovation is the first motivation " , the major implementation of innovative mobility development strategies and the promotion of economic quality development.

The world's top senior editor died at 108 years of age.
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest-level director of the World Records of the United States of America, has never retired from retirement to being a guest, but he died of cancer and disease in 19 June and reported his death in his 96-year-old life.
According to CNN, when Mansinelli was 8 years old, he moved to the United States and soon started to clean up the floor in a studio, and at 12 years of age, he began to take the knife to a guest service, reducing the economic pressure in his home.
At the time, she was in primary school, but later she did not graduate.

In order to maintain the company's image of the company's price, over the next two years the company has begun to collect the value of the company's low-valued information to the market, thereby stabilising the price of the company's investment confidence.
Eastern wealth data from Choice showed that in 2017, the capital of the municipal company was $79 billion for the repurchasing share, which increased to $5.1 billion in 2018, and since 2019 it has been over $1 billion in the capital of the company A, leading to the creation of a new amount of the acquisition of funds, and far beyond that of the previous year.
In view of the purpose of the acquisition, the company's repurchasing shares were similar to the larger shares, but there was a significant difference in the implementation of the topic, the source of funds, the purpose of the acquisition, and the right of the shares itself.
In accepting an interview with the newspaper " witness journal " , the Director-in-Office of the Executive Director of the Maritime Information Council of the United States stated that, in November 2018, the " opinion of support for the acquisition of the shares in the city " was more extensive and complex in the decision-making process, and the problems of the existing system of savings had been corrected, which had begun to encourage the purchase of the company from the previous policy, resulting in a significant increase in the occurrence of the repurchasing of the year.
In January of this year, the above-mentioned office issued a formal " rules for the implementation of the rules for the acquisition of shares in the company " , which were extended to the source of the purchase of funds in the company , the appropriate simplification of procedures for the implementation of good governance arrangements , and the encouragement of the various types of companies to promote the implementation of the Joint Undertaking or staffing Plan .
After the comments were made, the operation of the acquisition of shares in the market was more applicable, the recovery process was easier and the asset was more active.
In relatively low-placed procurement shares, it also contributes to the efficiency of the use of the funds of the above-market companies, thereby increasing the level of profit per unit, increasing net asset income and reducing the pressure of the company's profit indicators.
The increase in the value of the market-backed shares is greater than the increase in the market-based shares, as well as an indication of the market-led will to manage market value and cash flows.
The Sun believes that the cost of the asset was assessed as a major factor in the acquisition of over-crowded companies and that the cost of the company could no longer reflect the future development prospects of the company, so such companies were worth the attention of investors, but could not be invested for blind purposes, and needed to pay attention to the finances of such companies as well as to specific operations.
An overcrowded market company with a large repurchasing operation, at least showed the company's development trust and financial strength.
The increase in the rate of demand and the normalization of the repurchasing behaviour of the repurchasing company shows that nearly a thousand companies have already implemented the repurchasing of the shares in this year and that the R & D companies in various sectors have become the main capital of the repurchasing market.
China's recent security disclosures indicate that the company has accumulated 57,559,000 units of unit A through central investment transactions, representing 0.315 per cent of the company's total assets, a total of $50 million (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchasing shares will be all used for the staffing unit plan, including, but not limited to the long-term service plan adopted by the Conference of the Company's Partners.
The ILI has paid 57.92 million for the acquisition of the shares and has been adjusted for the purpose of the repurchasing of the shares in recent years, and the remaining 3049 million will be used for the registration of capital reduction as a source for the subsequent implementation of the shares. "
The ILI component stated that the registration of the partially recovered shares would help to further increase the level of income of each unit and effectively increase the investment returns of the company's shares.
The TCL Group's press release on 25 September revealed that the TCL Group had a total of 3.59 per cent of its corporate shares, which amounted to $16.5 million.
The Board of Directors of the TCL Group indicated to the journalist "Court Journal" that the repurchasing shares would be used for the staff holding plan, to encourage or to convert the corporate debt that could be converted into the stock.
The TCL Group continued its established operational strategies to enhance competitiveness and sustainable health development.
Based on the maintenance of confidence and the interests of future corporate investors, combined with the performance of the company's second-year markets, and the integration of factors such as the operation of companies and the financial situation, the company plans to use its own funds, its own funds and other ways of acquiring its shares.
According to former seafarers, chief economists in the Fund for the Exploration of the Oceans Fund said that the operation of a market-backed company could, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in circulation on the market and increase the profits of each market-based company's income, which would be an important benefit for the second market price; and, on the other hand, the market-based companies would be willing to launch a real-best bank and sell the stock-backs from the market-backed market, which greatly boosted market confidence.
In recent years, domestic ventures have gradually increased, in particular by the performance unit, to raise confidence in investors through the acquisition of shares, a very good way to be sure and encouraging.
The National Council of the Province of Lake Lakes, the Long Sea City Commission, remembers the four major hands of the engineering machine — the new, the stable, the clean, and the flanging, and around "the construction of a "small goal" of the world's leading mechanical engineering group three five years later.
In the long term, the creation of a world-leading mechanical engineering group, which is now called " the strongest map " .
As a city in the province of the Land, what's going on?
It's the power of the atmosphere.
The four engine engines that participated in the dialogue, one of which was capable of covering the sky, the ground, and the whole area of the land: the light aircraft of the mountains, the mixed land transport of the complex sections, the three-worked ground surfaces, and the construction of the iron-based pipelines, whose "hard-power" can be seen under the so-called independent sky.
At times, China does not have the right to speak in the field of engineering.
In time, China's companies introduced "go out" two-wheeled drive to the east wind, the acquisition, the integration of buildings, and the creation of a multiplicity of the global engineering industry.
Three of them are the three main economic indicators, such as the merger, the construction of iron, the construction of the engine industry, the value of the engine, the market, and the sale of major economic indicators, such as the rivers of wisdom, the value of the engine industry, the value of the market, and the value of the market.
It's a time bomb that's moving through the camera.
The four-year-old mechanical engineering machine was the leading company in the global engineering engineering industry, which was the founder of the long-term engineering engineering industry.
The one who lives and lives well in the world industry is the hard air that speaks.
In earlier years, the global engineering industry suffered colds and many internationally known engineering engineering industries collapsed, but the long-term engineering industry produced the "catches " as " cold " , self-contained pressure , self-contained industrial transformations, not only by making changes to the mind but also by strengthening the body.
It is the power of the political leaders of the Moon.
The development of a prosperous industry, both needing an active enterprise, and needing the government to be active.
Due to the glory of the "all engineering machinery" in the long run, the company's development and production of the company's production and sales costs are significantly reduced through the optimization of the business environment.
A good commercial eco, making engineering machinery for the company.
History has moved Sasha to the front of a global engineering engine leading level, when I don't want it, and I don't want it.

Gandhi Sun: The sheep of the lake comes out of poverty.
In September, the earthquake struck the top of the yellow soil.
In the community's professional cooperation in the breeding of cattle, 58-year-old Shavili filled out the last piece of bread in the sheep's shell and kept it on the side of the nest, looking at the white sheep's mouth.
"That's good. When the winter is full, it's a good price to sell. "
Shavili said he gave the sheep a " special meal " every day, regularly cleans up health, kills the virus, and has no patience.
Shavili has been feeding more than 20 years of sheep, and until the cooperative company has worked, it knows how hard it has been for the past.
Shavili is the village of Huang-ha-ha-ha-in-law of Chung-in-Kung-in-Kong, in the province of Guangdong.
His left-hand side is a shepherd, but insists on traditional ways of feeding, poor quality of sheep, and a small amount of wool.
In June, under the leadership of the Government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative and everything began to change.
Shavili's mother-in-law has been raising her head all day because she's always in her heart.
The people in the unit are poor, and they're all in charge of the company, and they can't divide the red and sell the price, but they're dependent on him.
With the guidance of the technical staff, he gradually learned to control the vaccine, had scientific food, and became a few " well-dressed " in the village.
The reproductive professional cooperation company is a standardized cooperative, with 16 sheep and nearly 1400 sheep.
The chief of the cooperative said that there was a lot of doors outside the standardized sheep.
"The sheep must be built around three-and-a-half, and the wind must be replaced by warm air."
In order to prevent vaccines, it is also necessary to regularly treat the virus and to attack three to four times a week for the sheep.
"Little sheep" is not only a good place to eat, but it has to be eaten with a mixture of corn and corn and a mixture of herbs, and there's a pretty wide range of "float".
Cooperatives have taken care of their livelihoods and have led local farmers to invest in the good sheep, to unite, manage, sell, achieve well-being, scientificization, standardization and collective feeding.
Now, with 140 per cent of the sheep belonging to the Unit, more than $6,000 per year is being allocated to the cooperatives.
From "Pears of the Mountains" to "Principals" , from "Locally shared" to "manufacturers " , from "species, skin" to "B" ..... in the Sun, meat breeds are not only a way of feeding, but also a way of changing the pattern of "Communication Company+ Farmer" by changing the views of the old mountaintops and the town-based sheep" to overcome the weak breakdown of traditional agricultural practices, the poor days of farmers as a result of modern feeding become better.
It is said that, if market prices are low, the local companies will increase their agricultural development thresholds by helping farmers to break down market risks with a market price of 27 kilograms per kilogram.
The Director-General for Agriculture and Rural Development of Guangdong said that the company had increased its awareness of " sheep " through the provision of loans to the poor, the supply of sheep, the provision of individual feeding, the payment of purchases, and the harmonization of trade sales.
In the sun, at least 8200 poor families have been able to grow crops, grow well, scale, divide, market sales, and achieve stable growth.
There was a shortage of agricultural error in the northern part of the city of Chung-song, and the raw resources were abundant.
Currently, there are 913 sheep breeding sites throughout the city, cooperatives, and over 5 million sheep feeding companies, and two thirds of a million sheep-sized manufacturing lines are being built, and the flock is becoming the " leader of the poor " of the local industry.

In introducing France's 2020 budget, Lemer stated that the latest European Central Monetary Lending Initiative had created an opportunity for increased investment for those Member States that had the capacity to undertake.
The European Centre was launched on 12 September and planned to reopen the procurement debt in order to reduce the cost of borrowing, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and increase the rate of inflation.
"The low interest rate will not bring Europe back to its prosperity, but monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough," Lemer told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, now needs, sooner or later, and don't wait until the situation gets worse," he adds.
He has made this appeal to Germany several times.
France has implemented a reduction of over €100 billion this year, which has brought great impetus to France's economic growth.
The global economy has lost its power, and the German economy that is dependent on exports is at the top of it.
Lemer noted that next year the tax burden of the French family would reduce the tax exemptions of EUR 93 billion, including EUR 50 billion.
In addition, the corporate tax rate will decrease from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent during the five-year period, and the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost EUR 10 billion.

Research: A small increase in the U.S. public health nutrition index, but still has challenges - in the new network
On 27 September, a recent study in the United States revealed that, in 16 years, the U.S. Government's healthy diet indicators had an appropriate growth, ranging from 56 to 58.
But in the case of 100, it's not worth celebrating.
American citizens are still facing " significant challenges " in their eating.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Tavts University of Massachusetts, U.S.A., said that Americans were still exposed to too many diseases that could lead to heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease, all of which are the most common diseases among American citizens.
This study was published on the American Medical Journal on 24 days.
The study was based on the conclusions of the U.S. Government's health survey conducted between 1999 and 2016 for 4.4 million adults.
The authors wrote, " Despite the apparent improvement, significant food challenges remain " .
These challenges have been reported to include reducing the number of people in the United States of America to less than zero, hot dogs, cows, oil, and fatty and fatty foods.
The study found that the daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent and exceeded the 10 per cent of the recommended intake.
The biggest improvement in U.S. national diets is the reduction in sugar intake from 16 per cent to 14 per cent, but the level of intake remains high.
Officials believe that the amount of added sugar should be less than 10 % in daily meals.
For reasons of reduced intake of sugar, researchers believe that the reduction in the use of sweetening water is relevant, but the strain emphasizes that sugars are often added to even unsaturated foods, such as milk and sugar.
American adults have a little more access to fruit, vegetables, corn and other types of vegetables.
However, the 2016 data show that these food remains below 5 per cent of the daily intake.
Despite a slight decrease in the intake of pellets, the decrease in the consumption of pellets led to the introduction of low-quality hydrochloric acid compounds, however, it has been noted that they still account for 42% of the daily temperature, many of which are from the white surface packaging and other raw materials processed.
This study is based on a two-year individual health survey that will remind adults of the food they ate in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asking this question twice a day since 2003.
The U.S. Food Guidelines issued by the Government recommend that people use " Healthy eating patterns " to reduce the possibility of chronic illness.
The Guide points out that food collection should be widely distributed, such as food, fruit, whole grains, low-fat products, as well as can be supplied with protein-based seams, meats, meats, eggs, seed-based foods.
The number of people with diabetes among the U.S. population increased almost once, and more than 7 per cent, and the incidence of obesity has increased over the many years of surgery — now that about 70 per cent of American adults are overweight or are pregnant.
In addition, heart disease remains the main cause of the death of American nationals.

However, after the meeting of the Commission of Malawi, it was announced to the Supreme Council of the State to decide whether to continue to be transferred from the capital of Malawi or to the replacement of other members.
Following the meeting of the Central Committee in Malawi on Thursday afternoon, the House of Lords announced to the media that any sub-election would take place on the basis of the standard operating procedure (SOP) that was required to meet with the Supreme Council of the State.
He said that, since the election committee would meet only on the following week (1 week) to determine the election of the Danish Supreme Council of the United States, it was expected that the meeting of the Supreme Council of the State would be held in early October.
"I also met the President of the State, Mr. Nassius Avanzashi yesterday (26th morning), and we all agreed that we must withdraw this House from the hope of the Union. "
"We will hold a meeting of the Heads of State for a special position in October, and the Group of the Third Party of the State Party will determine the position of which Party. "
The question of whether the Mawa will continue to stand before the Supreme Council of the State, and the House of Commons reaffirms that he, as President of the Republic of Malawi, must act in accordance with the standard operating procedure, and any decision must be reached by consensus of the State.
"In any election, people are willing to go out, political parties, or something they think they should come out, that's an empty routine."
"The most important thing is that we come from what organization and political union?"
" This is a great test for our political union for many years, and we believe that the country's leader is on the way to hold some valuable values. "
"In this process, someone might say something, that's weird."
"But once the Supreme Council of the State has decided, all must strive to fight, that is the most valuable."
In any case, the House of Lords has indicated that Malawi will be preparing for the next three-phase rounds, namely the Conference of the Regions, the Council of State and the Central Council.
"In the context of the regional council, the President of the Division (Danjubi A) was led by Nassirijuju, who was led by the State Council, and was trained by the President of the Board of Directors of the Council of State, Nasserin, and centrally by the Director-General of the Office of the United States of the United States and the Secretary-General, and by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

In a loud and loud voice, the head of the "Water Forests" project, the leader of the "Water Forests" project, and the user's representative, took the award from the sponsors of the United Nations "The Earth Guard Award" in 2019.
In 2019, the Earth Guard Award was held in New York, U.S.A. on 26 days, with the award of an "Intimate and Action Award" of the "Emocratic Forests" project, which includes the participation of millions of people in environmental operations by telephone.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced a winning list at the headquarters of Nairobi, Kenya's capital, but those who attended the award ceremony were still hard to imagine.
The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, E.E. Anno, said in an interview with the New Yorkers, that the "Occupy Forests" was an exciting innovation that led millions to action to learn what environmental challenges mankind faces and what humans can do for the environment.
It connects humans and the environment through technology and enables each body to participate in action to protect the earth, which will have a great impact.
In August 2016, the Chinese Financial Services Group launched a series of low-carbon actions, such as low-carbon energy, and low-carbon energy in mobile phones, by using the Green Paper in the "Occupy Forests" in the "Employment Forests" of August 2016.
Every time the user cultivates a fragrant tree, the forest and public partners will produce the next real tree in the desert.
As of August this year, 5 million "square forest" users reduced their consumption of 772 million tons of carbon, with an estimated 1.2 billion tons of wood in the desert areas.
In the "earthguard Award" issued that day, Costa Rica's country-wide security efforts have been rewarded, and former Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado, who has been leading the award, has commended the contribution of the "Plancho Forests" on the scene, " which can stimulate so many people to engage in green action to impress people deeply " .
The President of the Zhao Kinqing and the Chief Executive Officer, said that "The Earth Guard Award" was certain of the project "The Forests of the Forests."
Technical and open platforms allow people to participate in low-carbon life, which is the honour of all participants.

The public environmental protection model created by the "Digin Forests" has also been successful by other countries.
This June, the largest "GCash" electronic wallet in the Philippines launched the "GCash Forests " , encouraging the Philippines users to better protect the environment through low-carbon life.
It was suggested that GCash would join the Philippines's Department of Environment and Natural Resources, environmental welfare organizations, and plan to start 365 million trees in the Philippines within a year.
"The Earth Guard Award" is the highest award in the United Nations area of environmental protection and is issued once a year.
The "Water Forests" award, followed by the construction of the Sahan Forests in China, followed by the "Water Forests" exhibitions in the province of Zhaoin in China, followed by the project "Water and Action Awards" from China's green innovation project, continued its third year.
The United States Economic and Social Committee has been affected by the " performance list " .
The United States ' second quarter economic success list this year shows that private sector investment and exports have a significant decline in the overall GDP of the United States.
The analyst noted that the uncertainty brought about by the Commodity and the uncertainty caused by the private sector investment and export fluctuations in the second quarter.
The final modification data published by the United States Department of Commerce showed that the United States GDP is 2 per cent increase by year and is equivalent to that previously published, but is significantly lower than 3.1 per cent of one quarter.
Data show that consumption growth is a major factor in the economic growth of the United States in the second quarter of the year.
About 70 per cent of the total United States economy consumption is increased by 4.6 per cent and by 3.03 per cent of the slow economic growth.
In addition, government spending and investment-related economic growth were 0.82 percentage points.
However, the private sector investment in the second quarter declined by 6.3%, slowing down by 1.16 percentage points, and lowering by 5.7 per cent by exports by the second quarter, and net export slowing by 0.68 per cent by the second quarter.
The U.S. Enseide Economics Consultant Bari Knapp, managing partners, stated that private sector investment has not only been able to maintain the momentum of growth last year, but has been significantly reduced because of the rise in drug abuse and uncertainty in the fight against corporate confidence.
Knapp believes that under policy uncertainty, future United States enterprise capital expenditure is expected to remain in decline.
The analyst believes that although consumption growth has made a powerful contribution to the United States economy in the second quarter, there is growing evidence that the uncertainty of the Commission and its findings have affected consumer confidence and has a negative impact on the United States consumption outlook.
The survey manager, Professor of Economics Richard Constantine of the University of Michigan, said that 38 per cent of consumers in the recent survey had themselves referred to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was new in half a year.
For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally believe that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, experts have also indicated that the performance of the United States industry and the financial markets will improve if it is slowed down by the Commodity.
The British Economics Foundation, global economist Karen Bitch, expected that the future United States economy would continue to slow down and increase to a lower level than the second quarter of the year.
Mudi analysed the company's main economic scientist, Mark Zaddy, predicting that the United States would increase by 2.3 per cent this year, and that the next year would be reduced by 1.6 per cent.
The investment manager, Ellen Hahn, of Patnan Investments, pointed out that the most serious concern of the present enterprise is the uncertainty of trade and its effects, and that if it can be resolved by trade, uncertainty will greatly decrease, and the industry will be much better than it is now.
“The first issue” is the main reason why the United States capital market is still moving in this year, says the equity policyist Matt Meli, who is currently a member of the Mile-Tabak asset management company, will be the key to the impact of the US capital market on the remaining period of the year.

Among them, the Central Financial Institution transfer work performed by the Ministry of Finance has been essentially completed.
Central enterprise transfer has a certain size.
At the local level, the enterprise transfer of pre-term work is carried out separately.
As at the end of 2018, the pilot work in the two provinces of Guangdong was essentially completed, with a capital of $158 million and 185 million respectively.

The National Fund for the Transfer of True Social Security Fund — issued at the beginning of the "Principal Fund for Social Security" — is designed to provide a strong support for the protection of the elderly.
However, the authors believe that this was not a simple "physical transfer " , but opened " mathematical code " .

With population ageing, my community's funds are under pressure, and most of them have sustained benefits and redundancy, not only able to supplement the Fund effectively, but also to provide basic living water for the Social Security Fund.
It has been estimated that each country that has capital of 3.8 per cent of its turnover, i.e., can support the basic old-age insurance balance of companies under 1 per cent.
The third phase, " Results of the Law " , is an increase in the stability of the capital market.
The way in which this subsequent transfer of income to the subject is obtained is " red-head and transport as a plug " .
The Social Fund, as a financial investor with capital in the country, is indeed the head of the shareholding.
However, as a valuable investor in the capital market, the Social Security Fund has a stronger capacity to operate capital.
In respect of capital assets in the country, the Social Security Fund will participate in the maintenance unit and further improve the governance structure of civil enterprise law and facilitate the promotion of business operating levels and have a positive impact on the capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a target of investment, maintains a dominant role in the promotion of the shares, contributes to further strengthening its market impact and to the role of "stabilizers" in the market.

China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
(New China 70) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper notes that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
According to the White Paper, as China's integrated national and international influence increased rapidly, some internationally worried about China ' s " urgent " approach to China ' s " road, and some presented the so-called " Chinese threat " .
This is a well-known misunderstanding, a profound prejudice, and a strong psychological imbalance that has led to the removal of the mental confusion, and a strong tendency to maintain self-interest.
The realization of national wealth, national reviving, the happiness of the people, both the dreams of the people of China and the common dreams of the peoples.
" The development of China is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge. "
The White Paper notes that China is the world's main stabiliser and incentive source of economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's technological innovations are new to global economic growth, and China's future economy's stabilization and the role of energy sources is more evident.

China's economy is moving towards high-quality development, new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, rapid progress in modernization, extensive economic structural adjustment, continued industrial optimization, and new economic growth points continue to rise.
" The study of the University of Mackenzie Global Studies found that by 2040, China and other economies in the world would create a huge economic value of between $22 billion and $37 billion, corresponding to 15 - 26 per cent of the global economy as a whole, and the strengthening of cooperation between other economies and China. "
The White Paper stresses that China ' s economy and the world economy have been in structural change and is deeply integrated.
Economic operations are more stable, higher growth quality, and long-term prospects for growth in China are a long-term benefit to the world economy.
Consider China ' s economic development as " threat " and " challenge " , attempting to expose China to global industrial links, supply chains, value chains , to remove China ' s " economy from the world ' s economy " , both ineffective and harmful.
The White Paper notes that the whole area is open to all countries to share "China's Red."
China is determined not to move through an open strategy of mutual benefit, to achieve greater effort, to a higher level of openness, to have the world's most powerful consumer markets, to the most attractive investment destination in China, to the greater extent "to the advantage of more countries.
"The opening should be bilateral, mutually beneficial and not unilateral, one-part-beneficiary.
The two benefits can last a long time."
The White Paper notes that China has committed itself to continuing to expand its imports, to expand market access, to improve the business environment, to strengthen intellectual property protection, and to extend to other countries, to take appropriate initiatives to improve their business environment.
Only by direct action can the production of open, inclusive, universal, balanced, shared development environments increase the growth of the "ekek" together and create a mutually beneficial community of interests.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public products to the international community.
Including promoting high-quality co-ordinated " one-way " , with multilateral dialogue and cooperation platforms, active participation in international and regional affairs and active external assistance.
" China's development benefits the international community, and never forget to return to international large families to provide better public products for the international community. "

"I've done it all." Two special printing presses.
On 26 days, from the east to the south to the 1100 000 WWW high-pressure power plant, the total GIL power supply of 1000 W.E.
Both of these projects are a high point in the control of the current world electricity technology in their respective areas, and the deployment will result in a significant increase in the overall efficiency of our country's energy.
The Director-General of the National Energy Agency has wisely stated that from East to South, the world's largest power supply of electricity is the remotest power generation.
Its shipments are important for the development of the New Zealand energy base and for the protection of electricity supply in the eastern part of the country.
GIL, that's the absolute metal of the gas shutting off the electricity line.
The Sutton Bridge Engineering has created the highest global pressure level in the GIL project and the highest transmission capacity record and has achieved the ‘interference of the bi-circuit network’ operation at the top pressure level of the WAO.
According to the National Electronics Company, the distance from the East to the South-East was 3324 km long.
If regular technologies are used, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost in the process, and the project has been under attack and has increased from a distance of more than 3,000 km.
After the launch of the East and South-West Engineering, it is possible to transmit 10 billion electricity every 8 hours and to help solve the problem of the new energy supply in New Zealand.
In accordance with the estimates, electricity will be available only in the year of this line, which will reach 600 to 850,000 hours, which will be sufficient for more than half of the entire year.
The SOUTH GIL integrated power plant is a high-pressure transmission network that is overrun by a long-term control plant.
If the normal airway is crossed, two large railway towers of over 450 metres will need to be built on the length of the long line, and an island will be built for each trainer over four football fields.
In this regard, the National Electronics Network has been highly innovative and has developed a rapid high-pressure exchange of GIL electricity technology and has been flowing from water through channels and has avoided the impact of gold pipelines.
Two projects to promote the production of electricity equipment in our country have achieved a new flight.
At present, the national electricity network has been compiled as a "10 to 11 to "high pressure" and "4 to 3" to be built.

The White Paper states that China has developed in an interconnection with the world, that China's development is in the right energy for world peace and development, and that China's roads are in line with China ' s situation and adaptable times.
China maintains world peace by actual action.
For 70 years, China has not actively promoted any war and conflict and has not violated a country ' s territory.

New rules for the search for advice: Social capital is required for access to the right to rural land
Social capital is required to acquire the right to rural land
"Agreed Land Operating Management" is open to comment on the provision of regulations on the acquisition of land operating rights for social capital flows, such as business enterprises.
Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture website published an announcement on the " rural land-based transfer management approach (recasting for a draft opinion) " (hereinafter referred to as " comments " ) that increased the regulation and risk prevention of land-based flows of social capital, such as business flows.
"Communication" is now open to society.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that, in order to implement the new " rural land contract law " , further consolidate and improve the basic rural operating system, deepen the reform of rural land systems and implement " triangular distribution " system, and that the Ministry of Agriculture revised the " rural land transfer management approach " to the " rural land contract " to form an " opinion " .
The Beijing Young Journalist knows how important the first release of the "disclosures" has been.
The revised " rural land contract law " has clarified the scope of land flow, followed by the concept of " triangular distribution " , the definition of " land contract operating " and " land operation " respectively, the distinction between the transfer of land contract power, exchange and land operating rights (retirement, transfer, unit or other means) has been clearly distinguished.
In this "disclosure" in order to follow the concept of "tribalization" of the concept of triangularity, to respond effectively to the amendment of " rural land contract law " and to take into account the shift of land law and the exchange of land contract rights, transfer to parties, procedures, regulation, etc., this amendment has been defined as a means of managing the movement of land-based land-based rights, including leases, entry into units, and the change in the terms of " rural land-based land-based land-based land-based transfer " .
For the transfer of land contracts to operational rights, exchanges of alternative management methods of another platform are provided.
The "disclosure" indicates that, in the context of "tribal decentralization", the agricultural income unit has only a fixed-term land operating right.
According to the theory, even if there was an insolvency settlement, farmers were only at risk of losing a certain period of operation and therefore provided that they had no need to return the original contractor to the legal base and that there was a conflict with the insolvency law.
In practice, priority was given to the prevention of the risk of land loss to farmers, the pre-retirement unit, and the means of repurchasing.
Taking into account the more experienced theory of the priority unit in corporate law, it is recommended that it be promoted as a precautionary provision for preventing the risk of entry into the entity.
