The social map of the population of Ivanov area is recognized by electronic means of payment.
Changes include the maintenance of public passenger transport benefits.
Since 24 September, the arrangements for the smooth travel of citizens using the social map of the inhabitants of the Ivano region have been changed.
As reported by the Press Service of the Government of Russia in the Ivanian Area, the changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger transport benefits and provide a social card-based scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the National Payment System.
The social map of the inhabitants of Ivanov area is therefore recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its use are changed.
Yes, the completion limit is now set, not in earlier travel, but in the amount of money, with the maintenance of winter and summer periods - not more than 400 rubles, during the summer period - not more than 800 rubles per month.
Now the social card holders will have to monitor the number of remaining travel and the rest of the money.
The cost of a leisure travel for citizens is 1/2 tariffs for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the area budget.
The social card supplement chart remains past - from 24 previous months to 23 current months.
The new roadmap will have a number of advantages.
Thus, there is an opportunity to take detailed account of the cost of money on the social card with accuracy to the child.
In addition, there is an opportunity to return the estimated but unutilized funds.
We also add that the system of mutual accounts with the carriers is transparent, as half the cost of travel is now paid by a citizen, and the same amount is paid by the carrier to the carrier.
No commission will be taken when the money is submitted.
In turn, Vassili Silkin, Deputy Director of the Department of Road Affairs and Transport in the Ivano region, reported that in 2014, more than 33 million social maps had been made in the region, and almost 25 million trips had been made in 2015.
More than 470 million rubles are provided in the area budget for the welfare of citizens using the social map.
As of 1 September, the amount of compensation for these targets amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
At the time of the call, 911 teachers were admitted to the murder of a friend
During a call in 911 vote, almost without the help of the teacher of the village, Sean Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that there was a need for staff to come to his house.
Lamb stressed that there was a ghost in the house who was alive, but probably upset, and said that the contact of the missing family members could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note that was carefully written on a white-lined book: "I'm so sorry, I wish I'd come back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says a note by the representatives of the bodies signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that the Lamb, who held two online courses at the University of Delt in Cleveland, Mississippi, was finally able to meet 300 miles in a university camp where, as the police think, he shot all the respected teacher of the story of Ethan Schmidt at his office.
The chief of police at the University of Delta, Lin Baford, reported that the University staff had learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call in 911 shortly thereafter.
At the end of the victim's day, there is one more: the Lamb ended with him as the police surrounded him.
The following day after the shooting at the school had forced students and teachers to go outside the closed doors, officials of the authorities were still trying to put in a picture of the motivations that led to Lamba.
Information shared by researchers in both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew it, helped build the portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told him that they waited patiently for him to take the job.
The police in Gotia, where Prentiss was killed, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his written book, in which he expressed appreciation for the “precious people” he had moved to his teaching life.
They both taught social sciences and history, consisting of 17 teachers, and many students attended the lectures of others.
At the same time, there were some premonitions of problems.
A student who had a good reputation for Lambe, Brandon Bevers, reported that he was also saying, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sakes, reported that at the end of the school year 2014-15, Lamb told him how he struggled with stress.
Earlier, Lamb had asked the University of Delta to grant him a leave of illness, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university rules to accept employment meant that the level of doctor who had worked so hard on Lamb would not guarantee him automatic access to the teacher's position.
The president of the University of William Laforz reported that he had no knowledge of the conflict between Lambo and Schmidt, but "of course, Mr. Lamba had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked after Lamba's escape from the camp when he went back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot 38 calibres from a gun at the back of the house, one mile south of his parents' home in the town of Greenville, Mississippi, reported to the Crown of Washington, Metel Johnson.
His car with the engine was still on the way.
It was not long before Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived in it.
The Lamb grew up in those days.
Lamb began to work at a university that included 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12000 and taught geography and pedagogical in 2009.
He received a doctor's degree of pedagogical science in the same year.
One of the ancient friends of Lamba described him as a wise, charismatic and happy man.
Carla Herston said she was 15, and Lambu was 20 when they met by common friends.
She and her friend have been studying in senior classes, and he has been a high school boy who has been trying to learn to play guitar for years.
In those years he was successful in women.
All the girls in the talisman when he was a few," says Herston, now 40 and now living in Jackson, in the province of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss at the time of the events, we see they've been meeting for a while.
At the time of the call in 911 Lamb, he said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage registration.
There was a song by the name of Lainting, who lived with them in Gota in a crepic house, the back of which is on the channel.
According to the police, the dog is all right.
Former husband Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago, but they were friends, and that they have a daughter now 19 years old.
"She's quite excited," O'Stin said about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lambo, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blue.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both spoke at a three-year festival last year.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin said his daughter's writing music and poetry.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online on various companies.
Mike Schaffer, Barman and the co-ordinator of entertainment programs at The Julep Room in Gotty's property, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of 5 September, when Lamb finished playing guitar and losing his hat for a few visitors.
There was no suspect.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We enjoyed each other and looked for each other.
I mean, they were both very serious.
Schmidt, a missing teacher, conducted a seminar for primary teachers and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, told Don Allen Mitchell, an English teacher in the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Ethiopia, and was the president of the student brotherhood and of the student self-government.
About 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial celebration of the candles.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony during which the University choir of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace attended.
The jobs are renewed in the middle.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforz.
Crisis has passed.
Today's birthday.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors of the Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a statement by the police that Lamba had arrived in office 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that although Lamb had spoken about Prentiss as his wife when he called in 911, the information they had been married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff at the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that there will not be enough staff in the holiday season, as many as in the past year, while the toys and children's goods are assured that the staff and temporary staff will be able to work more hours.
The company reports that it is planning to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and public buildings throughout the country, less than 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start negotiations with the claimants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although the holiday season is still a few months away, the purchase season is closer, and companies are ready to hire temporary staff to have enough state in shops and to sell, download and supply goods.
Michael J. Fox is looking for a "study" with Princess Diana.
The film's "Back in the Future" premiere was a tremendous event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in a movie theater waiting for the royal family to arrive, I noticed that a place with me was free, and here I felt - a few with me is going to sit with Princess Diana," he said in a trailer near the screen with a documentary film "Back in time".
The film begins, and here I come to the point that I literally stand in the distance of my hand and in a false flower from the presence of Princess Welsh.
"Back in time" - a documentary film on "Back in the future" - includes interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the director of Robert earthquake and executive director Steven Spiilberg.
The president of the film Back in the future was 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spilberg, "it's, of course, the biggest movie of travel ever taken."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and some filmmakers in October.
The head of the United Nations states that the military decision does not exist in Syria
The Secretary-General, Mr. Ghi Mun, in response to Russia ' s military support for Syria, stated that, for almost five years of conflict, there is “no military solution”, and the increase in arms would only increase violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations called on all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gi Mün announced at the press conference in the middle that he was planning a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council, namely the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the council, as well as among the Syrian and local authorities, “have made the situation impossible”.
Mr. Ghi Mun urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity as they had demonstrated in the resolution of the Iran nuclear programme and in the review of the Syrian crisis.
8 The results of the survey showing that Donald Tramp is not running
Some have tried to bring him up as a lawyer.
The others got away from him, I took it as a joke.
And some ask for scandals.
However, as some Republicans try to overcome the high position of Donald Trampa as a result of the investigations, they fail (peace).
Ten of the last 11 national reviews have shown the advantage of Donald Tramp in two significant figures, and some have begun to ask thoroughly what this means for the magic of mobility in terms of the chances of obtaining nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of a chosen cycle.
Neither does it mean that the Tempp has the chance to designate the Republican Party.
The experts point out that at the time, in 2011, Rick Perry had adopted its predominance to the population of Germany, none of whom had joined a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would become a universal election.
But external groups, such as the Supreme Political Action Committee, Jacob Bush, and the Economic Conservative Group of the Growth Club, recognize the unsatisfying force of the Trump and begin to deliver their dollars to cover it.
Here are some of the numbers of surveys that speak of what they are capable of being immutable - not just an intermediate phase:
The streaming of symptoms for Trupa was 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Tramp announced his application in mid-June, a study at the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 republics had a positive attitude toward this magnet in the area of mobility.
By the middle of July, it was 40 per cent.
It was 52 per cent early in August.
Six of the 10 Republicans are now positive about Donald Trampu.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are above the initial stages.
The question Quinnipiac in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of the Republicans there were positive links to the Trip.
Two thirds of the votes in favour of the GOP would set up the Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey carried out last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said they were either "with another", or "with satisfaction", if Trip had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "stirred" if he'd become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trip (43 per cent say that they would be "on the other hand" against 40 per cent of those who say the same about Trip).
Next in the east?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say they will be "not satisfied" or "damaged" if they like the stationman Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most of the Republicans do not consider the Temppa temperature to be a problem.
While the Trapa mass criticises its popularity and frustration, 52 per cent of voters from all over the country believe that there is a magic suitable temperature to be president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington post held on Monday.
The same figure is reflected in the first closed congregation in the state of Iowa, where 52 per cent of the Republicans believe that he is the only person who can be the principal commander, according to Quinnipic last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at the job, and almost six of the 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Electionrs of the Republicans tend to think that way.
When they hope for their clues, the Republican electors think that the Trump is a universe.
On the question of who was the most likely winner in the GOP appointment, 4 out of 10 said that the Tempp was a favorite, according to CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's not like four out of 10 put Jacob Bush at the end of July.
Full dispersion: The GOP voters had never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romani.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trusted Trap campaign.
Even if the Republicans were to stand around the other candidate, the Tranquil continued to stand in front of all the others.
Some indications indicate that such a breakdown is more likely to be a priority for the Trap, while not supporting the Trap is equally distributed among the more than ten other candidates.
However, a study conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical merger between the ‘one on the one hand’ between the Trump and most other candidates, the Tempp almost always receives support from the majority.
He controls Carly Fiorino at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jacob Bush at 19 points and, finally, Randa Paula, John Kesic and Chris Cristi at 33 points.
He's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to deal with?
Ben Carson charged businessmen with a total of 19 items in the hypothetical conspiracy "one-on-one".
More than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've been thinking.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the votes in support of the Trampa are said to be trusted in their votes.
Obviously, many can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never thinks.
46 per cent said they left the door open for other candidates.
However, the most intense competition in Trump at the moment is with a colleague of the neurosurgery surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they thought they were going to choose Trampa.
Six of the 10 republics say they agree with the Immigration Treaty.
Since two months ago, Donald Tramp called immigrants from Mexico “strengtheners” in his statement opening the campaign, the issue of immigration became the most relevant in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that the Trompa service will open up the key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican party and mix the referendum.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans said that they agreed with the Trump on immigration.
Thus, until immigration is of general interest, it seems that Donald Tramp remains in the same position.
Disillusionment by the Government collects new traffic.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson are now considering supporting approximately half of the electoral voters, mainly because of their author status.
Six of the 10 republics in the new ABC/Post survey on Monday said that they wanted a political author rather than a man with the experience of working in the Government.
And they're also charged with Washington.
The question of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent "not satisfied", and 21 per cent "in the light".
The Government will decide on the index of pensions in October.
Vice-President of RF Olga Goldec stated that the Government is now seeking options for the implementation of the law on pension indexation in 2016 at the actual level of inflation.
She noted that the decision should be made by 8 October at the time of the draft budget for the next year in the Government.
In addition, the cabinet discussed the option of extending the decision to freeze the pension of Russians.
The hungry observed that the amount of pension savings amounted to 350 billion rubles.
It is estimated that the full amount of pensions will be indicated in the following year.
According to the vice-president, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
The hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not fair to pay for him.
Formerly, SMEs reported that there were two options for budget balance in the cabinet.
Why are they so popular and so beautiful?
The doctor-of-almologist Tiana Levashova answers:
Our century is a forest that protects the eyebrow from many small pieces that sit on it.
Having forgotten the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of bluff.
Simple output:
Not three eyes with red hands, wear c as a special linen jacket for a century;
do not take 1-2 times a day to clean the end of the century from those stored in it for the day of the valuables.
Cleaning procedures must be complemented with warm compressions with openings of medical tract (salphes, romans) that consume the thick secretion of the railways, and then the mass of the ends of the century, which should be carried out by round movements of fingers;
Don't use any anti-locks.
They dry and dry up the skin and help to make the secret of the salt irons more attractive.
Phenyan claims that the Korean nuclearists have created an atom bomb.
North Korea's authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country is a nuclear complex in Johannesburg, working "in full power".
This was reported on the country's website of the Central Telegram Agency.
It is noted that the CDC is ready to respond at any time to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States”, and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and in quality”.
The last nuclear testing was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, there have been no reports of the reactor ' s plans for reassessment of its full-valued work since then.
He claims he's been able to create an atom bomb.
Also, the CNDR has not repeated tests of medium and small distance rockets, writes polt.ru.
Jirinowski had to remove from the Russian gymnasium a mention of the brothers.
The LDR leader Vladimir Jirinowski believes that the national school should remove the mention of the association of the brothers.
He said this at the Lord's meeting, reporting to the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long game, the longest in the world, not even sportsmen," said Jirinovski.
The delegation considers that it is necessary to remove all quadrilaterals containing this string:
In 2014, Jirinovski stated that the current film had to be referred to "God, the King of Food", and the Russian tricycle to replace the imperial flag, says polt.ru.
Assad called on all the forces to unite in combating terrorism.
Syrian President Bar Assad called on all forces to join in combating terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not whether Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but it is necessary to address the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans want to judge refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the question of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible until people are killed, until blood transfusions continue and people feel completely secure.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't achieve anything until we win terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Remember, about 500 thousand migrants, including from Syria, have arrived in the country of the Euro-Union this year.
The Eurocommission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since World War II.
There may be thousands of combatants from the Islamic State group coming to Europe.
The members of the terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city set up a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany has become a host of refugees, although it has recently attempted border control to keep them under control.
According to the authorities, some 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call a significant number.
Since September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Correspondent Bi-bi-si Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, where migrants were given a warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbin deplores the Prime Minister ' s session
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debate at the session of the Prime Minister is expected to be very patience
The new leader of the Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon take the first floor at the Prime Minister's session, for the first time by force with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin spoke with the first of the six issues raised in the second half of the day; he said that the press and members of the parliament would soon be closely monitored by the Liberian Party.
He called the less theatre and more facts on a weekly demonstration.
He also stated that he might miss some meetings by leaving them with his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary trial of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will be held after appointment of the tennis court and his words at the annual Tread Union Congress on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the Liberians to stand silent during a national exercise on Tuesday, while the 75-year-old Batwa for Britain was criticised by a number of conservative members of Parliament and was the subject of a number of advanced articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to ask for a public game drew attention
Mr. Corbina, Press Secretary, said that he was "suppressively silent" and recognized the "Heroism of the Royal VVS in Bitwe for Britain".
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the tennis club, informed BBC 2, that he would advise the leader of the lobbyists of five national “independence” against his conviction that he needed the removal of the monarchy.
Almost ten tankers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's command, calling for differences in economic, defence and international policy, while at least one sixth of the members of the parliament were supported as leader.
Political Correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "copyed" in the lobbying party after Mr. Corbin has been appointed to office in the European Union and limited to the Government of Compensation Payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Trad-Union Conference that the Leiborist Party had made amendments aimed at eliminating the most general idea of restrictions.
Several hours later, Mr. Smith, the Minister for Labour and Pensions said that there was a "full clarity" in the party because it was opposed only to Government plans to cut the ceiling from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth Leborist leader with whom David Cameron will meet in the "Court Hall" for the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the lobbyists, who promised another policy approach, said that he was “accessing collective resources” in order to get Mr. Cameron's ideas and receive more than 30,000 proposals.
Members of Parliament from the Yilington North said that the issues of the Prime Minister had raised a great deal of controversy, and that he would also refrain from responding and sharing the quantities, rather than promising to focus on such serious issues as poverty, inequality and the problems faced by youth.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economics at the Ten Commandments, would place him on the question of the Prime Minister when he was absent, for example, when Mr. Cameron was outside the border.
He also called for the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had called on the House of Commons of John Berk to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to leave the political style of the "remote baling" often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted several years later that he had failed.
Since the first transition in 1990, the issues of the Prime Minister have become the key indicator of leadership, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputations of other Members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a caricature and requires massive reforms.
"Out of Yoburg" The Homeless Young People Who Learn From the Photos
The Johannesburg Business Centre is a complex place for homeless people.
However, one group of former unattended people found a way to clean up and earn a living.
"I've been taken off in Yoburg" is a non-profit study that teaches homeless young people to take photos of the cross and work on it.
BBC News met with one of the first dropouts of the project.

Sterling's pounds grow to the extent that payments are made in Britain
The interest on the growth fund was paid in Britain, while the FTSE 100 index was raised thanks to the proposal to buy SABMiller.
Since June, the number of bonuses increased by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period of the previous year.
The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009, and it has been met as a transfer to a more early period of forecasting for the possible growth of cotton.
The sterling rate grew by over 1 per cent in respect of the dollar and amounted to $1,555 and 0.84 per cent in respect of the euro, amounting to €1,3730.
FTSE index 100 increases to 6229.21 to 1.49 per cent.
In general, SABMiller shares were distributed, which increased by 20%, thanks to the offer of purchase from the AB InBev competitor.
The deal would unite the world's two largest beer companies, collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry shares increased by 0.9 per cent to the source of encouraging news from the competing group of producers of the Richemont luxury class.
The latest sales data by Richemont took over all expectations and showed that sales in China, on the key market for Burberry, began to grow again.
The Glencore shares grew by 5 per cent after the top-ranking giant claimed that it had received $2.5 billion by placing the shares that had been made under the debt reduction strategy.
The World Book Production and Packaging Teams were indexed by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to "sale".
JD Sports has grown after the company reported an 83 per cent increase in salary for a period of up to 46.6 million pounds.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can mix expansion.
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Caugill says that increasing the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing capacity in potential consumers' arms".
It is unlikely, however, that such purchasing capacity will increase the cost of labour, he says.
Costs could have an impact on the JD Sports expansion plan, adding that it could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching an initiative-based campaign to fight the Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The open-label food supplier for the initiative launched an IGA market-protection campaign in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the current impact of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two optimum warehouses and the first 120 stores in South and West Australia in the beginning of the following year, the supermarkets of Metcash and IGA strengthen relations with local food suppliers and advance the brand IGA through marketing in leading media and social networks and in the "Adelaide Show" type activities.
The campaign is accompanied by IGA trailers and suppliers, such as the manufacturer of the sink Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers a discount in IGA stores, and the owners of shops selling tickets to the football league in South Australia.
It is expected that Metcash will reveal more details of its strategy of protection on 29 September, the day when this opportunistic supplier of food, spirit drinks and agricultural products will be conducting its annual day of investor strategy.
There was little money for the horse, since in South Australia and Western Australia, the IGA stores are nearly 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show a higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as normal routes, so the market here is more favourable for IGA rivals than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the U.S. and 24 per cent in the WA compared to about 14 per cent in the East.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will lose 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first shops, taking the amount of access to all the games in attendance, but mainly to independent players.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley, an analyst, Tom Kirat, believes that IGA can lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, with sales of 500 million and 600 million dollars on these markets respectively.
The loss of income and sales of food at the high level of the permanent costs of Metcash may amount to around 13 million companies prior to the payment of interest and taxes, said Mr. Kiratt.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey revealed that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could be very likely to disappear during the decade.
The Metcash company refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas ' s comments.
However, the Board of Directors of Metcash is expected to have been in contact with Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA on the market decreased from 18 to 14 per cent in 2010, while Metcash's income from the food business, which the company placed on about 1200 IGA growers, fell to 43 per cent as a result of the operational depletion and the pressure on sales and profitability indicators.
However, the company does not pay more than $150 million a year to compare the price differences with the prices in Cole and Woolworths per thousand positions per week and to help IGA refurbishes in the construction of the trading venues, as well as to offer a rapidly increasing assortment of fresh products and a wider choice of food products.
The Director-General of Metcash Ien Morris said that the price comparison and refurbishment of the trading venues would take place and that the company was expected to increase the net income in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakisa supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilli
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves a start, not a criticism of his conduct.
Tanasi Kokkinakis suddenly suffered in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kirjos, and for his behavior, he deserves more than criticism, as President Tennis Australian Steve Hill said.
Cockkinakis, a young man in a talented mind and often called "Special Ks", was at the centre of attention because of the late fall of Cyrus with Stan Wavrinka on the Tournament of Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a campaign of qualifications in Cincinnati, the judge had to divorce Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, and said, "The fight was to be put on Cyrus's lap, and I must put this guy's ball on it."
C As soon as Kokkinakisa was last seen by a shooting rocket after a judge in his leg rescued Risar Gaske from possible assault on the US Open, Hilli was told to protect Kokkinakis.
Youth is currently in Glazgo, meeting with Sam Grotto for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal of Cuba, Dweiss against Britain.
"I'm really going through one thing, namely, that Tanasi was involved in the conflict," said Hilli.
He really broke a rocket when he had a foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first game that stole a rocket when hopes broke, and I know Tanasi's good enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he has been very well in enough provocation in the United States, with Harrison and so on, and I am sure he deserves trust.
He's surrounded by a great team, a beautiful family, and I just think he's been a little dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's working very hard, he's a great team, he's never had any problems with other games, he's respected outside the court, he's trained very intensively, he's a highly targeted and developed young man, and I think he should be valued.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Cyrus for an important fight that started on Friday, believing that “a compromise” was the right outcome for everyone, but considering that a man from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus its full attention on the mother rather than the quarrels around [Cyrios]," said Hilli.
And I think Nick took the power very fast that people of the type of Federer and Marrey are showing up, he's growing up in public, he's making some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him figure out the consequences of his actions, and I think that I need to take him out of the center for some time so he can think about them, and that's better for the team and the best for him.
The migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces the emergency situation, closes the border, stops migrants
On Tuesday, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the south-east and stopped those who were trying to escape from the country illegally in order to stop the flow of migrants.
Hundreds of migrants had been crossing the border, and Serbian authorities had reacted badly.
In an uncertain time on the road between the two-country checkpoints, people who fled from armed violence to their families broke down and based on it.
However, disappointment grew.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, the migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and cried out to the Hungarian police for a special assignment.
Some of the protesters refused food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they were more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem rather than the resulting harm.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries on the next day," Ivica Dachic said in Prague.
Volunteers at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the following day after a block from 28 countries were unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to hold a common responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in repatriated Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) that the Member States of the Union would have another 120 000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
Germany's Chancellor Angel Merkel and Austria were required to collect a Euro-Union special summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis, which covered the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope to act quickly by Brussels or by its neighbours.
The emergency situation announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to open their way and speed up judicial cases of asylum delivery.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Syerto, said that his country was also planning to bring a ban from the border to Romania to cover the flow of migrants through the country, now that it ended the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dugata reported that even prisoners had been subjected to urgent work after the closing of the barrier between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months Hungary has become the main "stairs" and the crossing point of the Euro-Union border for immigrants, many of which are refugees - victims of war in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban of the country insists that most of the arrivals in the country are economic migrants who seek a better life, not refugees, who are victims of war acts that have the right to protection, and this point of view is very much on the opinions of other EU countries, namely Germany.
The new laws entered into force in Hungary on the whole are now considered to be a crime to cut or damage 4-metre (13-foot) memory from the colloquium built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia and include longer prison terms for persons charged with trafficking.
"Because of the situation resulting from mass migration, the Hungarian Government announced an emergency situation," said the representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovač in the southern city of Seged.
We clearly understand: illegal cross-border crossing is crime.
The formal parliament must still sanctions the deployment of military forces, which is expected for the next week, but the Associated Press reporters who are on the border have been watching the presence of armed soldiers to the teeth of vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Dérd Bakondi, Orban National Security Adviser, reported that 45 persons who tried to cross the border were arrested by the competent authorities and 15 others within the country.
They crossed the border, broke the court, were now under police custody and accused of administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are quick to rebuild the church.
The Hungarian authorities also shut down two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, calling for one of the crossings to be blocked by a railway train surrounded by a train.
Unordered passage through the border of the city of Ríoskea (Vengria) was the result of the laying-down of a service space for people to pass inside the metal containers, and the crowd had given one another to break in.
There were about 20 people to be found inside, while thousands of people were left out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would refuse food and water until they were left in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders was reduced twice in the national survey
Former vice-president Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double advantage in the country-wide nomination for democracy, but Senator Bernie Sanders has reached it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the primary democratic voters (up to 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up to 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential run, is supported by 15 per cent of the first democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the initial elections, most democratic voters said that they were too early to identify with the candidate they would support.
Clinton's parties are more confident in their election than in support of other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has received some bonus.
Clinton maintains a large advantage between women and those who have died, but that advantage has been reduced.
Her support for the men was significantly clouded, and Sanders stayed away from her at all 5 points.
The preference granted by Clinton to democratic voters up to 50 years has disappeared, and they are now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton defeated Sanders in a double-number of liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the leading democratic voters throughout the country say that they would have supported Clinton with enthusiasm if she had become a candidate for this party.
The fourth would support her with some reservations, and 15 per cent would only support her because she was a candidate.
Six per cent wouldn't support her.
It may be surprising that the current partners of Clinton, in particular, show greater enthusiasm for her account.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about four of them would support it with enthusiasm.
At the same time, 48 per cent of former democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, but the smaller number of Republican electors speak the same about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's parties are asked the open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular response - that she has the experience (16 per cent), then that she is now the president's time (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate at this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's partners also talk about the association that links it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called according to issues and opportunities for elections.
Since the vice-president is thinking of potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic electorate would like him to join the race, although the third believes he should not.
When asked who they wanted to see in the second place among the party's candidates, the first democratic voters in most cases called Byden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they would choose Baden second, more than Sanders.
If Bayden decides not to issue his candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase from 20 points to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see Clinton's candidate with the best chance of winning the overall elections; however, this figure has decreased by 78 per cent in the past month.
In this case, Bayden showed a high percentage of the second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that most importantly in the candidate, voters choose alternatives other than opportunities to be elected.
The same situation last month, none of the candidates for democratics or potential candidates were unacceptable nominations for these original voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some key characteristics among the original voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
A Bayden of all three is guided by honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in its leadership qualities.
Thirty per cent of former democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on this account.
First democratic voters are also generally considered to be similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Baiden.
In all of this, about four democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions about the personal mailbox of the email and the server of Hillary Clinton continue to be addressed by her Gossekretor, most early democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation and believe that this did not have a negative impact on their overall view of it.
But that's the whole other story in American society as a whole.
Half of the Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, but they are satisfied with only about a third.
The public's views on this were still divided in March shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that e-mail polls have nothing to do with their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their views have been distorted.
In particular, more than six of the 10 republics claim that their views on Clinton have been distorted.
Even though Clinton believes that voters are honest and worthy of trust from its party, this remains a problem for it among the registered voters in general: only 32 per cent consider it honest and worthy of trust, eight points below the previous month, and 15 per cent compared to the May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country are not considered to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good notes on leadership.
Six protested candidates from Baiden, Carson and Bush have shown a better result in honesty.
Most see in Sanders a more honest man than there is, but as for Carson, many have no idea about him.
The sample of errors for the election of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 per cent.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trampu
Ben Carson came suddenly to Donald Trampu at the latest CBS/New York Times
The two candidates took half of the voters' votes in the new round, leaving all the others looking for their feet.
The electorate throughout the country continues to support the Trappa mass, which has increased by 23 per cent in the recent CBS debate, which was launched by Fox News last month, up to 27 per cent in the debate held on Tuesday.
But Carson took the same period from 6 per cent to 23 per cent.
The questionnaire also showed that Carson was supported by all the demographic groups, who were depressed by Trampa in the electoral group of the Republicans with higher education.
The remaining candidates, except Carli Fiorina and Governor Ohojo John Kasic, have resigned together with Governor Wisconsina Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 per cent in the past month to 2 per cent.
Former Governor Floride Jab Bush, former Governor of Arcanzas Mike Hakabi and Senator of Florida Marko Rubio, have a third seat of 6 per cent.
An error in the election of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is 6 per cent plus 6 per cent, and the survey was held in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in surveys, showing 19 per cent of the population's support, with 32 per cent of the population.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post also showed that the Tramp was seriously in control of Carson.
In view of the increase in Carson's support last week, the Tramp made a number of critical findings in the address of the former neurosurgery, even when Carson apologized for his doubts about Trampa's faith.
"We need the energy," said Trump last Saturday while the campaign was closed in Iowa.
Five members of the brothers were charged with the death of Baruch's cousin.
About two years after the death of a student college during the funeral ritual in the mountains of the Pono, Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
"The members of the Pi Delta Psi brothers of the New York College Baruch were violently attacked by Michael Deng at the time of the September 2013 strike and did not give him time to the hospital, which led him to his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say that the student with a closed eye and a 30-pound ring with a back-up dog had been interpreted several times before he tried to achieve the goals of going on the surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the P.D.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.D.P.P.A.P.P.A.P.D.P.A.
They have, however, found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Mengo, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask the council, as told at the press conference of police chief Chris Wagner.
"At this point the members of the brotherhood began to transfer personal property, in fact, putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't save, and he ended up next morning.
According to the funeral report, Deng received a number of stupid headaches, cramps, and beads.
"So many families have suffered as a result of fraternal rituals, as at least one student dies every year since 1970," said Douglas Fairberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monro's jury was guilty of the third murder for the first five members.
Thirty other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against the news and crime.
“We would like to take responsibility not only for individual participants, but, if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or informally, so it is," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Collegiate Baruch prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
The increase in rates is due, and the market for bees is halted, the debt will grow, and the economy will fall in decline.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it'll take to get there, and how long it'll last.
In particular, history has little to say about time.
Reception took place 11 months after the first increase in rates and for all 86 months.
The severity of the Federal Reserve in rising rates is often, although not always, determined by the economic and financial response.
Therefore, the Administration of the Central Bank of the United States stresses that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise taxes and on how much adjustment is made.
In fact, a lot of changers are in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the entire scale of the increase is being exceeded.
“The first increase in the Federal Reserve with a global financial crisis will undoubtedly be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "results of money", said Julian Jassop, the leading international economic specialist in Capital Economics, in his comments to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to a more normal level, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is how some areas of the economy could react, depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last month or around the past month, the expectation of an increase in rates can lead to some degree of instability.
However, in increasing rates, the effects are not usually dramatic.
"It is unlikely that the income from the shares would be reduced to 12-24 months after the first jump, which is likely to reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank's analyses have said in a recent study of the increase in the Federal Reserve rates.
If the market has changed significantly over the last 35 years - about 14 per cent - in terms of increasing rates, it remains sufficient for 250 days (meaning 2.6 per cent) then, after 500 days, it is returned to normal with an average income of 14.4 per cent for the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main trading strategy specialist in the Nuveen Asset Management published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result of the book price has a tendency not to become more pronounced at the rate of increase, and the income from the shares has begun to decrease.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often help them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that have not existed before and could speed up the recession.
In particular, the raw domestic product will be located almost in its lowest point during the existence of an increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, only two times the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 per cent in 118 cases since 1950.
Even though he was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, he believed that it was a long time, while the third quarter held only 1.5 per cent of all of Atlanta Fed's data.
The increase in the rate of such a unstable economic background may be risky and raises the question “will this time be another time”, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to increase the rate of the Federal Reserve system throughout the year, with their view being directed towards the meeting of the Open Market Committee, which ends in Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in the rate at the meeting, Führer trade is only 25 per cent likely.
"In our 1950 study, all the rates increase cycles until today were in the supercircle of increasing financial flows in GDP, covering pre-reaction peaks very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst resuscitation in the chosen period.
The current cycle at this point is the longest that the Federal Reserve System has expected since the end of the final review; the record has been 35 months, and it has been 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expected to increase rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is implemented for shares.
The main difference is that the effect is faster than that of actions when the Federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of conditions it appears that income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/reduction of the rate in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle, the rate of return is rapidly falling," reports Deutsche.
Specialists on the Charles Schwab strategy believe that increasing rates will lead to a close approach to long-term and short-term income levels by doing more serious damage.
High income obligations often lead to a better climate, although "we're still afraid of income fluctuations," says a study by Katie Jones, an analysis of fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Johns believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system's policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and lower inflation expectations, there is evidence that the market has been geared towards a more rigorous monetary policy”, she wrote.
The percentage rates for short-term loans have been raised, owing to higher revenues, increased credit advances, and increased flexibility - all market characteristics in the federal system ' s policies.
In general, companies leading their major business in the United States benefit from increased interest rates and local production becomes more attractive.
International debt companies will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their production more expensive in the world market and more expensive in financial terms.
"The history shows that "quality" actions demonstrate the efficiency of the above market within three months of initial increase," Goldman Sachs reported to customers.
Firms with stable financial status combined the company with the unstable situation as a result of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 in the middle of 5 per cent.
High-income companies as well as low-voltility shares have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, averaged at 4 (percent) and 3 (percent) respectively.
The debt will be a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of debt with a floating rate lose much more, says Goldman.
In addition to net cash transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
The contributors could also see profits through higher income, although experts are concerned about how quickly this will take place.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," said Member of parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham critically criticised the standard reduction station
Proves that it is becoming less than a commercial competitor
Also focused on BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just in line with Brits.
Member of Parliament, Damien Collins, who violated The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said the leader of parliament, encouraging the television company to prove that it does nothing that commercial companies do.
Parliamentary member Andrew Bingham also announced the BBC leadership, which seems to be the public radio station "glupet" and is becoming less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
It also focused on the BBC Music Awards Awards held last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- here's two examples that first came to my mind that you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charge, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was going far ahead of his commercial opponent when it came to live music and audition.
Because I know that with Radio 3, I don't know classical music anymore.
And his devotion to live statements and the creation of music in fact is no longer equal to anyone.
"It is also very important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in seeking new music and in promoting new production," he said.
Earlier this year, the BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy claimed that radio stations should work much more to attract audiences than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child who was attacked by five commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of the Parliament of Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical show of talent that BBC purchased at the Dutch Talpa Media for a price of 22 million pounds.
See why this programme is often discussed with regard to the lack of originality and outstanding figures?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC show 1, in which Paul Fate and Boy George participate as judges, was made in the typical BBC style.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "get a hit in his own house" next time she was going to launch an exciting project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of the new season The Voice in the future or the use of money by those who pay the licence collection to other entertainment formats.
The Internet sales growth has peaked in August, and the wine may be the Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, an increase in online sales was observed at seven per cent
Last month saw the most slow growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales were activated three years ago through the use of mobile equipment for shopping
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could help prevent trauma
For some ten years, virtual shopping has been tested by a bomb turning many central streets in Britain into a city-town.
However, experts say that there has now been evidence of online sales imbalances after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase over the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August has shown a minimum growth since they began to figure out in 2000, increasing by only five per cent.
Experts say that there has now been evidence of online sales imbalances after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase over the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the pace of growth in the previous years and return to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkjai, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales had been activated three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This means that more and more people have been able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, for example, by sitting on a couch.
But now it's going to go to bed, and you can see a decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying an event that took place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, the buyers in the number of mediums have increased five times more to computers to make good use of offers, thus ruining a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers entered this battle for profitable purchases, could prevent people from jumping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, about 1 pound of stellings per 5 pounds are spent online.
With regard to products such as television and star cars, more than one third of them are sold via the Internet.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and shoes online than in fashion shops in central streets.
Muslims buried the wounded in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and the Ben Laden family was sentenced to sanctions
The Muslims carry 29 dead bodies on the streets, as the first burials begin in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 persons were also injured in total post-cranial injuries
Hundreds of Muslims have gone to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who have been killed as a result of the carnage in the capital of Mecca.
The women, mostly in white, who were present at the funerals, were filled with a passage to pay the tribute to the first of the victims who were sent on their last trip to Al-Moaissem camp.
The main process went through the holy place, where the former building wall broke down and fell to the ground a few days earlier.
The bodies were released for burial, while King Saudi had destroyed a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family, which also had 394 people injured.
29 bodies of corpses killed in the destruction of the skull in the Main Room carried on the streets
Among the victims was the father of the four children of Kasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first romantic trip when he broke his neck.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Chamber with his parents prior to the start of the annual pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hague in Mexico will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the bullet of the crane on the ground of the unemployed.
The Arab version of the decree published by the Public Agency Saudi Press states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of breach.
The English edition of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company's leaders had been prevented from going beyond the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to explain the reason for the fall of the cow in the main chamber, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered to go to the Hague this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the damage of the skin, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also charged the company with the non-use of modern security measures and inappropriate arrangements of action with the metrologic service.
Ten of the cranes are surrounded by the Main Mekki Temple, within the scope of the extensive construction work carried by Binladin Group.
The family of Ben Laden has been part of the immediate ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is guided by larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden was the son of the family who was expelled in 1990.
The accident took place in heavy winds and was expected for a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom to participate in the ceremony, which was mandatory once in life for every hard Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 remained in the hospital.
Officials have decided to pay one million rents (about 174,000 dollars) to relatives who have lost, and the same amount will not be recovered.
The remaining injured will receive half that amount.

Author: Rupert Steiner, City Correspondent Daily Mail
It is said that the British are reimbursing milk and maladies, and instead they hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do domestic work
If you're able to walk with a kid or a boat to clean up the walls, it's like you're at least in our day.
Because, according to B&Q, British masters are increasingly demanding teachers to perform housework.
Veronica Lori, the new Director-General of the Kingfisher, who has the household equipment network, reported that this trend is a major attraction for qualified teachers from Eastern Europe who offer minimal services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in master goods and to close 60 B&Q stores simultaneously.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q stores, as eight out of ten decisions on purchases in the store were taken by weak gender representatives.
Most of the staff are now men.
She said that it should not be noted that the latest demographic trends, characterized by increasing the number of households belonging to the same women, who are more involved in the construction of their homes than in the past.
Ms. Lory said: "In our shops, men are still working very well.
There is a need to take steps to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on acquired goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in the role of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, has also changed the composition of the team of top managers, which has reached the level of directors of both men and women.
Kingfisher is hardly the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director-General and the Director-General for Finance.
Ms. Lori said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women in the Board of Directors was difficult.
After the group had incurred the cost of closing shops, the Kingfisher company showed a decrease in revenue and sales for the year.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores.
Time of decision on the percentage rate of the United States Reserve
The World monitors the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discusses the most important decision for two days - to raise or have no percentage for the first time in the last decade.
The question of 80 economists, conducted by Reuters, found that some more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would come up with this, now believe that it would still be timely and maintain the rate at the current range of 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we agree that the main bank can move from a zero note and start the process of normalizing interest rates," Anhel Killed, an official of the Peterson International Economic Institute, said.
The United States economy works effectively, and economic growth adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet, while inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared to change, but all of them were convinced that all chances of such a move were opposed.
The decision will be announced at 20 a.m. CET Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" - hundreds of refugees are scanning Horgosh's checkpoint at the Serbian-Venger border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for immigrants.
The asylum seekers have already begun to expand other routes in the Eurojust.
One of them is on a closed border with Serbia through Romania.
Secondly, through Croatia and Slovenia, Austria.
According to some data, buses that have taken refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now being sent to the city of Shido at the Croatian border.
The leaders were ordered by the authorities to follow without delay.
Serbia's Minister for Internal Affairs of Nebojs Stéanovic assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our work is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure a human relationship with them.
But this is already a problem in Europe.
To solve it simply, no country in Europe is going to do it alone, and so a smaller country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban has been constantly saying:
If a person is called a refugee, he must fill in Serbia the documents necessary for that purpose.
And if he doesn't, they won't let him in our country, because Serbia is completely safe.
Hungary has already brought 175-circuit border crossings with Serbia.
But Orban remains unintended: he plans to bring the same damage to Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meymarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
For a number of years, Vangelis Meymarakis had joined the right-wing government, which, in the view of the left, had led the country into the financial crisis.
Now he became a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, breaking the Cyprus challenge.
A few days before the election, he met a journalist named Euroonius.
Euronius: Mr. Maymarakis, please welcome to Euronius!
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a humiliating defeat by the SIRIZA coalition, but now, the judge on the excuse, "New Democracy" compared it with its popularity.
What's changed in this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Zipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget and an economic growth perspective.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Cipras passed them.
In the past nine months, Greece had been able to assess the situation in which the country was in January and Mr. Cyprus ' s false promises.
And now they can easily compare what has been promised to happen.
The daily life was much worse than January when the situation improved, with most Greek citizens doing so.
Euronius: But you say that in the event of the election victory, you will seek alliances with other parties, including CIRIZ.
Vangelis Meymarakis: The fact that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that, in all other countries where the programmes of salvation, political forces and all the parties are still in operation, they have gathered together in order to implement the programme they have agreed not to reject from their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that the cooperation of political forces and institutions will only at present allow the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you fulfill this agreement, or will you try to change it at least?
Hungarian Maymarakis: In fact, we voted for the movement of Greece on the European road, as we are well aware of the harmful effects that would have on the EU's exit.
Europe now helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, the Hungarian package and the banking sector assistance.
All of this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current serious economic measures have been the result of Mr. Cipras ' s negotiation.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wants to arrange for the first year, it is reasonable to realize that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, I am convinced that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession can be a subject of negotiations again, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we can return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their confidence, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, and continue to benefit from EU funding and large investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have clarified by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not about fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed earlier.
We were told that the ministers of Cyprus never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed, so they failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronius: If you win the election, you will soon meet one table with Mr. Younger, the Netherlands, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them is different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried to implement the 2012 agreement with severe angles.
We've made progress in reform.
Of course, we did not understand the urgency and urgency needed, but we acted in urgent circumstances.
The market fell, and there was no evidence of potential buyers who were willing to pay the price of the Greek Government.
I was a speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree with the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then composed of the majority of the Government.
Despite their serious ideological differences on key legislative projects, we have been working in Parliament, with populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that have taken place.
And we have been able to lead the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the recent general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronius: The last week on the territory of Greece is the mass flow of refugees.
What do you think of the situation and the reaction of the European countries in which these people are seeking?
Vangelis Meymarakis: Crisis with refugees is a bomb of slow action with which we must have a case after the election victory.
The reason for the failure of the Government of Syria to act in this situation is as follows.
Such issues should be addressed because only emergency measures remain if you have a problem.
And now we're in this situation.
Even the temporary Government, which changed Siriz, has done more than seven days in the past seven months by Mr. Cipras.
I am sure that these actions of the interim Government, which provides valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will allow for a decision.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that occurred with them.
This is a deeply humanitarian issue, and we will maintain the position that European policies should adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at EU summits, and the United Nations should be included.
We also need better coordination of action, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Euronius: Mr. Maymarakis, thanks for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Držkovka Donetsk, during the course of the criminal investigation, the Chief Military Administration of the Field, together with the military opposition, set up and detained a suspected 34-year-old Ukrainian military officer from the town of Kryvo Rog (Dnepropetrovs' area), who was attacked by night in joint use of spirit drinks, and the conflict that occurred in the village of the Upper Yasinovat region of Donetskina, was fired from the car in its attack.
A report on the injury of 22-year-old boy was received from a hospital where he was hospitalized with swaths of gunfire.
As Artem Vasicki, Deputy Chief of Criminal Investigation of the Military Chief of Police, has said, during the operational actions of law enforcement, the figure has shown the presence of another serious criminal offence -- the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.

Two other convicted persons were sentenced to 14 and 18 months imprisonment.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirska recognized four towns guilty of vandalism against Lenin's memorials, which were located on the territory of the CPRF and on the streets of Tricata, as well as the monumental monumental complex of the Mount of Slava.
In the latter case, there was a rocket installation of Katusha and T-34 tank.
We remember, on the night of December 12th, in the Russian Novosibirsk, the war machine of the Ukrainian flag was decorated by the monument of Slav.
A citizen's wife, Eugenia Irina Leonova, was born to the seventh child.

The man who discovered the shooting at the University of Delta left a note of apology
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague the same day - Shennon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was "possessed" about his first murder and would like to "all back," the competent authorities reported on Tuesday.
The police in the city of Gothia, Mississippi, reports that the teacher of geography and public science at the University of Delta called 911 in service about 10 hours in the morning.
On Monday, he reported that he shot someone.
Lamb told the inspector that the police had to send people home to him.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a dog in the house, which "no one's running," but probably was upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
The bomb didn't explain why he opened the gun.
When I arrived at the crime scene, the police found Amy Prentiss, 41, and a 45-year-old note by Lamba, saying: "I'm sorry I want to go back all the way back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
I wrote a note, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night when the police surrounded him, he ended up with him.
The director of the University of William Laforz reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lambo and Schmidt, but "in Mr. Lamba there was obviously something in mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb had proposed a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services on Tuesday reported that there was “no information or evidence” of a “love triangle”.
The Prentiss called out as the "best man" Sean O'Stin, who reported having been married to her for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin said that he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and that she was "inexhaustible."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "friends."
According to Lindsey Noulz, whose newspaper San Gerald calls his close friend Prentiss, the last one worked from house to house on the Internet.
Noulz said Prentiss had a pet on the Lating ring, and she had met Lambo for about three years.
Noulz said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday some time to say, "He won't go to jail."
The same night, when the police arrived at six "1" near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, escaped into the woods, and shot there.
According to a survey at the university site, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a degree in pedagogical science at the University of Delta.
Stars That Have Lost Their Success
Acter (left), on the photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought a leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year life satellite Farru Fosset, who died of cancer.
It is reported that the actor also suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008.
All of this, of course, played its part.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United has been elected for a few months since the double revolution.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places at the time of the League of Championships, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Indonesia.
While a protectionist survives this, which is why he will not be able to go to the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The trauma occurred during the indiscriminate subjugation of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw was in the PSV zone.
They helped him in the field for nine minutes and gave him oxygen before he could get into the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double break, and he's in the hospital."
They'll take him to Manchester tomorrow or tomorrow, and then they'll proceed.
It's horrible -- young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome great difficulties, and started playing fantastically, and this happened.
It had a oxygen mask on it.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's in six months, and the guy can't play in a group phase.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Moreno said he didn't get a nice card and no panels were assigned.
Architect Nicole Richcoly didn't order a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge has made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's a pen and a beautiful card.
It was a very bad bag with two legs.
She writes in her Twitter: "Thanks to all of your messages, not to describe how I'm tired, my way to recovery begins, I'm going to go back stronger than it was."
More on the subject: Manchester United survives the accident with Luke Shaw in the PSV game
The protection of English will be further encouraged to adjust to the European Championship in France next June.
Philip Koku, a PSV trainer, said, "It's a very heavy trauma."
When any game comes up with such a trauma, it's all very disturbing.
It was never the intention of our games to defeat the enemy.
Moreno took over his feet when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gale at the 2014 Peace Championship.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't intend to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's very heavy trauma, you feel bad," said Koku.
I didn't have a chance to see myself.
The only thing I could see was the sword that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moren) was wearing it, but I didn't see the bottom of Luke.
In a meeting with SBS6 Moreno, he said, "I know it's like, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm so sorry, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado from the PSV was also sent to the hospital after his encounter with Chris Smolling.
Did David Cameron know anything else about Loracse?
Each parent takes one thing very quickly: if your child has a book, it will take some time before you get to know her almost.
Let's see if you're not just David Cameron.
In response to the question of the representative of the company involved in the child recovery organization in Canicula, the Prime Minister selected Lorox, an environmental statement written by the Union in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment published on the company's SuperCamps website, and he continued: "This is a happy, threesome, unusual story with a strong message, I like to read to my children, because it always contains some form or message we pass on."
And it would be good, except for the last paragraph in which Cameroon is supposed to re-examine the content of the book, but in fact, it relates to the combination of the same film, which was released in 2012, with new personnel and details added to diversify a sufficiently short original introduction.
"In the high walls of the city of Wemnnuzville, where there was no green and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted is hoping to kiss the heart of Audrey - a girl of his dream, fulfilling her desire - to see this tree," we read in the text a description of a love story that was unknown to Dr. Susz (now Theodor Siegel), who died in 1991.
If that seems not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a short presentation of the Lorks film, published on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city of Wemnuzville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted is hoping to break the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as an active parent in general, is so ignorant of the book that a boy named he knows how to destroy the environment of a wild-smoker and a wild-smoker named Nahoquins, despite the protests of Loraks (the name of the book) is a funny substance with all who “speak on behalf of the trees”.
More recently, such an impeccable PR mission was commissioned by a performer, never reading a book about Loracs 20 times.
The representative of Dahn-Stret said that the text had been received from the Cameroon office in the electoral district.
The SuperCamps company confirmed that the text was received from Cameroon, but further comments did not follow.
For Adam Lita, there was apparently a risk not to fall into England, but it's still a complex issue.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the re-examination of the three-0 test series, which happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn't have excluded the victory in my field either.
Alister Kuka's command may have been less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are games in which the attackers have virtually taken the sword, and the collective thought is strong; they will not bring reproach from 2012 but only the youth's position.
Moen Ali's sword is turned into a bowl that gives rounds, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attack option.
More on the theme: Adam Litt from England's collection of test criticism and replaced by Alex Heilz
The decision to exclude Adam Lita from me, his principal trainer in Yorkshire, would be difficult to analyse.
His seven test mothers had had two good attacks in difficult circumstances, but apparently, but the harsh reality of the gambling in credulity was assessed by the judges.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, that led to this announcement, because (and I said this earlier) games are better chosen for themselves.
A couple of minutes ago, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in his own jurisdiction.
Let's hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The chief trainer of the collection of England, Trevor Baileys, had a good voice of his attitude, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he was first of all a team game, and then everything else.
The question, how much time will it take before a smart test cry leaves an impression - a complex question.
Lyt played seven games like Sam Robson to him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on the outside.
The only thing you could regret is that England chose Jonathan Tritt for the Caribbean Prime Minister when Lite was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity in the past.
There's Alex Hills, and he's a smart man I appreciate very much.
He's an unforeseeable cricket who we saw in the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he hired 236 in a fight against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
At least he should be given the same opportunity as those before him, but that would, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
I wish to put Moena along with Kuko as an open-minded creature, which would give me the opportunity to put on an additional back-up, keeping four fast-paced balls, and I'm not at all against it.
I don't see why the former game can't get the sword back there, but this left-wing showed that he's a pretty good cricket.
Moen, maybe not all that is needed for his own Woostershire graph, but it's a third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old partner on the team, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test mats with a "third smartman" before going out as an opener in 2001.
He won three hundred immediately and didn't look.
Zafar Ansari comes to the congregation as a reserve speaker, and with my short association, he showed me to a very promising young man.
People can look at his example statistics -- on average 31 with a bit and 35 with a sword -- and think that it's a risk factor, but among the backbones of the voter a little bit, and choose the youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a package of practical supplements in training.
The appointment of Mahel Jaauordin, a Sri Lankan scholar, as a test mother consultant could be a master step.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which brings to it the richest experience gained under all possible circumstances and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the game where white swords are used, and will provide both the energy and the unprecedented pace in the set.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in the international circle, whether it is a game or a training work, and like Mahela, he has little intelligence.
Sometimes new votes in the dividend, even if they say what has already been said, may give new forces to the team.
Mr. Collie, on the command of Darema Ben Stokes, has been left alone for one day, Ruth has been given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I am not, for example, trying this problem.
Although not all agree with this, coaches and players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember how toys, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The UK exit camp in the Euro-Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unintended policy on the renewal of the negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU every day is facing more difficulties, even without the choice of generic Jeremy, "Yes or No?" -- Corbin of the Leborist Leader or the non-TUC on Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and the Best Faraj.
A friendly European diplomat explained that the situation in which the EU is currently experiencing various crises is not all of its own production - some of the countries parties are on the threshold of the British egocentric report of the current breakdown of agreements and the disruptive arrangements they do not primarily wish.
At an annual meeting in Briton, TUC decided that it would not want them in any case if they were to break down social protection.
We could even call it "Dieva and George's programmer."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are filmed at the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographed on the background of a known local monument, in or without local landmarks, then visited the house and said that they were attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wishes to be interested in maintaining British external contacts under the Euro Union, says Berlin, "Don't leave us together with France," suggests that inspired ministers and officials in some capitals come to understand when everything is going to be equal, we will stay or eat.
Angel Merkel, a very careful German Chancellor, is a Union, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation for her is worse than she's missed for those who are in her place of Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16).
The head of France, France, will be preceded by a change or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon receive the Nationalist Government of the Right, Spain, to the left.
It is difficult to see their skin-red out to help the selfi-brits, whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland's exit from Great Britain - which they also do not want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to release a deliberately useless note-type SNP during the 2017 UK referendum campaign in order to boost the UK's EU exit process, my friend suggested.
"Review has been an idea-fix" and "British has received nothing valuable from renewed negotiations."
Europeans are aware of what the Flyt Street can be, and how sceptically the EU has been set up with media magnets, unlike Tony Benn's runtime in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 compared to 2:1.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the late Europorter, who celebrated his "true EU bananas" by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his folly, Ed Millibund knew who his enemies were.
They included a company in which fear - inspiring tributes, telephone hackers, and pseudo-residents, who hold most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same idea about them perfectly, but he told himself that when you're in a battle-gun cell, you should give her bananas to take her away and not give her your lunch on the couch again and again with tea.
In fact, Millybund was more committed than Blair himself to the concept of Cameroon's referendum, as Blair became the principles of the abandoned EU constitution, which was preserved by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued his winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who fell behind me in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to throw it on me - it looks like he's risking to repeat the Nil Kinnok's 80s boy Merdoko's strategy is a mistake and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy for interaction with the press - not with me, but perfectly with Andrew Marrom, whose vision in the VVS he was sitting in the resurrection.
The official position of the Corbin of Europe is that I call evolution a delicately.
He says he wants us to stay in the reformed EU.
In fact, most people outside the traditional Ukip trend and a wider range of "little England's sidewalks" among the stars can probably say "yes".
That's the same thing that Hillary-Benn, but not Bennet-Bennyt said on radio and TV this week, and his internal combat forces refused to acknowledge that the appointment of Corbin, a carrying John McDonnell, a "tenna" finance minister was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the '70s when his ex-father was on TV all his strengths because he did not go too far from his position in the Cabinet of Ministers.
The battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any circumstances” - Benna’s phrase - is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to the press and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general opinion.
In order to tell us the democracy and his "boy" Corbin, remember, he has even taught me - the discipline of the messages remains important in the cycle of seven days a week, especially in the waters of social networks, the expectations of panic and traffic.
It is reasonable not to allow Cameroon to leave Europe as easily as possible, allowing it to accept the proper support of the liberarians during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But MacDonnell's and Corbin's major mistake about membership in the EU - within the 'Bennit' economy of the restored economy - is no longer the issue of esoteric debate among the left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissist, the small-scale distinction, is a central principle in doctrinal disputes.
With regard to his allegations about Nato-Tom Watson, it is not surprising that J.K. will not act out - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why does Paris or Berlin have a political capital - they also have suspicious voters - at Britain's expense when it may be unreasonable?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Government of the Torr in power has set aside the costs that I have been reminded of on Monday at a forum called the British Influence Security.
Experts critically review public Health England electronic cigarettes
Statements by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes are less than 95 per cent valuable than smoking have been made at the meeting of 12 persons, some of whom are associated with tobacco industry as reported by the researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet identified the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their electronic cigarettes report.
PHE published an important report - "reversible burden" last month, calling it "the overall review of evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the authenticity of the data and pointed to the link between some experts and tobacco industry.
In an editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized the “extraordinary shock evidence” based on which PHE had established its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers were asked whether these statements were "recorded or oral".
Martin McKi, a teacher of European Health Organization in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: "The basic principle of health should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public is expected that the PHE statements that “the best estimate is that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less valuable than tobacco” are based on a detailed collection of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is the only meeting of 12 people who have gathered to develop a multi-ethnic analysis model of decision-making to sum up their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are presented in scientific publication.
McKi and Kepwell reported that one of the sponsors of the congregation was a company called EuroSwiss Health, the Director-General who had been informed that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the field of health in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced funding from the electronic cigarettes manufacturer, not forgetting the funding he had received from Philip Morris, who had previously been reported to have received from the tobacco company.
There was no reasonable explanation for the election of members of the Council, but a number of known electronic cigarettes parties were included, some of whom also claimed to be financed by the industry in publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tax office at PHE.
The scientific article published by the group “excellently agreed” that there is a lack of “high evidence of the impact of most of the products on criteria”, wrote McCee and Capell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McKi and Capell said that the PHE statements that “there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or smoking offenders” are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and well-being at PHE, said that the BMJ had already responded.
He said, "electronic cigarettes are much less valuable than tobacco."
One of the two who smoked all their lives died of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the far-reaching consequences.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what is evidence and what does not prove, especially where there have been doubts about the relative danger compared with tobacco.
About 80,000 people die of smoking diseases each year, and smoking is about 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only part of the harm that smoking is causing. We are fulfilling our mission before the nations.
Former Head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop East Enders series.
Former Head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop publishing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would make a lot of money for a successful show like a nice operation on the Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensees should be used only to create programmes that are not issued by other British telecoms.
He argued with the BBC that the company had placed the transmission of public news, which was probably only a small part of the audience, at a time when competitors had a high rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General of BBC Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had failed to work with BBC during Channel 4.
"I cannot separate from the idea that BBC is preparing to launch and transmitting transfers that could show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the Committee on Communications of the Chamber of Lords in the light of the further ruling of the BBC.
If you keep the licence collection that I do not consider a good decision in the medium and long term, the company should leave only those programmes that are not issued and are not intended to be issued by other companies.
Shoo The Voice is going out to the efer in the spring, because the creators want to get as much support as possible in the future.
The idea that no one else would ever show it, is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; they are generally known for their own production.
Other channels, of course, would be far away for her.
I don't understand how it can be public news.
I don't think that's gonna hurt BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 channels from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of being indicted “because of the ambiguity of staff and because of their belief that this is the best way to obtain long-term support”.
His comments on BBC's most popular show are echoed by the comments of Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his lecture at MacTaggarta in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that BBC sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that lower public BBC transfers “keep going to BBC4, where it is often impossible to assess audition, but therefore the company’s function is carried out, and this may be presented as an argument in the Hungarian sermons justifying income from the licensed collections at 4 billion pounds: “No, of course, we do all these non-stop transfers that no one sees.”
They will be placed in a pit where no one will ever see them.
In connection with the licensing assembly, Johnson informed the Committee: "I call on you to find a more aggressive system with regard to who will get the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people whose 150 pounds are big money, I'm interested, they think so because they don't look very much and listen to BBC.
Former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke to the Committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission for "information, education and entertainment".
He noted that only a small part of the BBC released material is currently officially classified as educational - it is said that 1 per cent of the television content and 0.1 per cent of the radio - and that the company should support the initiative of Australian and Canadian news companies under "information, education and entertainment".
On the issue of partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in such areas as "Translated concerts" (only part of them, he said, are on TV) and to enter into alliances with commercial business companies to make them available for online testing.
Sonogenesis allows the brain to control cells using sound waves
The video shows how the movements change when they are influenced by sound impulses.
Scientists have developed reds with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
Crossword puzzles change the direction of movement when they are influenced by sound impulses, too high that the human ear can hear them.
Impulsions are affected by the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on the theme: Students manage brain activity through the world
Scientists have said that the reds show the possibility of a new method called "sonogenetics", which is used to stimulate certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is available outside the body.
Schrikant Chalasani, a scientist at the institute of Solca, La Hoyoa, California, told Guardian that this method could once again replace the profound stimulation of the brain - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Reds usually do not respond to ultrasounds, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in liquids containing microscopic powders.
He discovered that the lungs are strengthening ultrasound waves that then penetrate into the red body.
The reinforced ultraviolet waves affect the structure called the ion channels TRP-4, found in the membranes of some red cells.
The ultrasound waves enable these ion channels to open and stimulate the cells associated with them are reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create neutrons that can be managed by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetically modified reds, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound for the effects of modified organs, sound waves were strengthened by microscopic pulses and introduced into the red bodies by enabling modified motor neurons.
This approach is similar to that used in optogenetics, a new approach that enables scientists to include and exclude neurons with the help of global impulses.
It is claimed that compared with this method, sonogenesis can have some benefits.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the required area of the brain by the eyepiece, the low frequency ultrasound waves pass safely through the body’s clothing, so that their delivery does not need to be carried inside the pellets.
"We believe that, in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will at the time make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal," Chalasani said.
He added that the methodology could also be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
The forbidden torture equipment is right on your knees!
Advertising is published on the British arms trade
Consider Amnesty International's role in protesting arms exhibitions.
Stimulating drones!
Blowing ears of iron canals!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-smooth drums that cause unexplained pain, but do not leave traces!
There is no doubt that this declaration of the largest international arms exhibition is a parade prepared by Amnesty International with a view to drawing attention to the intention of the British Government to “disarm” the repressive regime, using the exhibition of armed technologies and security systems at the ExCeL Centre in Dockwolds.
Subject: Disarmation of DSEI: The authoritarian regimes go to London
However, the special campaign also resulted in the sudden appearance of many buses on bus stops and on metro journeys that need to be seen again.
"A great announcement, dating from 15 to 18 September?" - written on one of them by the fonts of the London metro with the image of the DLR line turning into a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers are burning on the DLR line. Passengers are asking for help to mix the weapons.
300 posters were painted by artists who performed their work at the Museum of Bad Design in the Banks of Dismalland Park.
A collection called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London, using a 6-pound set of cable keys, which is said to be “appropriately accessible to the third commercial space on the bus stop of the planet”.
London transporters are not happy with such "vandalism" as unauthorized posters.
One of the parallel announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gwen Grindon, Curel Designs and Professor at Essex University, artists are becoming more demanding and seek to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start to work with protesters, realizing that they have to go to the real world because of their experience if they want to influence society.
Another protest against the deployment of weapons that welcome passengers in the subway.
Amnesty's video was screened more than 100,000 times over 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a VCCP agency working for bono, attracting a graphic designer and sound artist, also working free of charge.
The creative director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was exposed to the advertising silence of the arms exhibition, passing through the ExCel calendar, and he thought, "Let them set up a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and hypnotistic corporate advertising, but “to fill her house with bright colors and animation has become a more exciting occupation”.
"They have undoubtedly helped us to pay attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibition," says Tom Davis from Amnesty.
We now need the Government of Great Britain to take action and to ensure that this torture equipment will not be sold directly in our way.
It is possible that the most creative experience on the issue of arms is within ExCeL, where the participants are trading fantastic UFH.

Eight Golden Rules of Living in Student Communities
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student society as a normal 19-year-old person, still believing in burden and moral relativism, but I'm just now reminding myself of the boundless pleasures of those I've scattered -- and many long-distance complaints to others.
Basically, what I learned can be explained by eight simple rules.
The transition to society can vary from the drop in nerve to the absolutely frightening one.
It's encouraging to tell people where you took the academic vacation and where you took it, why you support Corbin and why you're "just, I don't like, I hate Marmite," because, seriously, the kid, it's just a HAHAHA, I'll have it."
Breathe.
And help others to overcome them is also asking questions and showing interest.
This will support your conversation and help you to find people who like you, not those whom you would not even talk to, even if they were angry with you, and who would spread the fire.
Give people space.
People’s homes are often turned into drinking facilities, pools, and places of general shopping, but they are also the place where people dress and dress and wear lower clothes.
More on the subject: Don't even think about starting school at the university, in relation to
Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your room should be a refugee, but many communities form a chat culture from one room to the other, which contributes to friendship, society and lasting friendships.
It can be someone who tries to regain power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to go, and I have been able to restore the energy I spent with you."
Try to feel when the customer is upset with the audience, not to get in touch with him, but to send a text message.
Come on, come on, come on, do it.
One young man in my community followed this principle: If the door was not closed, he was invited to go.
He saw something.
Get your friends out of the way.
Since you're starting a university life on the peaks of the popularity of the Baker-Off show, you're going to go to the door to introduce and introduce a piece of chocolate pie - not so strange as to remember in the 1950s with them, "We're neighbors, I've got something for you, and now you're tired, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering home rest is an excellent way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to heal you, and as a result, your face will likely be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on how good you are.
Badly dark stones of milk, sugar, and beer will soon stop people from getting sleepy when you're in touch with them.
Eating is a typical crime in student communities.
Of course, the use of some chicken is red, but if it's a cow, take some milk for what?
Get to the owner of the milk.
It's almost all he's suggesting you don't get tired, even if it's in the kitchen.
If someone steals your stuff, it's disgusting, and I'm sorry, but try to be more mature than my neighbor, who's put in his little ice cream so he can get away with someone who's got him without a question.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noise that's gonna make people sleep or learn.
Not only to be a nice person, but also because you're the same people who talk about stolen houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to have a barban and bas-gitter sound, as it was 3 hours in the morning, and she had an exam tomorrow morning.
The neighbor's response increased the volume.
When he finally shut the door on Friday morning, she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours and then broke up his music and shut the door behind him, headed for a three - hour examination.
Isn't it romantic if your future husband lives in the same society as you?
On the other hand, it wouldn't be extraordinary, before the locker is removed, even if you took a neighbor for your future wife, broke in with them, had relations, and should have seen him every day, and maybe watch how he goes on his side with all your common friends?
Of course, you won't tell the heart, but if the burning neighbor is not exactly your future husband, try to cool your own dishes.
At the moment you realize that someone left the keys inside his own closed room, the border between the play and the drama is more than it seems.
A good idea is fun, but it turns into a contradiction for the seconds considered.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson about safety, turning away from anything - but never pack a room of toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the outside door and drop the keys in the glass with the water that you then put into the morosilica, but don't attract the foreign stuff through the Blu-Tack glass more than twice.
iOS 9: how to set up a new operating system on iPhone after the Apple upgrade
A new operating system may be requested to select the General and then the Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you jump it and set it up.
Some have encountered problems after the installation when an error report has been made telling them that “renewing the annex has failed”.
To avoid this, users are advised to wait or wait until life is calm or to try to recover via iTunes.
Your phone records will allow you to pass the whole process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free space, but Apple has reduced the likelihood of this action, reduced the size of the update, and simplified the implementation with the assistance of a special silence, which suggests removing the applications and re-establishing them after the process has been completed.
I'm convinced that when you update your phone, there's a number of devices that don't allow the battery to be turned off.
If the amount is too low, Apple will continue to update, as the order of the phone in the process may lead to an update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
US Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Assad leads only to the expansion of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to the Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
The US Secretary-General John Kerry called the Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secret Kerry made it clear that the continued support of the President of Asada from Russia creates a risk of tension and the spread of conflict, as well as a negative impact on our overall goal - combating extremism - - if we also do not continue to concentrate on seeking ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of the authorities," the representatives of the United States Department said.
They also noted that Kerry had repeatedly stressed the commitment of the United States to fight against the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be a member of her.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in attempting to oppose the Islamic State”.
The representatives of the White House said on the fifth floor that they did not know exactly what action the Russian army had taken in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
In addition, White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the President decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will wake up and try to make this call."
Barak Obama himself considered Russia ' s decision to increase support for the Assad regime ' s "survival rate".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that the continued support of Asada would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings - and the situation got worse," said the president of the United States.
Imports are free from customs duties.
Mineconomic development is intended to temporarily release iron imports and other floating means for breathing and sports from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes in the list of goods for temporary free of charge were prepared by the Ministry of Order of the RF Government.
In this regard, the Information was reported by the Assistant Minister for Economic Development Elena Laschkina.
In June 2015, Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of departments -- Minéconomics, Mintranso RF, Mincultura, MID, MIC, FSB, FTS, Rosturism, to prepare proposals for the establishment of favourable conditions for hunting in coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the lack of infrastructure for the conservation, maintenance and maintenance of the ice.
Owners prefer to keep their courts outside the border - about €200 million per year are punished by European States for the maintenance, repair and service of the yacht.
Russia has prepared a draft decision by the Council of the European Economic Commission on the making of changes to the List of Goods temporarily imported with full exemption from customs duties and taxes, which provides for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on import duties and other travel facilities for air and sports.
In the view of the Ministry, this will undoubtedly contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for the development of ahing in coastal areas of the country, Laskina noted.
The question was addressed to the Subcommission on Customs Tariff, Non-tariff Regulation, Protection Measures in the External Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and was also approved by the Governments after the discussions.
As noted by the representative of the Minécono-Development, the proposed measure on full-time release on importation is, in fact, beneficial.
Therefore, following the adoption of the protocol to the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Minécono-Development Council proposed to the Eurasia Economic Commission for Discussion with the EEA States, Laskina explained.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from customs duties includes goods necessary for the promotion of external economic activities and international cooperation, for the use of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, for international assistance and for the provision of equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control equipment, maintenance equipment, design and decorations, transportation, laboratory and master, driving, vehicle, motor vehicles, sports equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment and equipment.
In the press service of the Mintrans RF News, it was reported that mandatory provisions had been drawn up on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Fedosia and Euppatori, which provided for a simplified procedure for the formation and exit of small, sportal and explosive vessels in the port of the sea.
The Ministry of the Interior has instructed the Captains of the Crimea to ensure that the simplified procedure is applied for the entry into the port of the sea and the exit of the listed vessels from the port of the sea.
Mintrans has also prepared projects by the Government of the RF Government on the approval of the coast of the port of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Fedos, orders have already been adopted, the remaining members of the Conciliation Committee have noted in the press office.
In the view of the Mintrans, the governor, the classification and the disclosure of the registration of the ships used for non-commercial purposes, should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult to deal with the Hytting because of the weak infrastructure.
Looking south of Italy and France, it is the entire constantly developing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, it's actually all right.
Our beach is a small, unique piece of land that can be operated around the clock, it's the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendžica, Novorossia, Anap.
However, it is a major challenge to establish a very strict border service rule in this area: the scope of the permit should be set out in order to be able to escape.
In Russia, you were even going somewhere else.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then the problem is where to take it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Dennis Novikov.
With regard to the location of the port, there are now special ports in Moscow and St. Petersburg for the port up to 30 hours. The ports are also sent to the port in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Newspapers noted that the buyers were rich, but with the beginning of the crisis, the demand for them declined.
The World Bank gave Ukraine $500 million credit.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
The press service of the international organization was notified.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the Communication said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimijo Fan said that banking sector reforms would help restore real economy loans and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had observed the first signs of stabilization.
However, because of the seriousness of the problem, Fang calls on the Government of Ukraine to speed up the reform.
Earlier, the Government of Poland had approved the grant of €100 million in Ukraine, transmitting the RIA News.
Prisons are requested to create individual blocks for transmitters.
The Public Council, at the Federal Criminal Service (FSIN), on the protection of the rights of judges in October 2015, will discuss the possibility of creating separate block columns for transgenders and transmissions.
The news was told by a member of the Council of Vladislav Gribb.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicted persons in Russia who have not been convicted of sex, individual cameras, blocks or even (if they are many) may be provided in private prisons in the prospect of establishing a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Gribb stresses that to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places may only be determined only after they are convicted of appropriate medical experiences that will prove that the offender is a person who is actually identified as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Gribb is convinced that the isolation of transiters from other prisoners will ensure the security of the punishment.
According to him, the proposed practice is effective abroad: separate cameras are provided in the SIZO (where the accused are before the court's decision) and special blocks are in the correctional institutions.
Today it is the only way out of working with such criminals.
They need to be isolated, such as the presence of transits and transmitters in conventional cameras, that is a problem for their families and the sea.
The downgrading of the transmissions by the camera is guaranteed, says Vladislav Gribb.
Depending on the size of the large city, the number of offenders with an indefinite field, it is necessary to calculate where to distribute them.
SIZO is not exactly required - only cameras, prisons blocks.
Yes, a separate column is possible if there's a lot of transmitters.
As the Grib explained, 50 or 100 people could be held in the block, and if a special corporation was established in Russia alone, prisoners of sexual harassment could be punished there from any region.
Citizens are present in the SIZO at the crime scene, so the arrival of transfers or transmitters from other entities during the investigation and the trial process is unrealistic, and this is where this practice is applied to those who have already been convicted in a given colony - yes - is considered to be Grib.
Remember, the pressure of law enforcement officers was unable to determine in which case a male or female investigator was detained for the custody of 24-year-old drug addict Dmitria Kojukova (known as Alina Davis), for which a man with a girl had not been arrested outside.
He was released from the house under the visa.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and media, as the mechanism for the content of transmitters in SISO and the colonies in Russia has not yet been fully discussed.
The Russian human rights defender, the LGBT movement activist (LGBT-Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nicolai Alexev supported the idea of creating special places to punish transgenders, notes that it is also possible to define people in the colony, whether male or female, depending on their own wishes.
In view of the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is right.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of security for homosexuals in prisons, says Alexev.
Prisons should be safe, so certain blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, more than they are in prisons than transgenders.
At the same time, Alexev is skeptical that there are many citizens in Russia who are willing to give themselves to transsexuals in order to escape in a different manner from the usual colonies.
Of course, medical evidence can be provided before people can be placed in a colony for transmitters, but not always unique.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change his mind, Alexev said.
A person may feel comfortable.
But as long as there are no separate places to be punished for transmitters, I doubt that prison officers will think seriously about the safety of such people and put them in the dark of their orientation or sexual identity.
At the same time, the International Expert on Reproductive Health in the Territory of RF Boris Lordkippanide noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of trans-sexuals into the colony could severely slow down the beginning of the sentence of the sentence.
The Commission is created - this is the question of sexology, the psychiatry conducts long observation, not one test on which a high-end conclusion is made.
Today's psychiatry can do that.
Therefore, prior to the change of sex, potential patients always undergo such experiments - they show exactly whether the exchange of sex with the surgical intervention is the necessary measure, says Lordkipanide.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how this system could be implemented with regard to the accused, since the average of such a survey lasted a month.
Doctors, despite the overall idea of the establishment of individual transsexual blocks, also doubt that, under current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate that there is no official statistics, but if it is taken into account that about 5 per cent of Russian homosexuals, it can be said that the transmitters are even less than those who have such a denial and still commit crimes, at least a small number, said Lordkipanide.
Now, at the request of the colony of homosexuals, transmitters can obtain certain conditions of content.
Michael Anthipov won a youth's peace campaign on chess.
In Hunti-Mansieska, the campaign for peace has been completed for 20 years among young people.
The end of the premise was more than an intelligible one.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and he became a Russian, Michael Antipov, who was still unable to capture the Polish Jana-Kshitoff Dudu, who would probably go to the title.
In the girl’s victory, the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux was celebrating.
The Peace Championship, which has been held since September in Hunti Mansieska, has already been in the middle of the tournament, has been said to have lost almost everything since the representative of Poland Jan-Kshitoff Duda, who has issued a series of four victories (sornings carried out under the Swiss system in 13 towers), has certainly captured leadership.
In view of the fact that Duda was a retiring-favorite, even though it was considered one of the most promising young shashmatists, the likelihood that he would leave a good shot was very low.
And even when Duda saved the revolution and allowed the Russians to cut down Michael Antipuu to 0.5 ball, he remained a obvious favourite in the fight against the title.
In order to win the leader, it was necessary to win the 13th tour.
But even if that doesn't help, you win Duda's party.
In addition, this obligation of victory could, of course, be attributed to the game of a Russian chess player and lead to uncompromising mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He was sure to meet Frank Rambaldi, and then he was forced to wait for his party to be completed when he met with Benjamin Bok.
Luckily, for Anthip's Polish chessman, he was against the Dutchman last night.
Anthipov and Duda thus collected the same number of shots as 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had better additional indicators.
As a result, the leadership of the Hunti-Mansie Autonomic Area, the governor of Natalya Komarova, has traditionally given great attention to the development of the chess in the region.
And there was no such thing as an intruder.
The tournament leader, Natalia Boxe (Ukraine), was not enough to lose the title in the last trip, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russians, Alina Bivol, did not allow her to conquer Buxus.
The Russian sports team remained second with a stop from the champion in 0.5 ball.
The environment is changing regional structure.
The Company unites the Privatian and Ural regions in one of the largest regions of the Volzski-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - in the region of the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Mr. Michael Slobodin noted, the changes are being made to "stop playing the market" to develop a company "in new, not always favourable external conditions".
In the interview, Mr. Slobodin explained that he intended to reduce the "ten per cent" of staff in Russia.
The representative checked 78 Moscow's tasteful Burger King and issued 367 regulations.
As a result, the restaurant at the Vololomsk six was exhausted by 50 thousand rubs, and the construction on the Big Tull Street was closed at 90 hours, but it resumed its work after all violations had been resolved.

Igor Artemev, head of the FAS, stated that the anti-indication agency was 10 per cent of the tariffs on goods and supplies, as requested by the OAS.
At first they wanted 17% indexes, now they want 10%, and also billions of budget subsidies, he says.
We're saying it's not right, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, reject expensive personnel, football teams, own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that the FAS had its “more stringent” proposals now being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is looking at the possible non-recording option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of performing a full-scale payment option of $300 million, the gold-producing company reported.
In this case, Polymetal is to be paid to Sumeru up to $80 million (a difference between the price of the shares for Sumeru and market charges) which may be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to implement options or to require payment.
Details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was closed as part of the purchase of Polymetal of the project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.

Minipromtor: The address food aid will not be a model card in the SSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtuhov, reported that the local food aid programme would not be an analogue to the food distribution system existing in the CSD.
This is about the timely local food aid to the population and support of an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card".
It would be particularly important to note that the proposed product maps do not have to be passed over the long-term total deficit, the card distribution system, with the number of products obtained.
As long as we have proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," said Mr. Evtukhov, Mr. TASS.
“E” previously wrote that the food card introduction programme for the poor has been introduced to the Government.

In the current year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers of Top-1000 Russian Managers is conducted 16 times.
As a tool to assess the professional representation of Russian senior managers, the study has led to the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in sectors and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of ularets of the ratings last year.
The winners of the past year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year's rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list of candidates is proposed to allocate up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the total number of candidates.
The following executives may be assigned to the company: the Director of Finance, the Business Director, the Marketing Director, the Director of Staff, the IT Director, the Director of Public and Corporate Relations, the Director of Relations with the Authority, the Director of Corporate Management.
Each proposed expert is invited by the manager to participate in the rating and is allowed to appoint its management team and up to ten new directors from other companies.
The promotion of industrial applications is based on the sectoral classification of the Managers Association: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry industry, machinery, mediobism, metallurgy, multi-professional wooding, professional services, communications, services and the production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a password and password for access to www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can leave their evaluations on the proposed criteria for each operational direction.
The "Best Choices" principle is based on the rating methodology: the top managers evaluate the top managers, the functional managers evaluate the functional managers.
Such a principle would allow for the maximum authentic assessment of the professional representation of the college.
The final results of the exercise are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
The expert commissions are invited to the clear meetings of all candidates for the current year and multiple candidates for the retiring of previous years.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission on the Adoption of the List of High Leaders and the Eight Committees on the Adoption of Official Directions.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the sites remain strictly on-line assessment and are closed to the publication of the rating) or to submit updates to them in accordance with the list of candidates for reserve.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of "E".
At the time of publication, changes can be made to the status of managers and companies.
The rate for investment is 10-13 per cent.
According to experts, the credit market for small and medium-sized enterprises in January-April last year amounted to 40 per cent.
What, according to your assessment, is the situation today?
Following the panic settings of the end of 2014-2015, the amount of the MFI's credit declined significantly.
The reason is understandable: a sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from the 25-30 per cent credit.
If the bank had been able to increase all its potential problems in the future, from time to time, it would not be possible to do so now: rates and so on.
For business, the current rate of MFI credits is disproportionate.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their coverage.
The 10-13 per cent rate would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive income.
How many of your estimates do you think are satisfying with the question of creditors?
After a decrease in the percentage rate of CB, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observation, customers have been approached with a lot of credit.
Firstly, businesses do not understand the prospects for their development and future incomes.
Today, the business has one output: it must be learned to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and region.
It is necessary to monitor more closely the current results, control the movement of funds.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modernise equipment, reduce production costs and energy security.
All of this, in the end, allows companies to produce more competitively and keep business even in a unstable economic situation.
What key trends will be strengthened and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the percentage change?
The average rate reduction forecast will depend much on the Central Bank's policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in the reduction of the key rate.
However, the radical decline in credit prices for SMEs is not worth it.
In the current situation, firstly, inflation is an increase in the demand for real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia remains high even when the rate of CB is reduced.
In terms of the length of time, the traditional small and medium-sized enterprises limited in both the ability to fill funds and the options for economic behaviour adjustment will inevitably pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That is what Mazda says by Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, romantic and at the same time difficult enough for those who are accustomed to cartilage or latrines.
And the new crossword CX-5, as well as any other model of the brand: without the charms of attractive, technically perfect inside.
Japan has already been able, by its Japanese, to be responsible for the products of the Eastern Party to the state of the full east.
How convenient it may be to bring arguments into use by cars from other countries, and the person even agrees in principle with these arguments, but the whole discussion is based on the final phrase: "But this is the Japanese car!
And don't argue about anything!
Such people must probably love not only technology but also more Japanese.
Citizening from the Bashe route, feeding a fasaby, collecting cats and wearing your mate - not in the kimono, of course, but on the corners of the street of Japanese fashion: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
Please, the Japanese school form is the only form that girls are satisfied with and after school.
It has wonderful qualities, both at the same time and in the same way, sensitive and firm.
And as the girl is older, the girl's got a big step.
The main change outside CX-5 is the radar line with five horizontal lines.
However, where the vehicle is more powerfully transformed into a new front and rear frame, the vehicle is currently known as a vehicle.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very compatible.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensitive, but the outside has a sense of urgency.
There is no need to call the police.
According to the role CX-5, one of the most secure in the world, only hundreds of Japanese peace can be tested.
The diesel engine, with a volume of 2.2 litres, provides a high temperature in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel of this engine is constructed with a total power of 175 C. - 5.9 C.E. - a strong aggregate of exclusively automatic transmission and full input.
Black bottles, black bags, black bags...
To add a little black hole to this image, you can select the legend with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
In addition, in Mazda, the maximum effort has been made to prevent you from being in your own DTP in the role CX-5.
In order to further enhance the comfort, while maintaining the excellent management, it has redesigned the construction of front and rear amortizers, and optimised the form of the plugging of the front lower wheels.
The full supply system was adapted under Russian conditions.
The level of noise from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
A buyer in a flower or dress is as expensive as a budget seat.
Another case if a girl grows up in a bathroom with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a role fighter's genre.
Her attention will then be given to nothing less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved construction of both the front and the rear seats, which provides optimal space storage and for large spaces, and for long legs, who has what it has.
Another long-term assurance is that the front of the central tunnel is now soft and is not on board.
The largest set of active safety systems in Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
To identify potential threats, radar, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is also an adaptive lighting, and a warning of pollution from the fields, monitoring of dead zones, and safe heating.
The Mazda CX-5 is one of the best bakers in the class.
A convenient minimum of words is placed in the goods of 561. The last seats are in proportion to 4:2:4. Each section is provided with a separate payroll and is increased to 1560.
A hero's costume in Japan is called "kigurums."
It's particularly interesting to see the chigurus-pijams.
She's got everything!
Of course he's asleep.
But it's still a pleasure to have small children.
Or just throw it out on the street...
That's so great when it's possible to choose a dress, a manner of behavior or a car.
Thank you for helping in the preparation of the Kawaicat store.
Kiev has destroyed the atom union.
Kiev officially declared Ukraine ' s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the accession of the ACE Hmelnik.
The High Council, in the middle of its second attempt, nevertheless voted in favour of breaking the agreement with Moscow.
The third and fourth block agreements were signed in 2010-2012, but the project was not yet implemented.
In the middle of the Supreme Council, Ukraine adopted a law extending the 2010-2012 agreement with the FF on the construction of a third and fourth block at the ACE Hall.
The draft law was passed only by the Government in the second vote, the first time it was held by 210 MPs at a minimum of 226, but then the 234 members of Parliament were voting on the draft.
In the case of CSD, the Hmelnique ECE for a specific project should have been accounted for by four energy blocks of 1 GHG with reactors of type BWER, but only two were able to be built.
The negotiations with Moscow on the move led to the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Agreement by 2010 and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since there were no funds in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that the construction of blocks belonged to the Russian side's credit, but the funds had not been allocated.
Following the conversion to Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relation to the two countries, Kiev began to create relations with Moscow in the atomic industry, declaring that it would refuse to cooperate on the ACE Hmelnet and on the construction project in Ukraine of the nuclear fuel pipeline.
The only area in which relations have been maintained remains the fuel in the RFF for the active Ukrainian AECs (encouraged about half of the electricity generation in the country), as long as Ukrainian NECE "Energoat" replaces Russian supplies with something.
From plans of the Hmelnik-AEC to another contractor in Ukraine, the negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were still being held in Kiev in 2014.
UN gender against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ghi Mun, during the press conference, reported that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"No military decision," the AP replied to the question of Syria ' s military support from Russia.
Mr. Ghi Mun also reported that he would hold a meeting with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of the IMD of the United Nations Permanent Members of the United Nations later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Vice-President of the Russian Federation, Nicolai Boldanovski, told Russia that Gentshab did not exclude the possibility of establishing a future VVS base in Syria.
Until there's no such plan.
"But everything can be," said Mr. Godanowski.
"E" had previously reported that the United States did not trust the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the banning of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
For more details of the United States ' s doubts about Russia ' s assistance, read in the material "E" "The Russian military presence in Syria is worried about Washington".
The PAOBSE reports on possible meetings of the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of the OSCE, Arthur Gerasimov, reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with the Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the south-eastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarian delegations," Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Mining Agreement and “to return to the normal viability of our countries”.
On whether the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level is currently possible, or as a contact group on the PA OBSER platform, Mr. Geresimov noted that dialogue is being held, there are mini-agreements.
At the same time, according to politics, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
The former representative of Ukraine, ex-President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-declared Donetskaya and the Republic of Luganese had not substantially changed their position on the three-party negotiations, but the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties gave orders.
Yesterday, the Lower New York Electoral Commission produced the results of the elections in the city-based municipal area by distributing 12 parliamentary mandates on the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the election were raised by representatives of the CPRF accused of the “falseization” election.
The comments of the opposition were not adopted.
Together, he rejected the Russian Communist Party in the organization of a referendum on the cancellation of the blockade of multi-smoker houses.
The municipal election officially presented the results of the elections in the village of the Netherlands of the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1,03 million people were included in the list of voters in the Netherlands, 746.7 thousand were voted in the local commissions, and 268 thousand were elected.
More than 11.7 thousand booklets were identified as inactive and 24 were lost.
12 mandates were allocated to political parties yesterday, depending on the votes they had received.
The list of six seats in the pride is based on Dmitri Svatkov, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasil Šupranov, Elizabeth Solončenko, Veceslava Rosterieev and Igorno Nagorno.
The only mandate of the LDR was received by the leader of the Vladimir Jirinovski Party.
The two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulan and Mr. Alexander Tarnaev.
Three "Justice" mandates are available to Alexander of the Soviet Union, Igora of Goddanov and Mikhail Shaluginu.
Now, within five days, these candidates must be determined whether they will work as MPs in the city: if they refuse the mandate, they will proceed to the next candidate on the list.
The President of the Gorisbirkom, Alexander Maceev, informed the members of the Commission that he had made threats to "the transmission of the telegram to Jirinov and others" on the subject of a rejection of the mandates.
In adopting the Protocol on the outcome of the elections, the representatives of the CPRF expressed numerous violations.
A member of the Gorzbirkom, with the right to a hearing by the CPRF, Leonid Krassankutski, proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in the four districts No.21-24, recalling that, under the direction of the Head of the Administration of the Sormov area, the entry into the building of the administration of the four district commissions was closed.
Within a long time, no Members of the House of Spirit, no candidates, no observers, and a reasonable scan with the noise of the radio department were shown on the television.
At the meetings of the Committees, all observers and members of the Commission, with the right to vote, had the opportunity to attend.
Their head stopped access only when the vote was finalized and the local commissions had not yet arrived to deliver their bulletins.
This was done to prevent various prosecutions.
"The head was repaired, and the interested parties could attend all the meetings," said a member of the summit of Natalia Androusina.
The communists argued that more than four hours of illegal detention in a blockade of the administration ' s building had been unlawfully detained by the Conciliation Council of the People's Aristobian, with regard to which a statement had been made to the Committee.
The opposition also argued that a number of UIKs on the election day began to print the urns at 6 to 7 o'clock in the morning, with a ballot in which to vote quickly.
The members of the commissions with the right to vote and the observers had not been informed, so they had already arrived at the beginning of the elections on 8 March.
The communiqué is convinced that in the morning prior to the opening of the polling stations, the ballots could be uncontrollable.
However, there was no violations of unexplored ballots, according to Alexander Maceeva, of more than 124 complaints that had already been dealt with in various ways.
The members of the Commission and their colleague, Maria Poopowo, did not support the proposal of the Commission and her colleague, "Justice of Russia", to proceed with amendments to regional legislation, in order to clearly establish the time for the opening of the scrolls of the early vote that will then fall into the urn.
"In the course of your own initiative, contact the CIC," said Mrs. Pope Alexander Maceev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CPRF, Sergei Samahoin, complained that the election had ignored ten complaints and covered the vote.
"You're not here on a myth, you're more careful than you are!" - the president of the election.
The Protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the election should adopt the general results of the elections, after which the first city meeting of the Sixth Assembly will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the City Electoral Commission rejected the political party ' s Communists of Russia ' s registration of an initiative group to conduct a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were gathered to discuss two issues: whether they agreed that multi-smokers should be "removed immediately", and the housing and municipal services tariffs "smoothing up to 2020".
However, Irina Masola's lawyer explained that the treatment of the Russian Communists was contrary to legislation.
The FedEx drawing is a mixed character, a decrease in the forecast for 2016.
FedEx was reported to have had adverse results in the last quarter, and the delivery service had reduced the forecast of annual income due to demand for goods and increased costs in its local transport unit.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers to the festival.
Its shares amounted to about 2.5 per cent of pre-markets within 45 minutes of the opening of the bridge in the middle.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is planning to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ends in the next May, less than 20 cents in the previous forecast.
The analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The decrease in forecast is observed despite an average rate of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase in the land transport of heavy goods or goods starting in November.
The company stated that it continued to plan for an increase in revenue compared to last year due to the decrease in costs, capital gain and the increase in online trade.
The president and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “worked stablely, taking into account the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The plan to hire workers at the festival was announced on the following day after the contestant's statement, UPS, that they planned to hire additional 95,000 staff, perhaps as much as they had taken over last year.
For the quarter ended 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income amounted to $2.42, which was estimated at $2.44, at the share of the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
The income increased by 5 per cent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years since the fall in the emergency international transport sector, resulting in a lack of gross income in its unit of experiential surpluses.
However, purchases on the Internet have greatly improved results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport emissions increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained overall without changes due to higher costs of major management and self-sustainment.
The Explosives Unit received a higher income due to higher basic rates, while in the freight sector, income increased due to increased labour costs.
In the preliminary markets, for example, before the FedEx stock exchange was opened, it amounted to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent - to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the June 11 record.
At the most expected meeting of the Federal Reserve System leaders, two days this week will be held for 27 feet from the Honduran forest, deciding whether to raise the key percentage rate for the first time in almost 10 years.
At the same time, a large number of strengthened rooms for high-level meetings in two stages will be adorned with a warm picture of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, must put the country's economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a double order from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to maintain stable prices here.
However, since the Great Reaction, the Heads of the Federal System have recognized that there is also a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
This third order may be an unknown factor in a nearly advanced decision to declare in Thursday whether the economy of the United States is prepared to withdraw from an unprecedented incentive that has provided almost a zero-short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even if most of the data show reliable economic growth, recent shocks on the world financial markets can also hold the federal system ' s leadings on a voluntary basis by raising the base rate on the federal funds, even on the four per cent point.
"It is obvious that the labour and inflation market will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Peggs, chief economist of the Brooklyn company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise taxes, the increasing uncertainty around the world market would be sufficient to give them reason to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what they do in the Federal Reserve System, which causes financial market collapse itself.
About half of the recently released economists in Bloomberg predicted a rise in the percentage rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect that the Federal system will be halted, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the risk of fast-acting.
This could lead to a fall in the market of shares if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who take decisions do not break the promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dou-Johns index rose to 228.89, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
It was hoped that those defining the federal system's strategy would leave the rate this week - John Loanski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research, said.
"It would be surprising if the Federal system would raise rates at this time," he noted.
If the lead of the Federal Reserve System is so done, "they must go far away in adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands, so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in the rate could bring financial markets under way, as this would create uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
A month ago, the Federal system seemed to have declined to raise the rate of 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small step in the slowing down of financial conditions, which could confirm the magnitude of the recovery of the United States.
Yellen stated at the beginning of the summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite the complaint by the Liberals that there was a need for greater economic progress.
While new jobs were delayed in August, the growth of the labour market was stable in this year.
The unemployment rate has decreased to 5.1 per cent in the past month, which is the lowest rate for more than seven years, almost at the level that is considered to be full employment in the Federal system.
The increase in wages shows signs of rapid growth.
While inflation continues to be below the central bank of the annual indicator by 2 per cent, the Federal System's leadership has stated that, for a key reason, it has become a temporary effect on high oil prices.
The economy "may also deal with higher rates, and needs them, taking into account the reduction of the labour market," noted Ian Sheferdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world became third at the end of the last month, after China took its currency.
The Dou-John's average index for industrial companies' shares was 16 per cent on record high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown of the Chinese economy could slow the world's growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dou-Johns index is now about 10% below the highest interest rate.
For the guidance of the Federal Reserve System, the market reimbursement is further complicated by the simple calculation of the rate increase.
"In the absence of information on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have been closing up on this meeting," said Steven D. Oliner, an senior researcher, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve Officer.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a great uncertainty about the consequences of the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the latest events in China," Olinner said.
World economy is not primarily concerned with the Federal system and should not be taken into account in the adoption of these decisions.
However, the Federal Reserve System has, in fact, become a world financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been tremendous.
One suggestion from the then president of Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could "response" its financial expansion was that the global market had been disturbed.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined with each other, it would be expected that the Heads of the Federal Reserve System would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts in order to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process was “faster than science”, noted Zakarri Karabell, director of Investnet Inc, a company that is engaged in global state-management strategies.
Jeffry Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, observed this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System there were cases of excessive response to the movement of the financial market which seemed to be not related to economic principles”.
Lacker, a member of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, who insisted on increasing the rate, took decisions 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent at three meetings, "without limited identified impacts for growth in the United States," Lacker said.
In the fall of the Federal System leaders, these reductions were rejected.
The federal reserve system should focus on stability only during major crises, such as market failure in 2008,” said Adam C. Posen, former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee.
The last panic and almost didn't get close to this level, he said.
"Of course, you would not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of growing rates because the markets are experiencing stress," said Pozen, president of his World Economic Institute, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Systems Act has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and I do not think that it should go beyond what is happening until it is changed.
Do you need a great Thai market?

Mr. Sergei Naruchkin admits that the United States intends to destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that the refugees can flee to Europe.
As Interfax gives, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator during the annual session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a party to the Conspiracy theory, but the question is itself: Is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have been destabilizing the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" - he asked.
"The belief of someone who imagined and knew that the flow of refugees, these unfortunate and deprived people who were saved from death, would be settled in the beneficiary countries of the EU," he added.
Narakkin wondered: "Did many political leaders in Europe openly express the causes of this crisis, the wave of refugees now literally engulfing their countries?"
"No, old Europe, for a common exception, prefers to shut up," he observed.
In the view of Narishkin, NATO supports many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has taken a long and unprejudiced view of it, and looks at it as a military samurai from NATO standards, as well as moral ideas and basic principles and norms of international law," the speaker emphasized.
Government troops and their lawful military formations are opposed to the militias that are mostly Muslim.
The Islamic State terrorist group was later joined by the opposition of the Syrian Government in Russia.
The United States is supported by rebels who oppose Assad and IG.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called for an unappreciative West to Russia.
The West Bank's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact based on the fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bar Assad in the interview with RT, the First Channel, Russia 24, the ICT, Russia today, the TASS, the Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
Assad said, the West did not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to take one person and place another for the interests of Western countries rather than for his family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the rapid development of Western media with the beginning of Ukraine's transformation.
According to him, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from the other West into the enemy, the king, the dictator, who has caused the Russian opposition that has come to power in a non-democratic way, despite having been elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to unite forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the Permanent Statements of the West to leave Assad itself, he noted that the President would come to the authority with the consent of the people through the elections, and if so, at the request of the people, not by the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president remains, and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighbouring Iraq.
Regarding military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, economic and military matters.
He examined the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tegeran's giving us a military technique.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them when there is a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-angiological coalition, known as the United States," Assad said.
The number of displaced persons increased by 230 thousand, the number of refugees to 11.5 million.
Part of the territory occupied the terrorist group “Islamic State”, banned in Russia.

Lavov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Policy: Peace: Lenta.ru
The US Secretary-General, John Kerry, spoke on the phone with the Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Lavrov.
Reuters is informed by a reference to the representative of the Department of Justice of John Kirby.
It is noted that the theme of the session was a conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide additional details.
He said that the United States had tools for "the further isolation of Russia" if it would support Syria's President Bara Assad, he transferred RIA News.
As reported by the Russian IMD, Lavour again emphasized the need to create a single front for combating terrorist groups in the territory of the country.
There was also discussion on ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis that could reduce tension on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, there were some issues of a bilateral nature.
Former U.S. officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the strengthening of the support of Asada.
In Washington, Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.

Borodda called the U.S. newspaper Strelkov's curse.
The former president of the Government, Alexander Borodya, self-evident of the Dominican People ' s Republic, examined the information published in The Washington Post, U.S.A.
He said this in a telephone interview with Lents.ru.
The Washington Post note is so beautiful that everything is turned clean.
The former Minister for the Defence of DNA Igorya Strelkova, of course, did not contact anyone and he “went out” from the territory of the Republic of Donbass in a very sensitive setting, without the faith, without the three funds signed by various personnel," he noted.
According to Bordoya, the story of Starling was true in the interview with the American newspaper reporter.
"Yes, I said that Starling had to be removed from the territory of the People's Republic of the Donetsk," said the former head of the Government of the DNA.
Borodda stressed that he was unaware of why an American edition correspondent decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia “connected”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a cause, this is a surprising misunderstanding of the words, because I emphasized that the Arrows have gone by themselves," Borodda noted.
"It's the keys to me and to Starling," he concluded.
Earlier on The Washington Post, an article quoted by Boroja as saying that he had brought the Arrow to Russia in a forced manner.
According to the report, Borodda noted that he had to contact his partner.
The Polish authorities started searching for a trip with the gold Nazis.
The Polish foresters started to scrape trees on the ground tunnel, where, on some data, a trip with the gold of the Third Reich was made.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, forest cleaning is necessary in order to verify the reliability of rail hearings with tanks.
Inland travel may include arms and valuable minerals.
On 31 August, the Governor of Poland, Thomas Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz), proposed that the new evidence of the existence of a gold trip was no longer credible.
However, the authorities decided to cover the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Jukhovski, stated that local laymen with a “99 per cent probability” had found the same trip with the gold of the Third Reich, mentioned in the legends.
Juhwski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the values were found, they would be owned by the State, while Russia would not be transferred.
In mid-August, two clients of the legal firm turned to the authorities of the Polish city of Walbji with a message that they had found a trip to the frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The chief druglogist of the RF proposed that tobacco be sold to people up to 21 years of age.
Russia's chief druglogist proposed that tobacco be prohibited until 21 years of age.
Eugenia Brown noted that before that age, “any psychoactive substance — tobacco, alcohol, drugs — is particularly harmful”.
He thus said in the direct ephere of the Gworit Moscow radio station, commenting on the fact that Svfed Valentina Matwienko had supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to 21-year-old citizens.
Man's creating an imbalance.
You can serve in the army for 18 years, a man is physically willing to do this.
He has been mentally prepared for a full life in society since the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally created by only 21 years," Brown noted.
Former member of the Public House and project leader Sultan Hamzaev informed the "News" that Matwienko supported the initiative to increase the value of the sale of alcohol and "recorded with the General Assembly to raise this issue again at the top of the House's Chamber".
According to an activist, the Federal Council will soon establish a working group to develop a bill under the leadership of Matwienko.
The Bible has been requested to verify the conformity of the Child Information Protection Act
Mr. Novosibirska invited the regional prosecutor to check the Bible in accordance with the federal law on the protection of children from information that affects their health and development, with a statement made on 16 September by the Correspondent Sib.Fm.
The author of the application stated that on 26 August 2015, he had obtained a copy of the Bible from the Russian Bible society in the Red Cross.
In the text of the book, he discovered fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ "Protection of Children from Information that affected their health and development".
On 16 September, a statement was adopted to consider the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the treatment of the inhabitants of Novosibirska will take place within 30 days.
It's not far enough to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the folly of the law itself, the complainant commented by Correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is a fundamental issue that will divide society.
It will begin to read the Bible as never before.
The Brazilian Federation of Pediatrics, Rio Grande, promotes healthy food for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization of the SPRS has developed a scandal that helps women to be convinced of the need for adequate food during breast-feeding: the method implies a demonstration of the images of young pregnant women described in the images of valuable food.
The milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and hydrocarbons from which children receive all the nutrients they need in order to produce a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs of pregnant and breast-feeding women, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie rate by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent studies have shown that one increase in calorificity is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor of health at Beylor Medical College in Texas revealed that the health of pregnant women has an impact on the expression of gender in children and prevents their development.
Unfortunately, the adverse effects of malnutrition on the child ' s immune system have been identified.
On the way to Hamburg, he got a school bus.
Near Hamburg, the trip took place in a school bus that stopped on the train.
The 23-year-old driver, aware that he could not move from the trailer, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a hearing on their eyes.
On the video, one of the students stopped him.
The panic was caused by an emergency among the students.
Some children began to cry and run to the roof.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger who had suffered a slight injury.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
The doctors are calling for a ban on the box.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) led to the ban on boxing in the country after the death of local sportsman David Browna-young.
On Monday, 28th, Brown died of injuries found in one of the Philippinesans, Carlo Magali.
One of the regional titles of the International Boxer Federation (IBF) in the weighted category up to 57.15 kg last Friday was completed with the victory of Magali at the 12th round.
Brown fell into the hospital with brain damage.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was attached to a life insurance device.
Brown won 22 victories at the professional race, suffered two injuries, and one battle ended.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second case of the summer outlet among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Brandon Smith, died of cancer.
AMA now recommends not to take this kind of sport, but rather, from its point of view, to prevent it altogether.
I understand that this is happening indiscriminately, said the vice president of Steven Pernis.
But as the box now exists, there will always be situations when a sportsman receives a blood transfusion or brain injury that leads to either death or serious injury.
For that reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that combines practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naruchkin called on the PA OBSE to abolish sanctions against the RF parliamentarians.
Mr. Spicker, Mr. RF. Sergei Naruchkin, called for the illegal introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said this at the PAS session of the OBSER in Ulan-Bator.
We appreciate this as unacceptable actions, such as the fall in the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political intolerance and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue.”
In addition, Narachkin invited the OBSE participants to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's go back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to practice in the international community.
Let's return humanitarian ideals to democratic peace order.
"Two times never ended well," he said.
In a speech from the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian Assembly invited parliamentarians to gather an inter-Parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"Firstly, by resolving the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-Parliamentary group," Narachkin said.
He also noted the need to give due attention to the OSCE.
"It is almost the only common area where they still discuss how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the policy stressed.
The session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan-Bator and extended until 18 September.
He's been blessed with a couple of days.
The champion of peace on the smooth Attic of Sergei Shobenkov.
This season can be called a triumphal event for a 24-year-old bat from Barnaul Sergei ShuBENKOVA.
He was able to stand at his ground distance 110 metres from the barrier to win the European commandership, to set up several records, and to become the champion of peace, the first in history of the native barrier.
In addition, a sportsman has recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, generally taking a third place.
The "New Events" asked Shubenko to share the impressions of the current season.
Sergei, is the season not over yet?
Yes, I am going to talk to the World War Games that will take place in October in Korea, and then I will think about breathing.
True, I'm going to be home right now in Barnaule, and being home is all the same.
It's easier than a week to fight for peace.
You've said something that tears are a favorite time of year for you.
By the end of August, September began a wonderful time.
After the main start of the season, the debt of responsibility is no longer paid.
It's a pleasure to have a "fashioned" party.
Plus, you know you'll be leaving soon.
What about old age?
So the season is special, the mass of positive emotions...
The stability at the end of the season is always afloat.
And it doesn't matter what he did more - he won or lost.
Every conversation is a stress.
The constant flights, the journeys - all of this is not going to happen to the body.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now I have a feeling, of course, on the floor.
That's where I'm just happy!
When they finish at the Peace Championships in Beijing, do you often come back?
He's alive.
Yeah, you journalists, don't let me forget this.
But in fact, I think that the evil of the sportsman who lives with the old wins is spreading his successful escapes again and again.
He's been blessed with a couple of days, and he's got to move on.
Has the preparation of this remarkable season been far different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We were ready to start in December, but I missed the winter season.
He started home in Barnaule, then at meetings, then back home.
It's just as usual.
But with the trainer, I'm going to try to get to a new level I haven't been there yet.
Most winters were spent on setting up a base.
We had a bunch of cross-sections, exercises on general physical training, which included weight, and presence, and we had to walk back and forth.
Then they were trained for barbaric training, and they were very involved in the technique.
So, what do the opponents say, follow?
I'm always trying to do this, and there's no problem with the Internet.
He saw the winter champion of Europe, and there in the barbaric morning all the pedestales took the French!
He thought it was necessary to do something to make this company fun.
With every start in this season, you bought and bought.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons that are made up of about the same scheme.
It's not like I ran into 13.20 and then it's 13.50.
I'm always rolling my shape down slowly.
The main thing you wanted to do is avoid 13 seconds.
All the work was directed primarily to this result.
But the paradox of how you feel is that it's ready to move, and it's not always possible to show your readiness.
How was it, for example, on the Olympics in London?
I, if I'm honest, that semi-final escape (Shubenkov couldn't get to the end. "NI") was trying to get out of here right away.
It was really good, I could actually get out of 13 seconds.
Even if you were to repeat your best score at that moment, you would be a brand-new gamer.
But it didn't work.
Remember your first champion of peace?
How's it going?
It was in Taghu.
I really wanted to get to the end, it was such a program.
And he went away from the morning in the early hours of the morning.
Then he realized that breaking and carrying a broken head means that no one will ever escape.
Two years ago at the world champion in Moscow, he's already gone to the end with a better time.
I well remember my feelings in front of the decisive escape: I wanted to win gold!
How can we avoid losing our head by developing a similar speed?
And here's the most difficult thing.
It needs to be very accurate, focused on technology so that you don't lose your barrier.
He noticed that when you're suffering, not because of the result, but because of the process, it's so much easier.
And the only blow when you feel like you're running away is you're gonna get yourself!
Honestly, that's right.
Many of our planes from the depths after the first major achievements are trying to move closer to the capital.
There's never been such a thought?
It's better at home.
I don't even think I'm where I'm without my coach, who I need?
Maybe it'd be nice to have a better condition, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
C Kleevs, you've been together for a long time?
From 12 years of age, from the time he came to a light airport.
At first, I was trained by his wife who worked with the children, and then she already handed me over.
I started out in the morning, then in the long spring, three.
The children's multi-wars were -- it was when they put the sword, they're beautiful in the distance from the place...
In 14 he tried to escape with the bartenders, and I liked it.
The first requirement was to comply with the second level of growth.
That's it.
No fear of the barriers ever happened?
It's been a while since I got to deal with them.
But there was always much work to do.
How much he suffered over an hour ago!
But there's never a kid out of this routine.
The technique has to be constant - so I can wake up at night, I'll get up right away and run through the bars.
Everyone who saw your escape in Beijing says it was a very beautiful escape.
Thank you.
I liked myself.
I don't usually look at my escapes, and I couldn't stay here.
But there are no limits to improvement to work on the effectiveness.
Don't you fear now that the victory in the year before the Olympic Games is on the shoulders of heavy cargo?
As they say, I try to justify my expectations.
Once he chose this road, he must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you're not weak, no additional burden should be felt.
And I'm absolutely in agreement with him.
Old Kushanashiville
Well, I'm not so upset that I'm surprised by an interview in Ukraine.
People are confused, I understand, their bread isn't raw.
And although I wasn't covered by the flag, and at the same time, I spoke here a million times, and I didn't call anyone directly.
All my dog friends are dead in a second.
Presing, to whom I'm so strong, that even I, who looks like a guy, think people are tired.
It's a joke, it's a joke, and it hits you so much and we're gonna blow your fingers.
But I need to know, I'm not a roommate, I'm a bitch, I'm an old man, I'm a kid, afraid.
Another case is no support.
I don't have any illusions, but now...
I've always had the best self-sustainment I've ever had.
And giving passports like Fred Derst or Monson can only be a trap.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a workaholic.
Last week in Kiev, Otar Kushanašvili described the Korean events in a rare way:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexie.
I believe that the reference to the undermining of the Cross is not in any way in the overall picture of human society.
It's like coming to the neighborhood and taking his apartment...
The war from Kremlin went, and it's only going to end there.
I'm practically 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it started with a call from a blind man from the Kremlin.
I have a guess who it might be...
Cobzon isn't so much alive.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to bend Putin's hands.
What's he losing his apartment?
Well, get him a memory.
Of course, people remembered him as a disappointment to their little family.
And the reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven leads in the race despite the attempts of the Nine to expose the missing leaders at Today Show
The release of Carla Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to explain the impact of the Liberal Party's statement on the release of the leader's seat has not been able to make a strong commitment today.
The ninth show was broadcast from the capital of the State following the explosion of Malcolm Ternbull Toni Ebbot.
Contest Sunrise, led by David Kokh and Samantha Armitage, was shot in London in a weekly series of international news, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture seemed to have no significance for Australian TVs, since Sunrise's audience included 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to today's, 339,000.
Today there was slightly more than its rating in Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but its figures were lower than in the previous quarter (343,000).
Today's falling apart with Sunrise in the last months.
In August today there were 318,000 compared to 330,000 on Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, between 40,000 and 50,000 were broken down.
By September Sunrise had 349 000 spectators against 314,000 today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament today, children!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was the stirring debate of 800 Words from the former series of series Packed to the Raffers Eric Thompson.
A new drama about the recently married father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics have argued if Tomson could deal with a popular show alone without the stars of Raffers Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday's night is a terrible answer to yes.
The X Factor Seven remained in strong positions with 1,136 million audiences, easily sold The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seven there was a failure and failure on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television station Andrew O'Kifi collected 446,000 viewers.
The second round (from 17:30 to 18:00) drew to 623 000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuarar (63,000).
On Monday evening, the first time Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second time 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will force the Nineteenth Secret to recognize that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30 a.m.
Chase Australia is a million dollars minute replacement that failed to replay McGujar show.

Three finalists agree that Sam Wood is an ideal guy, but who will he choose?
Does the secret reveal?...
Lana Jeffon-Fellous, Sarah McKay, and Snejana Marcoski, perhaps accidentally let them know who's winning in Holostajka.
The woman with whom Sam Wood is at the end of the end is in Holosta, surrounded by a secret.
And the three that come to the finish of the girl, of course, will be the silence of the one who received his last thought.
But when we met with Saro McKay, the snowy Markoskee and Lana Johns-Fellows on the day when the three girls were to stay, they may have given an unexpected indication of the winner's fate.
Sam Wood keeps the silence to the final itself, which will be held in Thursday
All three women come to a lyrical mood, explaining why Wood was an ideal man, who was reminded of his sense of humor, goals, family values, as well as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his satellites.
But in their answers to the question, "If you don't, who's gonna get the last rose of Wood?" they could hardly point out which one of them really touched the heart of "Holostya".
Jason Fellos and Marcoski no doubt called Mackey an ideal couple for Wood.
From the first day on, Sarah and Sam had a good relationship.
"Since I've been a participant, I've felt the energy (Saray) and the energy of Sam, and understood that they are very suitable for each other, and for the rest of the show there was no doubt about it," said Jason Felloz.
"Sara is a very open man, with her easily and happily," added Marcoski.
I've seen them together, there's really a connection between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sara Mackey thinks Sam Wood's gonna get a great deal of money.
McKay himself said that thanks to her house witness last week, she realized that Wood might be the "the same person".
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was not just a game - I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
The question of who should choose Voodoo, if not her, has been answered with a terrible answer.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I love both girls, and Snejana and Lana deserve it equally.

There were a number of options in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in his move to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent applications after the impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Han chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would leave China in the castle of the rest of the game for the loss of a sword, which the former game of the Australian Regiment allowed for the first return of the Panta to the winning game with Minnesota with account 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in her game and gave Hein another chance to return the paint, as well as to engage him in the game after the tragedy of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed up with a good side and after the game, in the dilapidated.
Instead of setting up a division of news in the presence of the team, he subjugated them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Haena at the press conference after the meeting.
The Special Rapporteur of the 49th Club, Kam Inman, reported that Hein also received support from the coordinator of the special team, Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost sword and think about the next game.
Jared Hann lost his sword on the back of the Panta Command of Minnesota Wickings during the first quarter.
At the beginning of this debate in NHL Hahn and his numerous Australian worshipers were clearly not counted.
It was seen that Hein was swam off the field after losing a sword, and later he told the leading show "Hamish and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not present himself as a more successful start for a career in the NFL.
"That's what happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," said Han.
Hein compared his failure to the debate in the Origin game series in 2007, when the migrating game in his accounting area led to Queensland's attempt.
In the end, this experience was very useful for the 27-year-old game.
He was photographed by the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted photos in Instagram.
Elton John and President of Russia Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of gays
In 2003, Michael Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested for threatening the use of weapons at the Siberian airport.
Open-ended challenges of President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yucos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were interrupted.
There have been contact with the police on Hungary's border with migrants.
Refugees have set up protests outside Serbia near the Hungarian population in Reske, who have grown up in contact with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water and exhaust gas, transmitted Reuters.
The migrants are shooting at police stones and trying to cross the border.
Instead of supporting the talks, the police have taken action in response to aggressive acts by migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to the Agency France-Presse, refugees were able to flee through the police corridor, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees travel from the Serbian-Venger border to Belgrade and the Croatia border, reports Bi-bi-si.
The authorities have allowed migrants to arrive in the Croatian territory and ensure that they are transported from there to the country where they are needed.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament enacted legislation on migration and border protection.
Amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of the State borders, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the rapid procedure for examining asylum-related requests.
The Hungarian court has already recognized one migrants guilty of illegal crossing the Hungarian-Serb border for which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament is also planning to consider the issue of the transfer of Hungarian armed forces to the country's national parliaments for the protection of the border.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a fence of 175 km on the border with Serbia to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees in the country.
The largest in the history of U.S. cyberattacks has been recognized by Russia.
The largest in the history of the United States cyberattack of Russia's Vladimir Drunkman has recognized more than 160 million credit cards, reports Reuters.
During the process in the federal court of New Jersey Drunkman, he agreed to a contract to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
At the meeting, the Russians discussed a discussion with three Russian citizens and Ukrainian citizens accused of cyberattacks by 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Those who respond, like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," U.S. Prosecutor Paul Fishman said.
Drinkman is a 30-year-old prisoner, as well as a million-dollar fine.
The court will take into account the recognition of Russia and may reduce its time.
Drunkman's sentence will be announced on 15 January.
Vladida Drunkmana was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitry Smilante, was arrested.
His last guilt is denied in the crimes he has committed.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risks with Russia's support of the Basar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian media, Sirgeem Lavrov, U.S. Deputy Secretary John Kerry, warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Basara Assad was intensifying the country ' s conflict.
“The Secretary of State Kerry understood that Russia's support for President Assad would threaten to undermine and expand the conflict, as well as undermine our common goal of combating extremism, unless we focus on seeking a solution to the conflict in Syria through effective political transition,” said a report published on the United States Department of Justice.
Kerry confirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the Islamic State (Acts prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
Assad, according to the headmaster, "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone discussion, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved by political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia threatened isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
The arrest of the press secretary of the White House Joshua Ernest threatened Russia's isolation if he did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed joining the international coalition, which carried out an anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
In recent times the media have often reported the presence of Russian military personnel in the Syrian territory.
The head of the Russian media, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped the Syrians acquire technology to use it against Muslims.
Fourthly, the police were killed when they discovered the shooting of giant bombs on protestors in Nepal
Four men, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, when the police started shooting giant bullets in a powder protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative in the middle said.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the area of Rupanda, about 175 miles west of Katmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had been gathered at one of the police offices, some of whom had broken stones and shooting bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police had been using the exhaust gas and then were shooting in the air before the resonance of the gas.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not surprising why rabies, which are known to be killed, are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, have caused such high deaths.
This meeting was the last of several weeks of bitter protests in the southern, northern part of Nepal, where the representatives of the Madazi people said that the new provinces formed under the new constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protesters have also gone to the west of Nepal, among the citizens of Tara, who want to have their own state.
At least 40 persons, including eleven police officers, were killed in cruel torture, beginning with 10
August, when four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, it was a very controversial issue in Nepal that had been centrally managed for several centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the draft constitution in Katmandu this week, and the officials said that the new chapter would be signed by the resurrection.
Sayansk plans to create a business at 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest town in the Irkutsk area.
It has grown in the 1970s as a chemical industry centre, which has developed infrastructure that requires systematic support.
Last year, Sayansk led a new Mr. Oleg Borovski.
As a result of the first year of work, new projects and prospects, he told the Correspondent of the Area.
Oleg Valerievic, what did you start working as a master?
First of all, I was informed of the results of the audit of financial and economic activities and initiated an independent audit expert on local budget expenditure.
The municipal property audit was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps has been the reduction of documentation for five days.
In the past, books on the institutions could be passed for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and optimisation of expenditure.
Last November, a government meeting was held in Sayansk, where social and economic development in the Territory was discussed.
There was no project-accounting document (PSD) in the city.
Without this, Sayansk was unable to participate in federal programmes.
We started training the PSD on roads, the children's garden, the North Canalization Collector and Water.
Road work in two areas is now under way.
How does the President of the RDF order the construction of children's crops in the city?
In July of that year, 105 children were born in Sayansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of safety in children's gardens is one of the most relevant.
As of 1 September, the capital of Children's Fund No. 10, calculated at 320 locations, was closed.
The cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
He never received such funds from the city.
Last year, after the repair, a child garden No. 23, which is now visited by 200 children, was opened.
The repair was made under the financing of regional and local budgets, costing more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the local Government, furniture and equipment were sought, assistance and the National Initiative programme.
There are plans to start the construction of a new child garden in 2016.
With it, we plan to eliminate the integrity of children from the age of three.
We don't have children from three to seven years of age.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must, above all, be done by the Taiwanese enterprises, namely, that they need to be provided with work.
In October, 60-square house for orphanages in the Leningrad micron.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarja, which has entered the economic-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections begins in the near future.
In all, we have announced the construction of 10,000 sq.m. of the population of those wishing to participate in the programme very much.
One of the conditions for living must not be nearly 30,000 rubles per square metre, and this value is "under the key".
If we deal with the estimated levels, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
The Sayan swine complex, which was sold in 2004, was built on its territory.
We're working with the Procurator for the reconnaissance of this deal.
More than the land under the federal property.
Working with Moscow, the question of the transfer of 88 g to the area of property, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality, is resolved.
He is a potential investor, ready to put in the reconstruction and launch of a project of 1.5 billion rubles.
With the release of a pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great support for the city.
Is there a social partnership institution in Sayansk?
We have a series of 140 social and economic partnerships.
There were few projects that could be implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Sensitious support is provided to enterprises such as the East-Central, the New South-West TEC, the OO Sean-Browler, OOO, the leadership of these companies is rejected for all treatment.
As soon as the City of OO "Sayan's broiler" hit the city of a child town, the Westok-Centre company had repaired a horse court where experts were dealing with children with ipatatherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles on it.
The sponsors have been able to improve the territory of the city of ZAGS.
Sponsors helped to mark the city's Day.
As in the past, good time has come to be with the participation of urban collections and organizations.
The city's airport, the Sayan poet's book, was released.
First-persons and people who have made a serious contribution to Sayanska's development have been exposed to jubilee medals.
The assessments are also involved in the work of the urban welfare fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles were directed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from vulnerable families.
How are social problems addressed in Sayansk?
The city doesn't have doctors and pedagogologists.
The provision of housing professionals is of great importance in addressing the issue of personnel.
In the past year, we had five rooms for doctors, four homes for the ministry.
We are working on a housing programme with the possibility of privatizing it over five years.
In plans, the building will be replanned, with another eight bedrooms for the pedogos.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the program "Jille for the Russian Family".
In the prospect of building a house for budgetary workers.
Most importantly, there is a job force in the city, with which I can deal with the most complex issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not cease.
The potential in Sayanska and our region is large.
A draft law on the indexation of pensions was introduced in the House, taking into account price increases.
The Commission has introduced a draft legislation on the indexation of social pensions from 1 February each year, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document - a delegate from Justice Russia - also proposes an additional index of pensions on 1 April, if the rate of growth of the living minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
The index of pensions under the existing legislation shall be issued annually from 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the resident pensioner's pensioner's pension in the RF for the past year.
The bill introduced in the lower room provides for the indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first index shall be transmitted on 1 February and the second shall be held on 1 April.
The Head of the PAOBSE stated that Mogerini was not able to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter from the High Representative of the European Union on Foreign Affairs of Federica Mogerini Spiccher PA OBSE Ilcka Canerva said that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly activities would not be allowed.
A member of the Russian delegation was informed of this at the annual session of the PA OBSE in Ulan-Bator, Nicolai Kovalev.
As TASS reports, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have been collected in support of the position of the Canervians.
"There has already been enough support," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the Head of the PAOBSE had intended to collect signatures of MPs indicating that sanctions against parliamentarians could not be imposed.
In particular, he noted Kovalev that he promised to address the problem at the level of the EU's leadership structures and to “response the appropriate petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cycle south of the Isle of Green Mass is 60 per cent
The narrow front of the low pressure area, approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern end of the Red Sea, is likely to be 60 per cent of the conversion into the tropical cycle over the next 48 hours, reported to the National Centre for hurricanes in the United States.
Another clear area of low pressure is about the middle of the Green Isles and the Small Antillian Islands, which also has a 60 per cent probability of the formation of the tropical cycle in the next two days, reports the Mayo Synoptics.
Google is launching a double-rate campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the start of a double bid campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations to help fill European countries with refugees who fled from war-distorted and united countries.
Google used a non-personal approach by announcing the campaign to collect donations in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masud, who had fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on suspicious trips and buses, we're suffering hunger, hunger, hunger, hunger and fear," she wrote.
I'm sorry.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Offers will be made to four non-commercial organizations that are involved in helping refugees and migrants: "Earths without borders", the International Committee of the Rescue, the Organization of the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million award until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief would reach $11 million.
Europe is faced with the strongest crisis with refugees since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, resulting in more than 4 million people being displaced this year.
Many have also fled from the armed conflicts of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with low-density may help surgery
The beneficial effect after breast surgery in people with mild type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to the new study.
However, it is still early to claim that diabetes with a mild fever lives longer after surgery than those receiving nonviral treatment.
"The statistics of death are not immediately shown," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in aging surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
Surgeon surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of the organisms to eat.
For a few years, baritarian surgery has shown its effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted in people with morbidity with body mass index (IMT) 35 or above.
IMT, weight measurement for growth is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above says that man has an extravagance, and more than 30 people with IMT are considered to be blind.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwani Min-Sheng General used the data collected since 2007, to compare two types of bariatric surgery - breast-feeding and gynaectomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with low vision.
The importance of ICT in those who have undergone surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMTs who received non-surgical treatment from diabetes remain at level 29.
Among those who carried the operation, 36 per cent of diabetes was completely cured, and 28 per cent were partially.
In the drug treatment group, there was only 1 per cent of total diabetes treatment compared to 1 per cent and approximately 2 per cent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LPNP cholesterol "are generally better in the surgical group," the authors say.
Researchers have also controlled blood haemoglobin levels A1s, which reflect blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Gemglobin A1c better maintain less than 7%, says researchers.
After surgical intervention, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, approximately 8 per cent.
However, the best GHG control indicators reflected by the positive levels of the A1c haemoglobin did not reduce the mortality rate for five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that received a hand-held diet, the team lost more weight (18.7 kg v 14.2 kg), increased IMT (7.4 vs 5.1) and A1s (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to total diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in part of life after five years, there is evidence of the results of the study of people with excess body mass in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy as reported by Blackstone from the College of Medicine at Finix, University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study, for people with age who had chosen a baritarian intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent compared to the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it dealt with fewer than 35 IMTs interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here, as it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in a low IMT group where there is no higher risk of death or early illness”, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should be seriously affected by tissue, as only IMT patients fall in ranges from 27 to 30.
"I think we've waited too long to force people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as long as they cover the genetic changes that run into their bodies, it's very difficult to turn it back.
In Witish, the kidnappers brought 9 million rubles out of the house.
In Mutish, slaves attacked the residents of the underground house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's shelves.
In this regard, Interfax informs the press service of the IMF.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two strangers, through the open door, entered the house on the streets of Gork, linked a 20-year-old boy to the house and, at the threat of both knifes, killed 9 million rubles and three teeth.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles committed by a criminal offence under “Rasboy”.
The ghosts from Europe are at risk of being homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg streets have the right to accommodate tourists who come to see the World Football Championship in 2018.
The rest of the guests are not yet able to obtain the appropriate permission.
Experts believe that this is a very disturbing sign.
In front of the world, the authorities must quickly consider how to expel all the guests of the city.
The "Rosbalta" partners believe that the cost of renting dry rooms will increase by 10-30 per cent, and even after the summer holiday campaign, they must be reimbursed.
The football World Championship enabled the authorities to pay attention to the status of Russian guests.
According to the law written specifically under the primacy, each Peterburg hospital must conduct a classification procedure and prove that the declared number of stars and level of service is consistent.
It is now understood that this is not possible for all: the hospitals are so afraid of checking that they often do not send documents at the request of the Federal Anti-Penterburg Anti-Personnel Service.
As UFAS Head Vadim Vladimirov said, the Department has studied 138 hotels and is now planning 34 cases for a guest, many of which have simply not responded to the anti-immopolitan response.
There are indications that the leadership of three dozen companies has been misleading by placing some of the stars in the advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that no one can be lost before 2018 on account of each number.
Officials suspect that during the football champion, the patients will take all the peterburg clothes.
Tourists can now count on 30.5 thousand numbers in the city.
According to Smolno, in Peterburg, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100-two-and-three-one-stars, 550-stars.
According to the first Deputy Committee on Tourism Development, Nana Gwichia, only 23 guests at the time had been classified, so many checks had been carried out by Peterburg.
And here is whether any such procedure has been ordered by a host in regional enterprises, who are not known to the Smolman about the wonderful situation.
There may be more of that in the past, but no one knows about it.
"The last half of the trips did not have a great deal of effort to pass the classification," recognized the Director of the North-West Office of the Russian Federation of the Ekaterina Shadskaya Tourism Industry.
This is due to a high season in which hospitals earn more money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is that no audit costs have been incurred in budgets, which can be covered by the guest, depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
In recent times, however, the hotel managers have been activated and have begun to apply for classification, according to Shadskaya.
Parents must succeed until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay taxes but still not have the right to work at the world champion.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed number fee will be set at the hotel during the tour.
The formulas for which the value will be calculated will be released in the following year.
This is done in order to prevent the withdrawal of prices from 200 to 300 per cent, as is the case, for example during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and not let it grow twice, but you have to let the clothes work.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hospitality association Gennadi Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not convinced that price fixing is consistent with market economy understanding.
I don't know how much is involved in economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better to travel without delay," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen to popular wedding hostels.
Members of the Lord have introduced a draft law whereby the wishes should be prohibited in residences.
We sincerely hope that this law will not be adopted or applied to Petersburg.
"We will stop the point of view that the hotels should be preserved," Nana Gwachi believes.
However, she said that the owner of the premises should, in any case, be prepared to comply with the Housing Code.
If the Lord approves the draft legislation, there are approximately 80 per cent of the hostels in Petersburg and there are 1.5 thousand of them at the moment.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hospitals of the North West Leonida Garbara, there are no two-and-a-half-star hotels in Peterburg, which are once and overrun by football patients, so there is a crossing on the side of the hotel with four and five stars.
The situation is similar when “75,000 pipes sit in the 80th season”.
This can be corrected as a time-out account.
Their possible prohibition is "idiotism": "I think it's weird that some people can live in the rooms, and that's why they can't come here."
If the hotel is used as a community, I agree that it's wrong.
But if you're like a guest in which guests arrive for a short time, why don't you?
Ministries risk losing a football champion and because of their lack of self-esteem.
Hundreds of small villages simply fail to go to class because they grow themselves.
By summer 2016, all the city's guests will be ordered to work.
"Companys who can carry out this procedure not much, so they will reject less paid orders from the Ministries, and will choose those who travel," said Gennadi Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of checks at the moment are significantly higher than the Petersburgs.
The reason for the Petersburg delay is linked to the permanent cessation of the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to concerted work.
Experts believe that, if all of the Peterburg hotels are not aware of the need to pay attention to the areas of the hotel and the rest of the house.
For example, 300-year-old Peterburg in town can mobilize a river fleet, so there are tourists who can live in cats.
In addition, many patients will be prepared to arrive at the train station where they can stay overnight.
"It's important not to make so many guests that they leave after that," said Gennadi Lamshin.
A large population will also be used during the football season.
Most likely, the city will create a reserve of dry rooms.
The interest rate will grow by 10-30%.
"It's obvious - the first to go to live near the stadium," noted a specialist on the development agency's rent and research in the independence of Larissa Bragina.
The price may not return to the previous level after the champion, especially in the bedrooms.
This would also contribute to the construction of new transport links in the city, she stressed.
It is also important to remember the human qualities of the bourgeois people.
For example, Leonid Garbar was convinced that Peterburg was always a hospitable town where people did not just mention the road, but could still make a mini-excursion.
There's a problem.
My dad met a family from Murmanska in 1970, a father, a mother, and two children.
There they found it difficult to sleep at night with the guests, and it was hard to sleep on the floor.
"And the pope brought them to our municipal bedroom," recalled the colleague.
The truth is, he added that there is no such thing in the city now - to call it home with a terrible and horrible effect.
But may the mistakes of the Lord, the mistakes of the Oteers and Governments have to be remembered in 2018?
Jirinov's "sil" Amurian area.
With his resurrection today, he looked at the Crowd of Jirinov in the Lord.
He did such things when our generation had just learned to trade newspapers, and so far, it is in a beautiful form.
The theme of the statement was, in a way, "the issue of the LDP against the results of the elections in the Amorian area".
Protocols do not conflict - or something; other protocols, other than signed elections, are not in the LDR, the Supreme Court of Justice.
He raised up the second place of 'Ishan Abra'a, and cried out: "Here is the victorious one!"
And here's nothing to mention at Rodney, and then, after the fire with the president, you're getting a fraction out of the meeting room, literally, "You're all with the fronts of your balls and doors."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abram, but on the scandal and demarcation of the factions as a result of this scandal and harassment.
The real Wolfovic was beautiful and elegantly dislocated to the Amurian area along with Abram.
For the whole country, this is a regular exit to the "Podonkas" style, not a political party protest against the results of the specific elections.
And the fraction has been formally promoted, and the elections, if you believe the party website and the Facebook page Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the issues is obviously coming down.
He gives the dead to Amura himself to bury his dead, and he himself blesss against the "One Russia" in general and in no way owes to Rodney.
It's a good decision not to lose a person, and in this case, not to go to a show.
Another thing that is now being done in a foreign situation is that of Abram himself.
In addition to coming from the government, he did not expect anything, but he did not have alternative protocols on his hands.
It is not in the public interest, on the one hand, and on the other, it has become a formal cause and an insult to a respected champion, and that it is still a circle of domestic emissions to the ER and UNF.
And, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because of the main benefit of the elections, policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 in the single area, it can be converted into a money that has successfully been used by its own party leader and supersupply for UNFPA itself and the foreign party leader.
This would not have been Jirinov. It should have been thought of and looked closely at him.
It's still growing and growing before him.
There was news that the LDR was returning to the room during the next plenary session.
It's a bathroom with nothing at all.
Only Abram's subject was buried.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for the end of violence in countries that were native refugees.
The question of the continuing refugee crisis was raised at the opening of the Dalai Lama Co-operation Centre in Oxford, on ethics studies, at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He stated that in existing circumstances the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this was a source of excitement, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he noted in his own words.
Although Dalai Lama was highly critical of the actions undertaken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary decision.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you must think about long-term decisions, such as bringing this world and this development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to violence, Dali-Lah also commented on the actions of George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist acts, stating that the violent reaction of the United States had led to a series of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in the letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem could be through non-violent.
I know that his intentions were blessed, but he used force, and that led to unexpected consequences," Dalia-Lam said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children exposed to hand-degrading for the past 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported an increase of almost 400 per cent since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who had declared a high-performance instrument, as reported by the state-of- Georgia toxicological centre.
According to Dr. Gelorda Lopes, director of the state of Georgia’s toxicological centre, children up to 12 years of hand-deficiency fluids reported in toxicological centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children contact these substances more often, and unfortunately some percentage of them are sent to the emergency office”, said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children drink dissipating fluids in particular, while others do so to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Youtube's video shows that adolescents drink a defining fluid as a drink.
Adults are reported to have mixed dissipating fluids with perspiratory fluids in order to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the pleasant aromas of desiccantizing fluids.
"Rebeck doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopes reported.
Many of the most attractive (designated hand-drawn fluids) are those that are aromatized.
There are dissipating fluids for the hand with a shower of a bottle, a vineyard, an apple that is very attractive for children.
The dissipating fluid for hand contains from 45 to 95 per cent of breath.
Young children, in particular, may be subject to alcohol abuse.
"It's a high concentration switch," said Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr. Steven Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicological center at Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a bottle of whiskeys, but people would keep these dissipating tools for their hands, and if kids get to them, it's a fast way to use a lot of alcohol.
Najana Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently launched a hand-defining device with a club room, was sent to treatment in the emergency department.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179 times more than that of an adult who is legally considered to be in the state of alcohol abuse, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, a medical doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
She found her word and couldn't walk when she was sent to the emergency department.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate child clinic so that she would not miss any signs of brain damage, as the girl fell asleep and hit her head, Ritchi said.
"It was terrible," said the CNN Order of Scott, mother of Naggy.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-ferrous substances or disinfectants, in addition to removing disinfecting fluids from the children ' s reach area.
In addition to alcohol consumption, some dissipating fluids are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the disinflammation of a toxic unexploded ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol as a deadly agent rather than an oil spirit, which has been identified as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the north of New York spoke to pick up their "opposite" teacher by "dispersion of antibacterial substances in the classroom", according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy on the hands of the deinfectors, and she prevented them from holding them in her class.
The police consider the failed plan to be “free of speech”, and address the issues of discipline in the school area.
As the oldest child library in Barnaule became a family club.
On the back of the stairs into a remote child library, the N.K. The Red Cross is a strange snake.
The kids who come after the books try to get her in touch with the confections.
A number of generations have walked in this library for 95 years.
The first readers of the 20th century had been arrested here by large readouts, placed on the streets of Moscow, conducted literary victors, and reregistered with Lenin's wife.
The census continued for four years, and, as the Journal of the United States wrote in 1939, each day “the partnership between the Hope of the Constantine Crowd and the Friends of the City’s Child Library of Barnaul” became ever stronger.
Hope Constantinov even sent his child photo to a distant Barnaul friends once.
And when the Barnauls asked if he did not object to the hope that the library would bear her name, she wrote that she did not.
The letter was long written in the museum, and first - century readers had to explain that this serious profile was improving the library building.
In the years of the revolution, people often called on each other, wondering, ‘ Why is the library not renamed? ’
Let the library name a good child writer, without a political grueling!
The library staff moved, thought, and decided to leave everything behind.
It's the most famous and popular library in Barnaule, like the Leninca in Moscow.
On the ground in the library is a road from a hot tub.
"Volshebnik of the town" is a favorite subject of artist Ollie Moscow.
Earlier, Ola was the manager of the legal company, came to work at eight, went to five, and only love for rice was distinguished from all the other managers.
And then there was an announcement on the Internet: "There's to be an illustration for books."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "In my mom's cancer."
Ola did the illustration, and she thought that life could end at any time, and no miracle in it would be unless you created them yourself.
She now works in the library, pictures the books of the authors of the world, and reads the stories for herself.
Traditionally, children are considered to be losing interest in the book, that they live more and more in some virtual space...
But we're going to read children, and their parents understand the importance of reading, and the director of the library Tatyana Kushvez tells us.
In recent years, we've even had such a moment of confidence that a child library needs, and it's gonna live - kids come here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
The library has a large exhibition exhibition with an updated photo exhibition.
In the neighborhood, new photos of readers are being taken from the library of the entire family: Mom, Dad, and children.
The library is happy that the popes have been increasingly with the children.
If the child has been reading all the Chukovo in two years, he needs more books at an older age.
Now, however, there is a law prohibiting the eight-year-old vanderquindo from distributing books from category 12+.
In order to obtain such a book, the children must bring it to their parents - they come back, then they return, and gradually the "Crussels" becomes a kind of family club for them.
In the library there is a treasure - a revolutionary collection of teas and vegetables, to bring to Coralenko in an annex to the magazine "Niva", the 1936 "Murzilki" under the heading "Murzilki".
Now we're not just the conceptual space of the Temple Book, we're now open for movement, we're trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, explains Tatiana Kushved.
We can come to respect, play, dance together.
We've made a game zone for the little ones. The kids just have to play, and the hand is all in the book!
Some of our parents are pregnant, and they are pregnant, and they don't want to leave.
Mothers often come with bicycles - and we are glad that they put the library first among all the other places where they should come with the little ones.
Tatiana Kushvet says: Modern children like us sometimes like classic children's literature:
“The issue is now being developed, and a lot of attention is being given to authors who are related to generations.”
And when talking about little children, it's important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to the other.
Children don't like to hang out with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes books for parents that discuss what is happening in a child’s literature, which should be taken into consideration and why.
The booklets are so exciting and exciting that adults are interested, but this library is not for them at all.
The provision of books outside the reading room is prohibited by adults.
It's just a privilege for children.
...In the next room of the library there is a square hole with an old wooden garden in the basement, in the library.
The steps will be signed under your steps - it's a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood, you're meeting with your old friends. Hey, good thing we don't change.
Ellie's still on the road, with the irony-sharp, the Tola Rizikov's flag is turning the bells, and Malchis-Kibalchis has not told the cursed troops of the Army of Thailand, so he has a strong word.
Books like passwords, you can find them everywhere.
There are in the storage room and these books, for example, a revolutionary collection of bones and soils.
Or bring Coralenko to the so-called "Nava" magazine.
Or "Murzilki" for 1936.
The time came for the pages to be filled with tea.
This publication is not for sale.
It's the difference of our future collection, and I'm all dreaming that I'm going to go to retirement and take a lot of kids' books.
But kids don't act like that. And the beauty in the old books isn't very bright, and the themes... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the communist.
Now it is said, why did we all write this "Pionary Truth"?
But everything was equally interesting, says Galina Ilasova, who holds the library.
The "Murzilki" pages have been down from time to time.
Galina Vasilevna is taking over her entire life.
She knows what color ball in Buritno, what year of school Harry Potter became the captain of Griffindor's team at the speedy champions in which Carlson uses the speaker for the bike, and who works for the father of Alice Selesne.
The library pays a little, and all who can live without these books are very quick to find another profession.
Only the most reliable are the clergy, the pedagogues, the cults of books.
They can still be identified as a soft spot - it is thought to be a professional picture of a child librarian.
If he kissed you in the first minute of the conversation, it's professional.
I really like the children's books: I like the library so they're gonna be to stand on the floor, and I still like to read them, says Galina Vasilevna.
I read everything: military, historical, statements, fantasy.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think my childhood was different.
The books were the most interesting and touching of all that happened to me then.
And just as I loved them for no reason, I was told that the library was a garbage dump.
And I wanted to work where everything was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the rides.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring children and grandchildren...
Hearing table: Seltique has no differences
Griffits examined the differences in Seltic after Dail admitted that Hups was in a bad situation, but he would correct it.
Harts will protest against the claims of the Scottish Football Association to Nelson, and Warberton is afraid of signing contracts in January, which may violate the unity of the team.
Dons have increased the advantage of Seltic up to five points.
The Adam Runi Peneletti in the first team gave Aberdinu a little advantage over Hamilton in Pitttódri, which allowed Dons to leave Seltika for five seconds.
Griffiths survey discussions on differences
This led to hearings of differences in Celtic, which were interrupted by Griffiths, who said that he and his teammates were not suffering any more from any stronger criticism, preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling pressure, I think the games are trying to get him.
The Dutch are cute because the Scottish are not fighting for the title - de Bur
An ex-rapporteur from the Rangers and former member of the Dutch congregation, Ronald de Bur, said that Dutch football patients had lost interest in Seltique because he did not meet for the title of the Rangers.
De Bur, currently the representative of Ajaksa, said: "In the Netherlands, the most attractive moments of the game "Seltica" are no longer displayed, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what interests them.
In the Old Company games there's a lot of pressure, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronny Dale acknowledged that Seltic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach was trying to change everything.
According to Malmyo, and as a result of the release of the League of Champions, he was soon followed by the 10 footballers Aberdina, who are now leaving the top of the table for five hours.
However, Dale said, "The Selitka has been a bad time before, and we're going back."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand it's very boring, and there's no people very, very bad or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really need Seltic support because it's getting a lot better from this game.
Staying together now is so important.
Werberton is waiting for January's transfers
Despite the views expressed last couple of weeks ago that he had determined some of the objectives of the January transfers, the Ranger boss Mark Warberton was a distrust of the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
Former attacker Brentford stated: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
As for games coming in the summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season to adapt to what you have seen in our own group in this season.
The command is really good.
Sometimes it is more harmful to add unnecessary toys to what you really need.
A mouse interested in Seltik made it possible to finish a career.
The attacker "Sunsy" Michu, associated with Seltic in a transfer window, pointed out that he could leave a football after the end of his contract with "Lebeds".
The 29-year-old game suffered from a boating problem for two years and could not leave Wales this summer.
Harts are going to oppose SFA on Nelson's statements.
"Harts" said with account 2:1 when they removed Patterson, and they started playing 3:2, but the beautiful protector's card was later cancelled; this is the third gold card Colum, cancelled in eight months.
Nelson did not reject his words, claiming: "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths tried to escape Tankkasl.
The direct player of the Hybernian team received an answer after he admitted that he had sung a song with words of horror about the former game of Harts Rudy Skace.
The incident took place in the Papa in the Roseburn region in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Deb at Taincasle in March 2014.
"It was a pig, and it was a fire," said the attacker, adding, "I can't be sure to say that I wasn't going back to Tankasl unless he was playing for Seltic."
Donnelly: Tannadis Council is confident in the "Daddy Union" management
Simon Donnelly claims that the Board of Directors of the Danish United Nations is still convinced that the management team will change the situation for the better, but it is agreed that the deterioration in the field should be completed.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We're ready to go out again," Donnelly said.
Machines is glad he won "Nice" at Hamilton.
Derek Macinness acknowledged that his command "Aberdin" had come unexpectedly to fight Hamilton Assisis to win the seventh victory in the premise, which placed them at five o'clock above Seltika, on the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's first team panel.
McInness said, "There's no team here that would win anything - a cube, or a church champion who didn't win a meeting like that."
The unemployment rate among the Scottish is not changed when it is generally growing in the United Kingdom
BEZROBOTICA in Scotland remained at the level of 164,000 people for the period from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased in total from 10,000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was above the level of the United Kingdom in 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell to 12,000 in three months, while the number of workers is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has decreased to 74.0%, above average in the United Kingdom by 73.5 per cent.
Minister for Scotland, David Mandall, commenting on the latest figures, noted: "The Government ' s long-term plan laid the foundation for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland decided to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the employment and unemployment market in Scotland.
Why I'm a witness to the murder in Oklahoma
Today, by removing legal interference at a later stage, I will see how human beings are being punished.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a paramedics camp in Oklahoma, where Richard Glossip will be punished with a death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
About that day, I became afraid.
Why do you do that?
I agreed, as I thought it was a good way to tell the story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique race.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the U.S. executions, and since those who want more than a place, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be elected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press stations decreased from 12 to five.
Whoever was chosen, he'll look at it with no emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've had our own relationship with him after a few months of telephone calls and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to take a block and a hand to write what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me in Twitter of my incompatibility.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes to get access.
I'm sorry about her.
She admitted that she herself could "be better prepared", but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with anything I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international edition journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that light will help him to stop the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the subpoenas I wrote.
I'm not going to be here in detail again.
I can't say I'm sure Richard Glossip doesn't blame you.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treize are responsible for the crime.
But I believe there is a great possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the death penalty was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And I'll see how he's going to die from this race.
I can't say I'm going to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
From me you know what it is to see how the person I love dies without need.
The police have agreed to escape from the Canning River
The construction of the Canning Valley has been able to negotiate a man's escape from the Canning River and to remain dry.
Mr. Perta intended to leave the police, but he did not suspect that he had been shot in the cold water in a few meters by a police officer trying to "can get him out of the beach".
The Kanning-Villa police were called on Tuesday because of the illegal arrival in a foreign territory in Bakingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by breaking into Canning.
But he didn't walk away.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, catch me," said senior Sergeant Chandelle Casldian.
The construction of Laklana Perhavez did not have a strong desire to make shape, so he used a more secure approach - "precise talks with the good police".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said senior Sergeant Casldian.
The football champion, Ben Kazins, just remembered that.
In 2006, Kazins entered the kitchen to avoid a meeting with the police patrol to check on the alcohol, and he tried to resuscit Soon.
His efforts were violent, but the locals were forced to create a bathlon Ben Kazinsa.
Peter Mudi accuses the guards of attempting to spy and threatens to leave the horse sports
Peter Mudi accused the studs of Racing Victoria of trying to introduce a spy into his horsehouse last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His mission became studs and staff of the Racing Victoria Ethics Division, which he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai's old-age, because of the violation of the rules on the use of medicinal products on the day of the start, was the last of the novelty.
Mudi told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the jumps, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of the Leader's attempt on the football field, which he could not explain.
He kept the language of suspicions in the hospital for a year and didn't want it to look like a green vineyard.
"I haven't done anything to say about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it's just getting you out of the car that you don't stop anymore," Muddy said.
They know it's gone.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today, and I'm going to get some sleep.
I want to walk with a very high head and I want my owners to know - I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think that's not true, I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Mudi sensibly said during an interview with raceng.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
"A year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart lived in a room with a man whom I call if they ask, and offered him a job in my horse shop to share information about what I'm doing in a horse shop," Mudi said at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a mouse.
If so, they should all make statements, as my attempt to understand me failed.
Robert Rollston, former President of RVL, David Mudi, current President of RVL, and Bernard Sondy, former Executive Director of RVL, knew about this all the time and they know now.
Shouldn't that make me think that the case is personal?
Should not RVL have the courage to respond to what is happening in this business, other than trainers?
Am I bad for this profession?
Is that how I'm bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they need to get me a license and get me out of here, and I'm not sure what I'm talking about right now can make them think about it.
But now I've come to the point where I'm all equal, and that's what's gonna print me.
I'm sorry about this.
I will impose pressure and pressure on them for decision-making.
I have support from the family, and I can go.
The trainer's arrival only grew during a long investigation of the case with Cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of the bads from the start made him claim that he could "remove his license on the table".
Mudi, more well aware of the preparation of the infamous Black Caviar champion, called for the use of medical equipment on the day of the “smokers” harvest after the crackdown on the feet of the wicked, which was a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules of jumps.
"I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my wrong employees gave her a knife.
She could get a confession last night.
She could've got it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the escape.
Judi may be disqualified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medicinal products on the day of exposure to the compression, which has led to the discovery of the investigation by the institutes.
It's an anecdote.
People who create these rules don't know anything about bad things.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Mudi.
The driver who visited and hid from the event site in Kbrama was arrested
The police arrested a man who, on the way out, had stolen a motorcycle in Kbrama and had fled from the scene.
Motorcyclists were brought to the airport in the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after his car broke down at Murray Valley Hayway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver went away, not staying to help an injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, 50-year-old residents of the town of Natalia were sent to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will be charged with leaving the scene, refusing to provide assistance and in violation of other road rules.
A 40-year-old motorcyclist lives in a stable hospital.
Melburn Storm Trainer Craig Bellami vying for opponents in the use of violent arrests
Coach Melburn Storm Craig Bellamy called his team's reconnaissance criticism as a "reconnection of the agenda" by the two favorites of the NRL champion.
"Sidnne Rusters" Trent Robinson said the judges allowed the Storm to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of "Storma" at the end of a qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Trainer "Brisben Broncos" Wayne Bennet made a clear goal on "Storm" after his team won the final qualifying tournament at "Nosern Queensland Caubois" on Saturday, when he called this game "typical" for the religion of the regime and said that two of the Queensland team were not "very successful" in the handshake.
Bellami protected the sword from being captured by his team and said that they were just focusing on the "contact" of the captured sword.
Bellamy added that he was convinced of the criticism of his team by the two leading trainers, since this meant that they would be worried about a possible breach of the Storm.
"That's still impressive - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about harsh receptions when they were playing with us with account 24:2," Bella said in the middle.
I can order that we have not changed anything throughout the year in our systems or protection techniques, just for the past six weeks, we have given special attention to contacts when the sword is caught, and this has become a turning point for us.
The train has been there for three years, and it is clearly training a great team, so he is probably not used to playing, and this has become a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always turns out at this time of year.
Bellami shared Bennet's idea of a "flamming football" by reminding his teacher that "St. George Illawarra Dragons" Bennett won a championship in 2010, showing "fucking" football.
Wayne's talking about a catch-up football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening, and to see how impressive their game was," Bella said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George had no criticism, calling a team of thieves, and Wayne said it would never matter to him.
But now he has a command that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially for his young defenders with their speed.
It's a football that you'd like to play when you have such games.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two advocates like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play that way.
This gives me more confidence, because they say these things because they're a little worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they played big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storma" and "Rusters" were associated with a larger number of shots than the game "Broncos" and "Caubois".
The game Broncos, probably, was good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was it? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts-- and what, is this really an impressive football?
Or consider the impressive breakouts and failed attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
At the end of the week of departure, as they won the right to accept either North Quinsland Caubois, or Colonel Sharks, the next Saturday evening at the preliminary finish at AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be on sale on Tuesday morning.
Indicted in the custody of Serbs, $200,000 was released
A man who threatened the life of a man who was trying to bring 40 kg of cocaine to Queensland's counterband was released at a deposit of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, was one of five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the island of Solay, who was traveling from South America through Vanuatu and who was repatriated to Kummer in August.
All morning, Maxmovic and his colleagues were on the dock, and later he met them at Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Despite the fact that Maximovic was in danger of a life-threatening attempt to take drugs into the quantity available for sale, the counsel of Maximovic claimed that evidence of the last attempt to steal the whole party was missing and that the man could be in the coffee without any effort.
The Supreme Court's judge, Peter Fwanagan, doubted that Maximowich was supposed to leave under oath.
Last contact with Serbia is available.
He's often traveling to Serbia," he said in court in the middle.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
The mother and father of Maximovic were offered a joint loan of $200,000 for his release.
“It is evident from both of them that the amount of $200,000 is too large for them,” said Judge Fwanagan.
However, one such measure was insufficient to guarantee that the judge would not disappear.
The maximum permit was allowed to be released under the permit provided that it would be sufficient for both its Australian and Serbian passport to be observed in the police every day and to comply with the command hour from 6 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the morning.
Fotos Cacicaris: "To the collection of Greece which was before the last seconds."
The chief training officer of the collection of Greece, Fotois Cacicaris, gave his command after the March 1/4 final of Eurobosket 2015 from Spain (71:73).
According to him, the judge of the game made some mistakes.
It was a big game -- quoted by AFP Cacikaris.
We're ready for a great game to meet the Spaniards.
They tried to open up the defense, but the defence errors identified the trial.
It's crazy, but I'm proud of my children.
They've been fighting for the last second.
Joel Freewood: "I'll be assigned to the CSC."
C.C.A. Newsman Joel Fried said he doesn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to overcome the negative trend and finally win Euroliga in the next session.
I talked to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, says R-Sport Frieda. - Actually, I'm going to be entrusted with the functions of Sashi Kauna, who left the team, both in protective facilities and in a three-second attack from the area, and I think I can handle this.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to rebuild the central position, but I've played Forvarda more in the NBA.
Now it will be more difficult to oppose the major opposition, but I've already done so before, so I think I'll do it now.
The army had won Eurooliga for the last time in 2008.
From that time on, they went six times to Finala four, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
It's the idea that someone's got a look at the team.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its patients.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance to win Euroliga, I really think so.
He always wanted to win this title, the Muslims have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSC.
As for the mirror, I'm not a sovereign, and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before I play, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Luis Enrique: "I'm going to have a fight with Rome."
The principal trainer of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, failed to hide that he returned to Rome on the 1st floor of the group tourr League with Rome with special feelings.

I returned to Rome a few years later, after receiving a certain experience. - The official website of WEEFA quotes Luis Enrique.
I have a very warm memory with Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start in the League of Champions with a victory.
The Augustal meeting of Cuban Johanna Hampera does not affect the action of the team in the near-match.
I'm waiting for Rome's game that she showed in the A series against Juventus.
It's a strong command that can press and know what to do with the sword.

How to play with the Great, let's see, is the official Urala website of the word Scriptenco.
We've got all week ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, many of which are being attacked, while the team is not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.

Despite the fact that the match has become hard for us, I can say that we have played well, the official website of WEEFA's word Kanyas.
Benfia is higher than class, but at home, I think, we can count on it to pick up their glasses.
That's real.
But she had to start thinking about Galatasara and then about Atletico.
In the house-to-house bags, we can pick the glasses in any place.
Raphael Bennetis: "I'll do it again as soon as possible: Christian Ronaldo is the best in the world."
The main trainer "Real" Raphael Bennis expressed satisfaction with the great victory in the 1st round of the Group Tournament League with the "Shatter" (4:0).

The mother was not easy because Shatter was able to control the sword, and the official website of the UEFA of the word Benits.
The opponent did not have a lot of moments, but their contracts always covered the danger.
I'm not saying that Real played ideal, but we had great opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the sword and killed four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world. I'll do it again.
Jordan Alba: "Christina Ronalda can't be compared to the Messiah."
"Barcelones" protector, Jordan Alba, believes that no one can compare with his sole associate, Lionel Messi.
According to Spanish, the "Real" forum of Christina Ronalda can't do that either.

Even Christian Ronald.
With Leo on the field, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniel De Rossi: Barcelona has not only unique style but also bright individualities.

The meeting will be held tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 p.m. in Moscow.
Remember, the CE will carry out its text transmission.
Barcelona is a special opponent, a good team with great games, quoted the official website WEEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue-frontiers because they have not only unique style but also bright individualities.
To leave them, we have to go through all the trouble and scare each other.
The Messiah was almost always successful when he went to the tabernacle, so we need to maintain complacency and organization.

I'm not an expert on thieves, I'm a thief, we don't have any clues about missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" was a good game, everyone had bad matches.
The command was just missing.
I'd better miss it better, but the team won.

Styvan Hogg used a girl's phone to stop pedophiles from sending photos
Pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to expose violence against children.
Stephen Hogg had taken a phone call from a girl while she was sleeping, registered in the Internet service, where she received a number of inappropriate images of children sent to her by other users.
The girl fell asleep, found a phone call, and found it in the hands of a sleeper Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photographs, and then immediately turned her mother to it.
The police came and saw five images and then studied the computers found on this address and found “relevant” requests in the search system using words to detect inappropriate images of children.
Hog then said to the police that he did it because it could "take the pedophiles" and then he would "bet he's a cop to scare them."
Judge Elid Robertson told the judge in Dandi: "He said that it was an arrest, he was forced to fear people.
He acknowledged that he had made requests to the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to arrest the police to threaten the pedophiles.
He was questioned about the conversation with an unknown person who sent images to him and what he requested to send more photographs.
He said he did it to get them out.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, cried and cried.
She saw inappropriate images on the phone, and then a clear statement was made with the accused.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused used the computer and the Pleistehn to talk to the girls who looked very young to her.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road, Denmark, admitted that he was guilty of the alleged charges of making inappropriate photographs of children on 14 June last year, in violation of the conditions of detention on 25 January of this year and did not appear in court on 24 March of that year.
The lawyer, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogga not be placed on the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it could be shown that the crime was not a “sex sexual element”.
Sheriff Alister Carmickel extended sentence until October, before receiving a response from the social services.
Hogg was dismissed under the pretext of this case, but he was held in custody before hearing of other other cases.
It was listed among the persons who committed sexual offences even before the date of the trial.
President Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is not reading this in parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, the senior government leader of Africa, had been on board this year from a shipyard that led with inspiration.
It did not hurt, but video from the fall scene was currently spread on social networks.
Parliament's opening was also angered by parliamentary opponents' statements that they had received anonymity threats from Mugabe's exposure during treatment.
A month ago, they informed the President at the time of his appeal to the nation in parliament, namely, Mugabe repeated this on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonze, a member of the Parliament of the Movement for Democratic Change, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to interrupt Mugabe.
"The message came with a number that was not reflected, but it was entitled "Death", he told journalists about the end of Mugabe.
It warned the Members of Parliament that uncertainty would end in Parliament's building, and as soon as they left, Parliament's uncertainty did not work.
Parliamentary member stated that the party led by Morgan Cwangarai was "anxious" by threats to its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduced to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its service restructuring and reduction programme.
The same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two companies registered at the branch, separating computers and printers from faster developmental hardware and service sectors.
As a result of the expected decrease in employment, some $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, is stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise company,” said Mig Witman, Chairman and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less focused and less focused than Hewlett-Packard is now, and the business portfolio will be broader and deeper, which will help the company move to the new business style," said Witman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients worldwide.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual income of over $50 billion and “will be focused on providing early in-depth technological solutions” to companies, reports the company.
The company, which was trained in the 1930s by the exhibitors of the University of Stanford, Billo Huletto and Dave Pacard, to issue electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called “the place of birth of the Kremnia Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of reorganization with a view to moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This approach of HP, second in the world by the manufacturer of personal computers and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is the latest in this sector, which is based on the conviction that the specialized companies are working better.
Captain "Arsenal" Michael Arteta says his fellows must support wounded Jack Wilshire before playing with "Dinamo Zagreb"
In his discussion with Wilshire Wenger also stressed that only September was yet to come, and that if Wilshire's restoration would be planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to Christmas.
In the most favourable development of the case, Wilshire will have at least four games in England and, in the light of what has happened, its participation in the European Championship will remain the subject of the next year.
The most recent problem was that Wilshire had probably completed the previous season with a single-trailed boat and was going back to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-school training.
Wenger: "This trauma doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not a bone that survives.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It's not about the boats or the traumas that happened before.
These may be related to the medical point of view, but, as Wenger has allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries to any game that returns to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant trend.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different traumas that occurred with him six years ago.
In addition, he played only 65 out of 157 "Arsenal" games in league for the last five seasons.
In view of the more extensive "Arsenal" schedule, it can be noted that in six of the eight seasons beginning in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, most of which had been missed for the last few days.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of an attack in the workshop, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in trauma statistics will continue in the last season.
"Sometimes, when you get back to the storm after the trauma, you've been vulnerable for some time, and then you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough and he's gonna be fine.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure he'll be the one he deserves.
Arsenal begins a campaign in the League of Champions in the middle of the Dinamo-Zagreb match and will continue to play with Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday, with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Actor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so they will play Matthew Debush and Artet as soon as possible.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kirana Gibbs and Olivia Jiru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Wolcotta.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little more attention to the games that she needs," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal has an unconditional preference in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most impressive in Europe.
"Dinamo" hasn't lost one of the 41 mothers since they got to spend the last season as "Unsatisfied."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by a 3.2-ball earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is convinced that Arsenal has taken the lesson received in the past season when the team suffered injury in the game of the League of Championships from Monaco, and remains with a weak hope of bringing the club to victory at the Kubka Championships.
"It's an amazing drive," observed Wenger.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm real.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons from a man's friendship
The lack of such stories is reflected, especially in the light of the desperate need for men in openness, now more than ever before, when the level of suicide among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of the deaths of men between 20 and 45 years of age in the United Kingdom, and men were three times more likely than women.
In an attempt to address the problem of "Campia against Unlucky Life", the 2015 Year of Men announced that men would not be able to challenge a culture that would not allow men to seek help when they need it.
The company is in the centre of this battle to deal with the challenges.
A recent study of more than 2,000 students at the university showing symptoms of depression revealed that there are insufficient opportunities for treatment if a patient has a large number of "normal" friends.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends has reduced the risk of mental disorders.
But, of course, to work, first of all, it has to be.
In the past, when communications are managed by social networks, when the style prefers content, rapid response will often be more valuable than content.
Our digital life has no doubt that we need to speak with strong, joyful, and successful people, even when the King is truly united.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values — money, immunization, social status, the whole of our internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently noted, a video player, you're not buying any more luck for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to this.
Each person was determined, not by his work, but, rather, by the personality that was manifested in the association with friends.
Yumor Joey and Chandler's constant objections, the moments of watching football in comfortable styles, Rossa's breathing on Rachel - all of this stems from the understanding that men can feel that even if they often stop from studying their feelings.
As a Samaritan officer told me, "... my role as an listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal is to stress how even very few common friends can benefit."
Often, those men who call on us do not feel able to talk to their friends.
The old "live with it" is strong, as is the feeling that open discussion of problems can be taken as a weakness."
Friends one of the shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to propose longer-term workouts.
It stressed the machosome moments of male friendship.
As for my mission, the status of a stranger on the phone is helping people at a time of despair, while long-term support comes from a close family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central in these exits, where the holiday has completely restored decorations, why not take your friends to the Central Perk.
Or even better - if you see a single man in Starbucks, kiss and say "Privet."
First, do not question the benefits of a friendship.
The series Friends show comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, on #FriendsFest
Di Maria's killing the ball by helping the PSP to disarm Malmyo.
Anhel di Maria, of course, with Blasse Matthews and Edinson Kavani, celebrates the killings in the mouth of Malmyo.
Anhel di Maria, deposed in the League of Champions, killed a bullet that made it easier for the PSJ to sell Malmio on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the mother and the game's reaction.
Anhel di Maria and Edinson Kavani did their work when Pari San-German began his game at the League of Championships with a very comfortable victory of 2:0 against Malmyo at the Park de Prens Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed a sword less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions began as a game of the PSP, to turn to the French champions, but they left a number of opportunities before they finally increased their privilege when Kavani killed him at 61.
In addition to Real Madrid and the Dutch Shafter in Group A, Paris had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they were not intended to qualify for playoffs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they arrived at the four-finals.
They worked on the shots, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Loran Blan to consider the gold of Ibrahimica as useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field against the team from his hometown and club, where he started his career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a home or a guest in the League of Champions, so to win with account 2:0, to bring the opponents problems and to play excellent in defense - it's a good start, even if there are still moments we need to work during the season," said Blan.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I regret that we didn't kill one or two more cats.
Ibrahimovic returned after the trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing with account 2:2 in contact with the Bordo First League in the east, but gave him back to the Día Maria's background plan in the fourth minute.
Argentina's attacker noted as a game that was capable of re-emergering the PSC in Europe after he was bought at Manchester Union last month, and he showed why when he fled to the Marko Verratti behind the protection of Malmyo and successfully completed the attack, sending a sword to Uncle John Willand to the next corner of the war.
However, if anyone had waited for the easy and great victory of the PSP then, they would have been disappointed.
Malmyo, who won Seltik in the playoffs to reach this stage, with nine world-level games in the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two powerful defenders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But except for the attack by Nicolas Jürdžic, with the sword flying at least a further step around Kevin Trappa at 34 minutes, they attacked quite a bit.
Thus, in time, the PSP itself was subjected to unsound transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who was unable to carry out at least five attempts, and then was unable to handle the sword killed by Kavani immediately after the replay.
However, he showed himself much wiser in the exact steps, and it was a passport from Ibrahimovic, who was sent by Día Maria with a sword tied to the strike, which had taken him to the village of Villand for 52 minutes.
The second round was finally killed after an hour's notice, thanks to Kavani, the trainer killed his sixth sword in the season after Ibrahimovic set up a sword sent to the center of the field with the left flag of Maxwell.
This led to the conclusion of any ideas that had been in Malmyo about the return to the game, and merely taking over the sword of Wildan from a nearby distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before the replacement of Escéel Lavessi was counted the goal at the very end of the match.
Trainer Age Harreide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian said, "Our last game in League champions was in December last year."
Since then, we've only played in Swedish league, not that level.
Qualifications are insufficient.
It's "Pari"!
It was a great deal with them.

White House confirms a visit to Si Chipin in Washington
The White House confirmed on Tuesday that the head of China Si Chipin would come with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit - the first visit to Si Cinpin in Washington - will be held on 25 September and will be the answer to the visit of President Barak Obama to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and the first members of the United States will also take Mr. Michel Obama and his wife, Pen Liuan, to the government feast on the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral negotiations.

Two years of colonization took place in the Kutuzskskhacht.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civilian demands of Dani Mirzoev on an amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorogomilov court of Moscow condemned Danny Mirzoev, who died as a motorcyclist at the Kutuzsk Prospekta in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in the settlement colony.

In addition, the court partially satisfied the civilian demands of 1,2 million rubles.
During the debate, the prosecutor requested Mirzoeva to be sentenced to three years in prison and to seek full-scale victims of eight million rubles.
An accident that occurred on 22 May occurred about three hours a night in the household area of 30 on the Kutuz Observatory.
The BMW car, which was behind Mirzoev's wheel, crossed the traffic field and broke the motorcycle on the ground.
From the injuries suffered by men in 1989, the birth was completed.
Friends of the lost social networks reported that the BMW driver was running at a high speed and went out to the DPR.
Fearing that the driver was trying to get away from responsibility, the bunkers organized a motorbike from the Works Mountains to the GUMVD building in Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter it was learned that the result of the investigation had been suspended by the alleged TIR prosecutor.
In Moscow, a man was arrested last night in the temple.
He was calm and did nothing wrong, and the police handed him immediate psychiatric assistance to his doctors.
Police officers arrested the inhabitants of Moscow, who had entered one of the temples without clothing.
That's what the Moscow Agency reports.
As told by the head of the Press Service GU MVD on Moscow by Andrey Galiacberov, an incident occurred on Tuesday, 15 September, about 16 a.m., at the Cashier Shoes.
In the temple, High Priest Nicolas went to the temple to get a good man.

A number of police arrived on the scene.
The nurses were expected to receive doctors from the hospital with urgent psychiatric assistance and to hand them over to their husband.
They had a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yachoev.
More than 40 decisions and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tuman region, Vladimir Yachoev, at a meeting of the regional government.
Some of them involved the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in municipal education.
In particular, funds for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Nizhnetavdin region were allocated to the capital repair of the district hospital in the Kazansk region.
As indicated in the accompanying documents, money will be spent on the completion of the capital master's second phase of the therapeutic office.
The repair of heating and cold water supply networks, water supply, electricity and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, will be carried out in the building phase, refurbishing premises, implementing a package of anti-security and energy-sustainment activities.
There is a second forum for the regions of Russia and Belarus.
The second forum for the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Société from 17 to 18 September, with the participation of the Turkish delegation in the head of the Governor.
The future event in Socia and the interim results of cooperation are described by the Honourable General Council of the Republic of Belarus, in Tumani Vladimir Shugla, formed by the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Conciliation Forum?
The scale of activity in the Council reflects the industrial policy of the United States.
It is aimed at fruitful cooperation between the regions - important barriers to relations between the two States.
It is planned that the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and President of the Republic of Belarus, will take part in the plenary meeting.
The experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, the legal and programme of the United States will be discussed in plenary and section meetings.
The Governor of the Tuman Area is represented in the forum.
I think this is evidence of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The Forum will also be attended by representatives of the ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade brands and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will work.
I hope that the Forum will help to conclude new useful contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two delegates, including 19 regions of Russia, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Turkmenistan-Ministerial Areas was signed.
The importance of our work also relates to the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumana at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of the APC to the Republic of Belarus visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarus in the training of agricultural personnel, the definition of additional focal points and the organization of new investment projects in the area of the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of the Tuman region, Vladimir Yachos, the regional cooperation with the Republic of Belarus was under modern circumstances.
The issue of the supplies of Belarus' agricultural technology and the use of financial mechanisms is to reduce the cost of the car for the final user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Tuman Trade House of Belshina and options for the prevention of losses.
Important issues, such as investment projects, should be clearly worked out and brought to the region.
Further OAO " MAZ" passenger-gross technology has been discussed, the development of the OAO "MAZ service centre, which was established in Tumani on the OAO "TPA " basis.
The discussion had also begun and prepared a visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another theme of the session was the conclusion of the agreement and the signing of the Agreement on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Cultural Cooperation in the Tumena region and the Republic of Belarus.
The dynamics of relations thus promise to take on a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the regional centre.
During a meeting with the mayor of the city of Tumani Alexander Moor, we talked about updating the Tuman bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on the floor, so a new part of Belarus is required, which will work on gas, environmentally clean heat.
Another aspect: The Tuman elevator works with one of the leading manufacturers of the OAO "Migilivliftsam", receiving integrated products.
In my view, this could become more active, taking into account the programmes for establishing new elevators at the regional centre.
I would add that, within the expanded powers, the Council met with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alex Kokorin, who was discussing the increase in goods and supplies of modern Belarusian technology in Zaural.
At the end of September, a meeting was planned with the master governor.
The enlarged consular area includes five FIFIs, but the Tumen can be called the respective headquarters of the area.
The region is a pool for the coverage of many prospective projects, including the work of the decent gender consular.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good that enables many problems to be addressed directly and quickly, taking into account their difficulties and developing mutual cooperation.
In the current context, it is vital not to destroy the task by continuing to work on the prospect.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production
Matt Damon filed with U.S. promoter Effy Brown, saying that it was not necessary to take the ethnic component into account.
During the resurrection of Project Greenlight show on HBO channel, a prominent actor crossed Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative views on the main black hero selected for the project scenario.
"The diversity is appropriate when you're doing casting for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Dear Brown, not believing in his ears, forced him to call "Ogo, nothing." Well-no" all the time until an actor from "Marsiana" made his comments in a direct ephere.
For the discussion of the finalists of the show to Damon and Brown, colleagues of Ben Afflek and Brother Farelli joined.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to wonder what harmonies they're going to keep," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black person is a prostitute who kills a white tanker.
The director of the Dear White People film said that the directors of the film became Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancachcho; Damon was very opposed, saying, "As a result, we can get what we want."
Following this discussion on television, social networks were exposed to negative comments from Damon.
The Twitter user MrPooni angrily said of the video: "The explanation of the diversity of Matt Damon's only black man in the TOKOE BELOE room is so painful."
Twit got more than 5,000 recipes and 4000 lekos.
Damon's statements appear as a time when the gradation of the theme of racism in the media is the most urgent issue on the public debate.
After a youth named Michael Brown was shot by the police in 2014, the Black Live Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the color population.
In February, Prince mentioned this movement at the time of submission of candidates to the "Album Year" ceremony at Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.

American Ninja Warrior wins the first champion.
A professional scaffolder and assistant officer, Izek Caldjero, became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday evening, leaving home at $1 million.
At this sports show, the 7th season, which had just ended, none of the participants had been able to pass all stages of the race with obstacles.
At the end of the season, two participants, Caldero and Jeff Britten, arrived at the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot-long stand stand for 30 seconds.
Britten fulfilled his first task and took on the task at the time, became the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, the last phase 4, but Kaldiro worked on the task for three seconds faster than his winner did.
After the victory with the incredible work, Caldero, who was shocked that he won millions of dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"To think about this amazingly, I never worked and lived more than $10,000 a year," commented Isaac to reporters E! such a serious cut of my income.
And on the other hand, I've never even imagined myself as... the future is unknown.
The executive editor, Kent Wiid, met with journalists The Hollywood Reporter, to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to go through, won't get any money.
According to the rules, money is received by the fastest participant.
"If there's more than one of them, they'll get the fastest of them," said Wid.
Though money is a wonderful reward and lives change, it is still a great source of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels that way.
He was happy for what he did.
He's got a ton of rehearsal calls from fans.
He's a great man and a family.
He's a hero for his children and women.
Jeff said to me, "If I'm supposed to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we changed our roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will come back with the eighth season, which will begin with the summer of 2016.
"Detrot Tigers" is secretly dealing with Minnesota Twins.
MINEPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly happy for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is now taking the last place in the Central Division of American Religions.
I'm just trying to make a deal with Tiggers, and I'm gonna win it on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins, with a 5-4 score at Targetfield.
Twins had the chance to cut off a semi-game from Houston Astros and take a second place in the playoff for the number of seconds after the winners.
For the detroiters, let it even be one night, it was the return of the word to letter F, which separated most of them from the second half of the season.
"All the winners are happy, no matter how they get," reported the Tigers Manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher Tiggers, Alfredo Simon, made his contribution to support the attack, and as a result, Detroit took three shots in the first two innings, then added one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a drinker in 6 1/3 inn and lost three wounds.
It was only his third quality start after nine.
"I just want to end the year with good indicators," said Simon.
I can't get drunk in every game, so I want to go into the game.
The appointed Tiggers attacker Victor Martines has managed to defeat three attacks and has won two wounds -- the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked very well," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (quality of mind) and was much better at fighting and kept this quality for the game.
I got three wounds in the second half of the seventh inn, Twins got their best chance to get back to the game.
The central receiver of Biron Baxton opened an inside pipe on the left line of the field.
Reetfielder Aaron Hicks, made a bond, took the first base, and the second busman Brian Dozer got a shot at Simon's take-off before he took his place on Blain Hardy's left.
Hardy kissed Moera, the only game on the way, before a newly appointed attacker, Miguel Sano, who shot a double "single" on the left from Dr. Verhagen's right.
In a couple of non-cars and a comparable wound on the second base of VerHagen, it was possible to bring a third busman, Trevor Pluffa, to the strike in the dabble.
It was the 27th time for the lead game of the highest lion in this season when Pluf shot a sword on the doll.
After Detroit added the alarming wound to the first half of the ninth inding, Moer hired RBI "dablom" in space between the autofields against the closing drinker "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the count was 5-4.
However, the right-hand game killed Sano after three shots and got his fifth seat.
Detroit used the advantage of a temporary non-professional Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers worked three times in the first two against a hired drinker, who was on the list of wounded before the game, missing more than a month in connection with the shooting of the speaker.
"I certainly didn't want the start I wanted," said Hughes, "but as the game grew, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to perform a few good breasts in the third inning."
After the first bet hit the first base, Hez brushed the second bassman, Jan Kinsler.
In two cars, J. D. Martiness took Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first time in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with the runners in a successful position.
The third base game, Nick Casteljenos, followed by a single one, took another wound, but Victor Martines was shot in an attempt to get close to the third base, so the threat was eliminated.
Tigers increased the account in the second inning, receiving one-off double from James McCanna and two-hour singles from the central attacker Anthony Gouza, and it was 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager "Twins" Paul Molittor.
He wasn't particularly good, but he fell right at the right point.
Hughes, who was thought to have been in possession of a third inhaler, was replaced by the right-hand relicer A.J. Ahter.
Hussus had three wounds on six hips and a tail with four arrow keys.
PRIMATION: Pitcher-right "Tigers" Anabal Sanchez has been released from the games due to the extension of the right wing.
He will be supervised by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's field operation yet in 2007.
For Sanchesa, which is on the list of wounded from mid-August, an early departure is planned.
In the absence of Sanchesa, Daniel Norris will leave the list of wounded and go against Tunis.
Norris, who went out with Tigers on four occasions since his acquisition in exchange for the poet David Pryce on 30 July, has won 1 and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in games since 20 August due to hair loss.
Tigers and Twins are closing a series of three games at Targetfield in the middle.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4,43) will be played by Judge Ervin Santanan (5-4, ERA 4,73).
The original complaint of Kadarov on the book "Molba to God" came to the Southern Sakhalin Court.
In the Southern Sakhalin City Court, the complainant's original appeal was made by President Chechny Ramzana Kadarova to decide to recognize the book "Molba to God: its importance and place in Islam", he reported "Interfax" referring to the president of the Gorsundra Chuhraja.
The Court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the process.
Chuhiri refused to comment on statements made by some of the members of the RDF on the need to verify the need to verify the burden on possible cooperation with foreign services and IGIL.
"Shut yourself to comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the Southern Sakhalin City Prosecutor appealed to Judge Natali Percenko for the recognition of the book "Extremist Material " .
The appeal came on Friday evening from the South Sahalinska District.
There are news: The prosecutors believe that they have asked the court to recognize the extremist only the author's opinion, not the Qur'an.
According to the prosecutor, the judge had taken a wrong decision," Chukhri reported.
The decision to accept the book "Extremist Material" was adopted on 12 August 2015.
It was said to them, "We worship you, and ask you for help." So do not call anyone besides God.
Kadarov called the decision made by the book "Satans and Provocators."
He called on the representatives of the Lord to legally prohibit judicial decisions relating to the texts of the Scriptures.
“I am firmly convinced that the Lord must adopt a law which prohibits judicial action concerning the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures directly,” wrote Kadarov in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff are intended to remove posts and comments that give negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users on an illegal continent.
Combating xenophobic and racism in the Facebook leadership network has been found together with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
Yes, the Head of the Office of Haiko Maas stated that the mission is now being undertaken in conjunction with the special group of coordinators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove incorrect comments regarding migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Masa, it is expected that the authors of the non-tolerant posts will receive notifications indicating why they were removed.
To facilitate the operational blockage of the counter-law content, the organizations that specialize in the collection of complaints from users are also required.
The Facebook Guide aims to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was taken after the Xenophobic settings had developed in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them has been the unprecedented migration crisis that some time ago covered the country of Eurojust.
Yes, in Germany, all items intended for the accommodation of refugees have already been completed today.
The pressure of the authorities has decided to temporarily move migrants to the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.

There are areas for relativization in Moscow.
In the near future, several capital libraries are equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological recovery.
The first will be the Bouttosko, Domodedo, and the Serbian Tabernacle.
The first zone for psychological recovery has already appeared at the Troekurov Square in Moscow.
Such areas will also be seen in other areas of the city.
In this connection, m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, head of the State Budget Office, Ritual.
Areas for relativation will represent small green areas that remind the parks.
In the opinion of experts, such “yellows” can breathe, get together, and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, the relativity zones will be built in the Domodian, Buttov and the Serbian camps, and then in other capital areas.
According to the GBU ' s “Ritual” chapter, when it comes to the need to expand the ceilings, the builders are trying to preserve the existing forest masses as far as possible.
Green settlements will serve as a living facility that will separate the breathing zones and areas directly below the storage site.
The GBU “Ritual” experts also stated their intention to submit a proposal to refuse the fire at the funerals.
New ceilings can actually be free.
In addition, the “Ritual” GBU reported on the readiness to set up electronic terminals, with the help of the site’s visitors to identify GPS coordinates and number of backups.
In June of that year, the Ritual GBU also proposed to adjust the value of storage services, depending on the time of the year.

In the ellynous forests, five mornings passed, and there was a crazy giraffe.
The elderly man was alive, though he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without any exercise.
The discovery of the graffiti has been thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, Correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov area spent five days in the forest."
No food and water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dogs kinologists, but there was no result.
The discovery of a man was successful after his search for work.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovic was sent to the woods for refreshments and refreshments, but he didn't come back to dinner.
The family immediately sought help, and on the next day, rescuers and non-equity residents of the neighboring village were arrested — about 30 people.
On the fifth floor, the helicopter joined the fire-saving centre.
Andrey Selekov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolens Center, said: "The helicopter was caught, the man was discovered."
He went very far, perfectly in another place.
It was about 12 km from the search point.
He went through a huge distance in his old age.
It's a miracle he's still alive.
The clinic was sent to the central district hospital without consciousness, in very difficult circumstances.
It was diagnosed with pneumonia, as well as severe nausea and vomiting.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five nights in the forest, the doctors did not represent him perfectly.
Valentina Nippsa, in charge of the therapeutic department of the evangelical CRB: "Remarkable patient investigation, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.

His grandson says that his grandfather had already gone to pick up the fish, but he was never deep in the forest.
Alexei Spitcenko, the son of one of the found Griffins, said, "The bed is far from the road, in principle it's not local."
He literally spent several years visiting his relatives.
Well, he went after the fishermen.
See, he went far and went crazy.
Since the beginning of the winter season, people have suffered regularly in all parts of the Smolens region.
Only in the last few days have five similar cases.
The rescuers remember that we have to walk in the forest in bright clothing, with little food, shoes, and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave behind traces so that they can be returned.

An extra landing of the Enisei Air Force aircraft took place at 60 miles [68 km] from Bratska.
Not those who lost and suffered, but the plane itself suffered significant damage when it landed.
An-2 has done a service trip.
On his ship were three crew members -- commander, second pilot and boat mechanic, reporting Interfax.

The engine and the boat were fired on the line, but the boat made it impossible.
Ten crew members and 72 passengers were on board.
No one hurt at the airport.
Economic News — Nobel laureate: Globalization
The process of globalization should have contributed to the reduction of inequality in the world.
The situation is different, the gap in population income in developing economies is growing, on the other hand.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-qualified workers, the chief scientist of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Evaluation of the NIWE, the Nobel Prize for the 2007 economy, Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has seen unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Globalization parties predicted great benefits for the developing economies.
"And these predictions have come in a lot," emphasizes Maskin.
Thus, for example, China and India have had a serious increase in GDP in the souls of the people.
However, not everything is so happy.
Globalization is expected to reduce the gap between the poor and the poor in poor countries, which are marked by high income inequality, and more precisely the wages of labour.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why the global markets have not reduced inequality in the developing economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by NIEW.
In conjunction with economists, Professor Michael Cremer Eric Maskin of Harvard University has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the gap in income in poor countries is increasing as globalization increases, NIEW recalls.
Specific processes are being carried out on the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maschin has assigned four levels of qualifications to A and B for rich countries, C and D to the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries do not qualify to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if workers at level C from poor countries increase their wages due to cooperation with B staff from the rich, workers in D are not able to feel or pay their wages at all.
The overall impact of the internationalization of production will help to increase the gap between the two categories of workers in poor countries and, respectively, the level of inequality.
The creamer and E. Machine offer a beautiful model, an alternative rickardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to inequality in incomes, says Fuad Alesconov, an Ordinary Professor who conducted the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making, Head of the Department of Mathematics of the NIWWE.
And as every powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to the collapse of imperial work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskina, is to improve the level of education of low-qualified workers.
However, workers themselves, as the scholar notes, do not have the means, but companies do not have the right to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, considered as Maskin.
It was noted that the theory developed did not, in any case, call for the cessation of the globalization process, which led to and produced its fruit in the form of GDP growth in the countries.

Homeside's been a business game at the airport.
They're trying a new form of education in the capital.
Four hundred students have tried in the role of airport staff.
For this reason, three aircraft models were installed in Domodeda.
Not only did young people observe and register passengers but they also served the planes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it has not been realistic.
Two passengers on board suddenly lost their trailer somewhere on the way to the plane.
For this airport, from.
A standard set of tasks that should be addressed to the news.
In one corner, three major airports from various countries of the world were set up immediately.
There are now four hundred students from the capital colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to know everything about the inner world.
Registration of passengers, service of aircraft, freight transport - even buss on the airport, trams and passenger inspection.
And passengers are at a disadvantage.
In one case with documents, the other was on the train, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.

The United States Mission regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the United States Centre ' s foreign literature library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The United States Mission in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Mission Centre at the Russian National Library of his M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps recently taken by the RFB are in doubt as to the commitment of the Government of Russia to relations between the Russian and American peoples that have not even been interrupted during the cold war and at other difficult moments of the long history of our countries”, said US Ambassador John Teft, quoted in the Interfax.
The American Centre has established a deep and lasting relationship between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as a meeting place with many American visible actors, including the space, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only in recent years has the American Centre carried out more than 400 cultural and educational activities and has taken over 50,000 Russian visitors”, he stressed.
Teft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Court was about to discuss.
Typical situation: Four officials stand before Judge Svatner Kumara, listening to his claim for work.
The court is totally not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to calm down on it, Kumar says.
If there's one more crater, we'll show you to get rid of all the existing structures.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NPT) as the judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the intense pollution of the environment that is accompanying the storm of economic growth in recent decades.
Meanwhile, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 air pollution investigations, munitions, geologic developments, toxic wastes and dumping.
In two of the three cases, the Court decided to terminate the construction that led to the destruction.
The rates are unlikely to be high: over the past 60 years since India declared its independence from forced industrial development, India has turned out to be one of the most affected and affected countries in the world.
The problem is particularly serious in large megapolis where infrastructure development does not lead to forced urbanization: the city is covered with flat mud, the rivers filled with pesticides and wastes of businesses and households, and the few remaining masses are located in new living quarters.
Despite the formal support of the Green Movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendre Modi, as it is often the main reason for the rejection of major investment projects.
Yes, in May this year, the Minister for the Environment called the court ' s decisions "extremely" and "ineffective".
Sometimes the court's decisions are really impossible to implement in the court's due time, and the counsel on the environmental affairs of Raj Pandjani confirms it.
However, incomplete decelerations also have a positive side: at least they prevent those responsible.
"His main goal is to overcome this system," adds a lawyer.
The Green Court has repeatedly rejected major attacks: the closure of the airport, power station and hundreds of smaller arms.
However, people are also trying to remember: for example, during the discussion of the judge of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Télagana, which had damaged the local network of phytoroids.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People lose their jobs," Kumar commented.
Such explanations, however, are not always understood by simple people who can change their lives by a single step in the judicial process.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles from entering the capital for more than 10 years than the national compensation.
Despite the sharp popularity and level of criticism, Svatner Kumar refused to give up this decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of the Department statistics on entry and drive transport, as well as suggested that 10 thousand additional buses be purchased, prior to being found in factories, to be able to comply with such a order.
As the Court’s attention began to reflect on such sources of pollution as dust, fuel, and even road accidents, people’s anger began to subside.
But the most painful theme of the principal judge was the clean-up programme of the Gang, with the support of Prime Minister Narendro Modi last year.
When it comes to the Gange, which is dedicated to the Indians of the river, the judge often ceases to hold his emotions and moves on to the cricket.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone who drew water from Ganga to the status of God, and there were hypocrites in it, the judge is angry.
You continue to sink the river because you think: Gang is Gang, he'll take all our sins away.
This is the river which we worship, and see what you are doing with it every day.
The cleanup of Ganga is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
Currently, the number of bacterial bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Each year, from 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million Indians die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganga Rescue Fund from the sale of his costume in which he met with Barako Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecologists have accused the prime minister of populism of spending $700,000 on costumes, while at least eight billion on the clean-up of the river are required.
The parties to the Green Court agree that India is still on its way long before it can call itself a developing country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be environmental.
"In the developing country, environmental discussions are often perceived as unacceptable growth, says an activist in the organization "Zov Ganga" Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a gold centre between the environment and development."

" China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing openness policy," he said, drawing attention to the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Committee on the Comprehensive Intention of Reform.
According to him, the expansion of openness and the deepening of reforms would give the economy a new momentum and life force and provide a new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of market access regulations for investors, the amendment of border controls, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) attracting private capital and the revision of the system of housing registration.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.

This is an important step, since it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, in ensuring business legitimacy and in increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken the control of the powers conferred on it by companies by ensuring that companies themselves are carrying out their business.
The statement also stated that China would allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for strengthening local growth.
More space will be available for private investors in order to increase the openness of the controlled State of the economy.
“The Authority will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions”, said the statement.
