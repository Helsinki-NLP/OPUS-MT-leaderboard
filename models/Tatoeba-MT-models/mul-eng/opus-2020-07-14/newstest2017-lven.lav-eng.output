28-year-old boy found dead in San Francisco University
On Monday, at a high school store, a 28-year-old girl died of a stroke that recently moved to San Francisco .
But the Upura brother said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his brother, saying, "His life finally started to improve."
On the third day at Westfield’s headquarters, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, told the representative of the San Francisco Medical Expert Office.
The San Francisco police reported that his death was recognized as a fraud and now a investigation is taking place.
Upura's brother Luis Galicia tells the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he believed in his dream at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant.
The representative of the "Sons & Daughters" restaurant reports that the news about her death shocked them and troubled them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we are very weak," said the representative.
During this difficult time, we thought we were together with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia relates that at the beginning of his stay at the hostels, Frank’s life finally improved.
"He gathered in a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia says that he doesn't know who he wants to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a broad heart.
"He always blessed his family, preparing a spiritual meal and preparing a afternoon," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in the conflict.
He was the brother who adjusted his thinking.
"In view of all that has happened in the world fast, he was like an unprocessed diamond that was dying every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
The new doctor's direction: calls for new protests
The new doctors ask their trade unions to initiate protests in the debate on a new contract.
The New Committee of Doctors (JAK) of the British Medical Association (LMA) is ready to ask for advice to support wider protests early in September.
The JAK believes that ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
58% of all members who participated in the vote voted against the contract.
In a letter published on Thursday evening on Twitter, a member of the JAK Council said that the Government continued to listen to this issue and therefore the offer of a contract was rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the proposal for a contract as a result of the JAK vote has been completely rejected and decided to request new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the Government's hearing, JAK today formally requested the meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the development of new contracts that would take place in September.
As a result of the conflict, young doctors have participated in six strikes, including the first time NHS has stopped work.
Following a vote that rejected the terms of the contract proposed by the BMA, Dr. Johann Malavana, a new LMA doctor, initially withdrew.
Before meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, health secretary Jeremy Hunts informed that the contract would be concluded with the doctors of England.
Russia and Turkey: Atttumto Alliance?
The chain that ended the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders were held on Tuesday to celebrate and announce an eight-month-long term and economic sanctions at the end of the war.
However, when Vladimir Putin met Turkey’s leader in the town of St. Petersburg, it became evident that these partnerships were more necessary for Ankara.
However, both of them were in a quarrel.
Vladimir Putina’s smile looked at the meeting and did not cause heated emotions, even taking into account his background.
On the other hand, Taipes Erdogans has at least five times denounced Putin for his "good friend", a news meeting view.
I'm sick of numbers.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the level of pre-crisis but will become even stronger.
The next day a newspaper reported that Erdogan would take it as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is causing negative feelings.
However, Putin’s violent spirit shows that Russia’s leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his conversation was that the Russian plane was crossing the Syrian border.
Then Moscow responded.
Putin accused Ankar that he had taken a shower in the forest of Moscow.
The exchange was even worse, considering that it came from a friend.
The restoration of true trust may be very difficult, even impossible.
Since November Russia’s public position has changed.
For several months, the government controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
After all, it seemed to them that there were terrible Turks everywhere.
The most serious accusations were that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade with the part of Syria controlled by the Islamic State.
Of course, he refused.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting was that it was time to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received President Erdogan's resignation.
Russia could capture it as its kind of victory.
Ankar's benefit from the peace agreement is obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all the possible friends after an unsuccessful encounter last month, where he tried to find them.
The attacks by the untold terrorists have also affected her positions.
The same is true of economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have resulted in significant losses, particularly a ban on chartering, which usually ensures several million Russian tourists’ flows to Turkey’s districts each year.
The number of tourists decreased almost 90%.
Russian travel operators and charter companies will also be able to ease the gap when regular flights are renewed.
They look forward to vacation in the Middle Sea at the end of the season.
This week, the national TV provides for a reduction in the prices of fruit and vegetables, as Turkey's imports of fruit and vegetables will be renewed.
As another local newspaper Vedemosti says: "Tours them, tomato us."
However, the visit also had other political reasons from the Moscow side.
Ankara is anxious to the West about, in his opinion, a weak reaction to the attempt to overcome it.
All can also be seen as discontent with the long-term negotiations on accession between the EU and Putin, which is well used in the situation that Turkey has withdrawn from the West.
The Russian leadership has received no doubt additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the trial.
Take into account that Moscow is well aware of this because there are serious concerns about the change in the regime.
The summit, which took place at this coastal port, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present how a analyst, "six-six alliances", together with the two countries that felt withdrawn from the West.
Despite the unity demonstrated by the public, however, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peace failure, but Russia and Turkey are actually supporting the opposing parties.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, not wanting to reveal information, the two Presidents at the press conference announced that they had not discussed this issue.
The President of Turkey had deliberately avoided the issues of non-compliance between the two countries, but President Putins wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of good relations and potential disasters when NATO member Turkey launched a Russian war machine, the situation has improved as both leaders have at least started negotiations.
Scottish Royal Bank will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SKB will continue to play a role in support, as announced by the Executive Director of the Bank.
There will no longer be access to outside Scotland's SKB.
Ross Macevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB mark was associated with bank ambitions at a global level.
It has rejected these ambitions, since the bank had nearly doubled and needed financial assistance almost eight years ago.
Until the labelling strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of tickets from international sports sponsors starting with the Six Nations regime and ending with the Vimbdona tennis champion, Andrew Mure.
However, it is now decided to draw up other national symbols in the proposal.
Scottish Royal Banana will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initiated.
In England and Germany, all references to the SKB, outside the main office and the official bureau, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank has already been used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now you will also have less private financial brands, such as Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Macevans was interviewed during the departure with customers and employees via Invernesshire.
He sent the BBC Scotia channel: "SKB will become our investor mark and our employees will work with it, as we now become more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global sign and the SKB became a global sign.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their sector, and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The NCB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor "Six Nations" and will involve various brands in sponsoring sport.
"Have you had the real time to become a brand bank, because we have already asked ourselves how to become a better bank to our customers?" the Executive Director says.
Three years ago, it would have been very interesting if we announced that we would become a great bank to our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs rather than on our own needs, we have obviously made big changes.
We can revive these signs again, so I think now is the right time.
France Detori wins 3000 wins, getting the first place in Newmark with a horse Predation
Detori draws champagne to his 3000-year-old victory, twice ending his first novels in Newmark.
On Friday, French poet Detori won his 3,000th victory in the history of Britain, gaining the first place in New York.
He achieved this by defeating the second victory in these stories that took place in his hometown, to deal with Predlection, which trains John Gosdens.
At 45 years of age, Italy is a six-year-old bird that has achieved such results in the wings of a bird.
He has joined Seram Gordon Richardsam, Doug Smith, Lester Pigotam, Pitt Ederi, and William Carson.
The three-time champion of Detori, who had previously won the Ghyyar race, said, "That's something special."
I'm very upset because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big deal, it's not the Royal Askota, but it's the usual Friday night with 20,000 people.
I would feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predlection are expected with wings and heads.
Two joggs have achieved this record in contacts with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the final 20-year-old champion Sers Antony Mackoys, who installed several records in his career to win more than 4300 victories.
Lester Pigots, a nine-time winning winner, won 4493 in careers.
France is one of the best branches today, and there is no doubt that he has seen the results that he has only rarely been able to achieve.
He's strong and strong, but his tactics make him feel different from other rats.
He's a fantastic sports representative, his enthusiasm and his passion for the years joins fans in this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie that he had already won 6000 victories if he didn't share only the weekends and the big ones.
But speaking seriously, it is a real joy that France has been winning the United Kingdom talks regularly for 30 years.
He is a wise man who takes great advantage of British proverbs, and he is an excellent speaker.
Frank Detori pointed out this achievement with his company's brand - a flight resolver.
From the wind of the end, from the speed of flight to the final decision, Francnie Detori has been a bright face for 20 years.
This has been a full-fledged journey.
He has won an unprecedented number of talks, including a famous 1996 "Great Seventeenth" in Askot, and has also survived the plane crash and the disqualification of the use of the equipment.
Three years ago he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character by drawing those who doubted him back in his best form.
And he could have participated in the talks for a while - Detori said earlier that he would welcome further participation in the talks for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putins withdrew from the administration's director Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly dismissed Sergey Ivanov, head of the administration.
Ivanov has spent many years in the area of the closest people to Putin.
Today, 63 years old policy has been appointed as a special representative on matters of nature and transport.
The Kremlin Communication states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the director of the administration of the Russian Presidency" without giving rise to reasons.
In Ivanova’s place of residence, Anton Vaino, who has been his guest since 2012.
44-year-old Vaino has won a diploma.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious International Relations Institute of the State of Moscow (MVSAI) and later worked in the history of Tokyo.
As a letter to the Kremlin House, he later conducted the President's Protocol and the management of government staff.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your faith."
I believe that the main work of the administration is to support your work at the level of the President of the State by developing laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
On Friday, a Russian railway company was told that Ivanov himself wanted to move away and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Are you kidding me?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is a sound and close friend of Vladimir Putina and, like Putin, has been working at the Security Service of the Council.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a television session in the country, two men announced that Ivanov would withdraw from the mission on his own initiative.
However, despite the noise caused by the cameras, such an explanation is rarely confirmed, especially before Parliament's elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
No one knows.
However, the official statement is that the man who was considered a potential president immediately wanted to become the leader of the Russian environmental policy, is surrounded by a great deal of suspicion.
In the comments published on the Kremlin website, Ivanovs said to Putin: "This is the fact that in early 2012 I asked you to trust this complicated topic, which could even say, a problemal affair, four years.
It seems that I have been working on this project for four years and eight months.
In December 2011, Ivanov’s mission was launched.
Previously, he was a Prime Minister and a Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former U.S. State Security Service, as well as Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putins led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the VDK, and Ivanovs took over his site.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanovs was considered a potential candidate for the position of the Russian President, as Putin's conversion to the third term would be an anti-constitutional.
But then the president became another close companion of Putin's society - Dmitry Medvedevs.
Putin became the Prime Minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the President's office.
Fish in a beautiful town in Banfas
A man from Banfas asks for help to identify the conditions in which the species of fish have appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sweet juices that have left with a water stick .
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a video of fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone would know how these five centimetres of large fish came into his garden.
The cross-section of the winery: the pot is now connected to Faifu.
It is now planned to end the projects worth $1.35 billion in May 2017.
Engineers have joined the northern part of the Quinsferi crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing the end.
The construction of the Faifa tower and 600 metres of garage and over 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
At present, a project worth 1.35 billion marks is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brauns had been taken back to the building site today and was one of the first to hit the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historical moment in the construction of the port of Quinsferia."
In this project, we see an impossible engineering solution, where only more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel were used in the construction of this part.
Despite the heavy weight and size of the vessel, the association of the vessel and the transducer is an extremely delicate process, in which extensive precision is required.
In general, more than 79% of the roof has already been built and the last step that will be included in the bridge with Rositu today, which means that all parts of the roof are ready to be included.
"The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the construction of the highest class of engineering.
After the final stage of installation and its connection to the North Tower support, we have left the North Way phase with the ground part or transit.
This was done by waiting for 700 millimetres to the south of the north.
It was a very, very delicate operation at the same time.
It is delicious because the transport is 222 meters long, weighing about 6000 tonnes and had to be carried off by about 3 %.
Delicate because access to both directions with which the team was working was only a few millimetres.
Congratulations, everyone's done well.
Simona Baylsa is getting gold in the women's wine.
Aizmists judge.
Forget the rest.
Simon Bailsu doesn't stop it.
The dynamics.
Without effort, the wines will be filled on the balconies.
It's not possible on the floor.
It's completely harmless.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, 19 years old, the American Winner drew gold medals, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
Her total number of points 62,198 was overprivileged by the judge over the fate of the Serbian medal winner and her team member Alijas Raismanes and the result of the Russian athlete Alias Mustafin.
On Thursday, the US sportsman Simona Bailsa made a winery on the winery on the individual winery of the white sport for the final women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Riodezáneiro, Brazil.
Ballsa became the fourth American on a series that won a multi-winning champion title and a five-better Winner, to reduce the reputation of the best in her generation and possibly the best in the history of the Winners.
When the final result was announced, she ran out of gas because the long way to this point was over.
This achievement brings them closer to impossible sportsmen like Michael Felps, who has been watching his sport at another level.
Ballsa has dominated her sport for the last three years, with 15 medals in world champions, including 10 gold medals, performing such excellent, accurate and ambitious Winning combinations that in 1984 the Olympic champion Maria Lu Retone called her "the best Winner she's ever seen."
In Brazil he was facing a final test, where he had to cope with the hopes that were placed on him, not with other athletes.
She would be excited if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bailsa (on the left) and Alija Raismane were interviewed by the respective individuals in the 2016 Olympics in Riodezáneiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal Baals won the second day, making special election coordinator Marta Karolji's retreat ball.
Although Bailsa claims that in her long journey to the glory halls there has been no such thing, it is not true.
Part of her presentation was free of movement, including her special acrobatic transition, to introduce Latin music that would be very popular on the street near the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who adopted her parents when she was still a child and who discovered the trainer’s mother, Emija Burmese, on a trip to the sports hospital where the Burmese trainers had occurred has now become a force to be calculated.
She has not lost much of the competition since summer 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as she wants to.
Although Mustafin had little control during two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance sheet and free movement - part of the competition where Bails will defend his champion title, is still in front.
She appeared in the front with a result of 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened her leadership with a result in 15.933 free movement
Raismane looked at her smile as she looked forward to the results that were only formality and she shed tears of joy in her eyes when she was filled with the dream she had ever recorded in her notebook.
The result of Raisman was a small attraction for four years ago when he shared his third place with Mustafin, but he lost battle for bronze medals.
Now, 22 years old, the captain of a team called the American "old man", was appointed as a trusted leader.
After the delivery, she was free to leave for her doubts about her return, and she was able to put on an air - conditioned suit.
By the time she was 19 years old, Bailsa’s official Twitter entry r, which she had published this week, is now completely different.
Six-year-old Mahajs Brown's "sacraurmot" survived in Philadelphia.
The police report that a six-year-old boy believed to be in Philadelphia, stating that he was already the second six-year-old who was in Philadelphia this week.
The children’s parents confirmed the channel of CBS Philadelphia’s news that it was Mahays Brown.
The parents say that Brauns had been hit several times, including in the circus, in the leg, in the arm, and in the neck, but he was still at the funeral when he was taken to the hospital.
His mother, Delores, Mendeza, told television: "His little body was just broken."
I can't believe it.
The gender is critical in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family is informed that he will definitely return.
He had to start attending the first class of the local elementary school.
Brown is one of the four people who met in part of the town of Germanton.
Three men were also arrested: two 29 - year - olds and one 32 - year - olds.
Channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, but the other two are stable.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car in a critical situation that affected 29 years of age.
The other two were injured in the car, and the police searched whether any of them had been shot.
The investigator informed the channel CBS Philadelphia that several speakers were most likely involved in the crash.
In place of the event, weapons are found by the bosses, who belong to various weapons.
It looks like it's been a long time ago.
The two sides of the entrances are located on the sides of the hall.
"So it seems that there have been a number of armed fighters who were actively involved in rioting here," says Captain Antony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police.
The damage has also been caused by several homes and cars.
No one has yet been arrested and the police are reported checking the records of surveillance cameras.
On the second day of the quake, a six - year - old girl fell into a coma while riding in front of her house in the Western Hemisphere.
He's getting better, but the police are still looking for the enemy.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I called it the Year's Women's Olympic Vieglatlet for several reasons.
First, I have been on all summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, there are three lightweights, Simona Bailsa, Gabija Duglasa and Laurie Hernandeza, which are introduced to many young girls.
People can be pleased that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is Hebrew and Medison Kocia, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team is really representing America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years, the best winemaker has been an American of African origin.
Last year, Simon and Gaby took up positions 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the former Olympics, Gabija Duglas became an Olympic champion, and America was able to swim.
Now the world has seen incredible wineries performed by the three-fold world champions Simon Bailsa, Duglasa, and Laurie Hernándeza, doing amazing, but masterful wineries.
The fourth day Simona became a fourth American by order that had obtained gold medals in an individual number of women.
Her teammate, Alija Raismane, acquired a metal mine.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but the situation in the other country is completely different in winter hours.
Simona, Gabia, and Laurie came to the Olympics in the same way as Alya and Madison.
She's the "Olympical Witness" because the next Olympic Winning team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of trainer Marta Karolas.
The Winning really is a great sport. Winningers mainly train private lightball clubs, and maintain them with parents who pay for trains, rooms, travel, training courses, hotels (trainers, sportsmen and their families) and other expenses.
Most of this lighthouse club is located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
These club sportsmen call all their training, and this is a great and long investment for easy families.
Eimija Burwman - Simonas Bailsa trainer and Maggie Hainija - Laurija Hernandez trainer has trained their athletes since the two girls started working with a flexible.
We need to provide new girls with the opportunities to engage Simona, Gabia and Lauria, the most rewarding winning training.
I have built my lightweight organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish origins) winery training at no cost or at a low price. We have also trained national and international campaigns.
In September, we opened a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn about this great kind of sport.
It also taught the coordination of the forces, the location and the body, to work hard, discipline and progress towards the goal.
This combination ensures longevity with good health and success at school and at work.
In this team, thousands of young girls are trained in the lightlight, and this is fantastic.
Working with this kind of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabia and Medison for the great "Georgian Force" demonstration, getting Olympic games gold medals and encouraging new, diverse girls to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of the proposal by Jeremy Hanta, the young doctors plan to remove more strands.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on amendments to the Agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association, but they rejected 58 per cent of the 37 000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hants announced plans to conclude a contract indicating that NHS is in a state of instability and that further delays will only affect staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions on night shifts and weekends in order to improve working conditions during hours of work.
Last night, Dr. Elena Makourta, a new BMA doctor, announced that new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it deepens the labour crisis and does not provide for all doctors with equal conditions.
The remaining eight weeks until the first new doctor group will sign a new contract, so progress must be made, as the time has not yet been much.
The BMA's efforts to solve the problems in the way of negotiations have been met with the Government's refusal to participate and sometimes with a complete hearing.
This happened despite the fact that in the last month, Jeremy Hunts said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hantam needs to act immediately, stop unemployment and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not, the young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last quarter, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were left at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had been in the pike.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on amendments to the Agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to increase the rate of work per week for 54 000 new doctors concerned by the new contracts.
The NHS Executive Director, Daniel Mortimers, called on new doctors not to give a strike.
Mr Mortimer explained that the strike does not solve anything, but only increases pressure on the employees who are under pressure and causes stress and pain in patients, caregivers and their families.
For the past two months, we have talked to the new Committee of Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about sellers and reporters.
Workers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as job creation, flexible training, additional training for those who return after a break of career, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, drop in studies and gender pay in medicine - shows that employers, the English Institute for Health Education and the Ministry of Health want to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal product subject to 2 injections a day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients with heart disease may be treated with medicines for 2 injections a day, as official representatives recommend that they be used for more people and longer periods of time.
Ticagreur reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine has already been prescribed for use 12 months after heart attack, reducing the risk of repeated heart attack.
The NHS representative recommended that this medicinal product be used 4 years after breast-feeding in order to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with heart problems and blood vessels.
However, NHS recommends that this preparation be used for 4 years after breast-feeding to further reduce the risk of heart and blood clots.
About 140 000 people live in England each year, and a quarter of them experience repeated heart attacks or strokes.
Cardiovascular and insults cause inflammation of fat in the heart of the chest by forming congestion.
If it is spread, it can cause thrombosis by blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing heart attack.
On the other hand, if the thromboembolism departs from the blood vessels, it can develop into a blood clot and block the blood access to the brain by causing an infarction.
People who have had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca, a British company and marketed by Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that humans take 90 mg Ticagrel for 12 months and for another 3 years 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology, Professor Carol Longson, explains: "Despite the availability of remedied medications to prevent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke that often has serious consequences."
Biles from repeated heart attacks can leave a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrel in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of repeated cardiac and infarction in humans who have already experienced it.
By temporarily administering Ticagrelor, we are happy to be able to expand the treatment opportunities for thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrel, in particular the risk of bleeding, using this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that they be used longer than this deadline.
The culture of policy correction promotes corruption in Muslim communities during the election
According to the management report, the former mayor of the city of Tuerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahmans, was removed from the scene of corruption.
The government report reveals that as a result of the culture of the policy correction, eyes are focused on widespread corruption in the Muslim communities.
Former Minister of Government Sers Erik Pikls criticizes police, electoral authorities and urban councils that they ignore the signs of error in the election process, because "they are afraid to deny ethnic and religious interests."
The former Community Secretary, who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the arrest of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to put their jobs at the electoral stations to protect the elected voters.
He also recommends that voters should be shown a document proving persons when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
Only name and address must now be given to the voters.
He even recommends marking the purchases of voting voters with a special tin to prevent double voting.
The rapporteurs must also provide greater protection, says Sir Erik.
He believes that the press should have greater access to the Council's documents and decisions adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He says, "The goal is not only to prevent corruption from the choice of the option but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and corruption culture that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was sent by Daungstritt following a scandal in connection with the elections in the city of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Court of Justice decided to remove the measure of the city of Lutfur Rahman from the city due to corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "skinically confused" his Muslim community's religious views and listened to his criticisms, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign with the guidance that the religious duty of faithful Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 voices were false or suspicious, for one person had spoken several times.
In addition, Sers Eriks points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that there was a particularly disturbing error in voting by mail, where the older members of the Muslim community forced others to vote for their desired candidates.
Sers Eriks recommended a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document proving persons to clarify the identity of the person.
His report writes: "The evidence shows that members of the non-protected ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the older elected candidates of the community, in particular in the Bangladesh and Pakistan communities."
"There is a concern that the institutions in the area do not pay attention to these problems because of the policy corrections, as they could eliminate ethnic and religious interests."
Sers Eriks made 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also prohibits political activists from working with votes taken by mail in order to prevent "voting".
The report of Tereza Meja also called for a more careful registration check to prevent the use of electoral lists for infringements in the area of immigration and aid.
Consider the possibility before voting to ask voters to display a document of proof of persons.
Mark voting voters' tickets with a special ink to prevent double voting.
A systematic examination of the nationality of persons in order to ensure that a person has the right to vote.
Set the three-year limit for requests for automatic voting by mail.
To prohibit political campaigns and activists from working with votes sent by mail and election to polls by mail.
To provide the police with the power to guard against the polling intruders.
Amendments to the Law in order to facilitate the recruitment of persons under the Human Rights Act of 1983.
Stop taking a photo of the selection in the screenshots.
Set the selection requirement in the cells to use only English (except Velsa).
To strengthen training to ensure that the electors go to the polling booths one by one.
Sir Erik's ass criticizes the Metropole police, saying that no charges have been raised in Tauerhamlet case .
He says: "The election of the court has only discriminated against Luftru Rahmana and his representatives on the activities related to corruption and corruption."
He was clearly recognized as guilty by the standard of criminal evidence on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the "examination" of electors in the register of electors in the city council.
Sers Eraks notes: "The decision taken last year is a call for fear.
Our country is known as the family of Parliament, but the spread of corruption and the fact that corruption does not threaten this good reputation is a disturbing and hidden choice.

In 2016, the fans of the Rio Olympics felt like the French knight of Paulina Ferrando Prevota, who recognized them as extremely similar to the Cambridge Hercogiene.

CBC Olympic Games Commentant laments its comment that the Chinese fan will be 'end as a dog'.
The 14-year-old Bairona Macdonalda analysis in the 4x200 m free-style stapheth of Ai Yanhas in the 4x200 m finish place, called the compatriot wind in the CBC viewers.
The Canal of Canada was proud to resign because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese fan of competition was "dried out of the competitions that he had just died" and "would end up like a dog".
Commentary Bairons McDonalds thought his microphone was off when 4x200 m free-style staff women finally showed their personal views .
McDonald, who was included in the CBC's team to give comments on life, said: "The little fourteen-year-old Chinese is unable to stay with him."
"After she got up, she ran away from the competitions that she just died and ended up like a dog."
Thank you very much.
At 14 years of age, the Chinese poet Ai Yanhana's result at the second stage was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds earlier than Canadian Taylor Ruck's result, allowing Canadians to reach China.
The readers throughout Canada responded immediately to the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emets Makfarlais wrote on Twitter: "Are you the direct CBC commentator just saying that 14-year-old contender from China "has finished like a dog"???".
The idiot did not realize that they were still in the straight line.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free style for final women was called "a mass forty-year-old from China who is not with her."
The criticism against the Bairos Macdonald was quickly adopted, as many asked for clarifications.
Twitter users were unable to believe the unfavourable comments of Bairona Macdonalda.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You're a representative of CBC and Canada and Tevis. We're all listening as racists.
Skots Rasel, who was then directly head of the CBC, complained about the comments of McDonald, saying: "We regret that the comment on the outcome of the polling came back in the immediate stage."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words, and we are very sorry that this happened.
The CBC recalled more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
McDonald's colleagues Scott Russell came to his place.
Then CBC included more than 90 Twitter users who complained about Makdonalda’s comments.
The channel also quickly published feedback and notification.
We are very sorry that such comments were made and they went straight to the stage.
In the evening, we responded immediately and welcomed all viewers and followers of social media.
It should be clear that Bairona’s comments were made about the donor’s gift, not addressed to him personally.
However, in any case, they were not professional and failed to choose words and Baron was very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally withdrew to the immediate court and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be taken as a personal assault.
CBC Olympic Games he said directly: "I would like to use the time and regret the comment I made last night after the women's free-style competitions."
I've been talking about the donor's gift, not about him personally.
I'm sorry to say that I didn't mean to show up, and I'm really sorry about what happened.
Premarked buyers were shocked by a woman who suddenly appeared in the middle of the subcontractor's business.
The first feeling was not good when the woman started to dress up to act in the middle of her pregnancy.
As the situation deteriorated, she approached them to make sure that they belonged to her and then moved back to the shop.
She continued to search for clothing at the center of the Volkestone Bouverie Place trade and attended four more biscuits.
Primark will operate at Bouverie Place Trade Center in Folkeston – a place where this woman attended the basement and then dropped it back into the floor.
At the same time, two children were found in the shop, Jeannie Davidson’s mother, who tells us that a woman who was not known after the afternoon meal took off her clothes and did not steal anything.
He said that humans were unable to look at themselves.
In the middle of the shop, she took her shoes off the floor, covered her pockets and pockets, and put them on the floor.
She did not even try to find a more discrepancy place where they were to be measured, and she simply stuck it to the place.
Everyone looked at her face and apparently didn't like her, because she just dropped her back in the throat.
She weighed more than three pounds [2 kg], until she decided that none of them liked her and took off her business.
They did not seem to be able to stop them from seeing or thinking about a person who would buy the clothes they were wearing.
Miss Davidson, 33 years old, from Kent, says: "It's a good idea that someone buys the clothes that someone else has caught and that's not removed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson adds: "I accept that after her departure, business workers have removed these clothes from the shop doors - which are also acceptable."
I can't imagine that I could buy a new subpoena and know that the other women have taken it and then they have not been removed.
The representative of the Primark indicated that Primark was known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Specific clothing is removed from the hair of the trader.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves from the firefighters nearby, we spoke with Krav Maga Mayor from Ronu Mirraki, New York.
Regardless of whether you're missing from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get over the shot.
It is clear that if an intruder is missing from the door, first of all it is necessary to make sure that the attacker is clearly visible and avoids this trajectory.
Then the armed man shall stand between his right hand and his left, and shall set his face against the enemy by his own free course.
Then follow a line through the circle, and until the attacker is in pain, he must be taken with the weapon, put on his face with the sword and retreat, and continue turning his weapons against him.
If the shooter is coming from the front, the situation is similar - to avoid this trajectory, keep the gun and put it away so that the thief can't escape.
At the same time, pressure must be placed on the weapon and force the opponent to carry the weapon through the chest and finally take the weapon and withdraw from it by continuing to rely on it.
Did you hear the trouble?
See the video to see exactly how Mirraki does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, it's safer to give the hunter your money.
The family of the water was destroyed by the Saltaša Kornvol's social home and is placed on the street.
The water family has been expelled from the neighborhood for the terrorism of its neighbours, causing damage to the social home of 50,000 children.
Tanja Skeldon and his partner, Shoon Trebilkoks, were expelled from the property in Saltaša Kornvola, as several complaints were filed against them.
When they were forced to leave their property, the shocked household service representatives found that the property was completely destroyed.
The walls and walls were filled with ruins, all of them covered with ruins, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now free of property and most likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, managing director of the Cornvol Home Service, says there is concern that the house will not be restored.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and that she felt that it was impossible for people to live.
In this case, several factors need to be assessed, as there will be no good reputation for this property in Kornvol.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
There have been three reasons that have been sustained on a regular basis, and the police say that their terror has been expressed as violence, excavating the streets with baseball bats, kidnapping of local people, drug use, drug trafficking and mass abuse and relaxation.
47 years old Skeldon, whose name was the property, will be sentenced to an antisocial act in June.
A number of destroyed houses have been found in ruins.
There are also several reasons why drugs are being marketed at home.
The families say they regularly walked on the street and remained in what was called the police.
The Kornvola Home Service provided them with the strength of the property when they were given 11 weeks to get out of the house in a voluntary way.
The missing neighbors were very happy to leave because their lives were absolute.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived with them for about 20 years, which has always been a tragedy.
I'm not sure how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't keep going.
We're going to show up because there was such a noise here - we haven't experienced it!
Now that they're finally prom, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatik, head of the Cornvol Home Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and regularly called the police here.
In the growing garden of the house, various old and unusable items were found.
He also said: "I am very sorry that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their conduct, since leaving the house is always the last step discussed by the Cornvol Home Service."
This was a very difficult case because their conduct was extreme and their neighbors were very strict in their conduct.
I have assessed the work that all my team, Devona and Kornvol police and community members have invested in in this case, who were courageous and cooperated with us by providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will ease the lives of the neighbors and show that antisocial behaviour is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three children lived here for a different period of time, but all were about 20 years old.
Non-clean matrices left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying down.
Service personnel will now have to clean up the waste waste that is left at home.
In 2014, the police took over 70 grams of marijuana, weights, assets and 1700 coins in clear money.
Skeldone is only recognised as harmful to the storage of drug substances in Class B with a view to distributing them.
She concluded that money was intended to be remembered by her son, Lí Šeldon, who suffered in a car accident in 2013.
After leaving we know that they are now renting a private property in Plimu.
Many of the walls of the house were marked by graphics.
The police have reported that they will continue to hire fugitives who violate their rent contracts.
The representative of Devona and Kornvola police, Angela Krova, points out that this settlement is an undisclosed warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
He also said, "This is a warning to those who think they can take it as they want, and there will be no consequences for it."
Devona and Cronvola police do not accept criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect the local communities.
The readiness to spend can contribute to the economy.

The canals are forbidden from the burgins in the lungs.
The French city of Cannas, in the south-eastern part of France, has been banned by the use of plastics in this city’s lungs, which are almost completely blocked by the woman’s body and greatly reminiscent of the hydrotrate, the local officials reported on Thursday.
The Candace scale David Linnars has signed an order that "access to the beaches and to the beach is prohibited for everyone who has no footstep that respects good habits and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmal rate, which is an exceptional expression of religious ownership when France and the places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create a risk of public disturbance (drugs, fraud, etc.), which is necessary to prevent," said the action.
"We are not talking about a religious ban on the sale of symbols in the platform, but about an extraordinary clothing that is linked to the confidence in the movements of terrorists who fight against us," explained the head of the municipal service director, Thierry Miguel.
He adds that the Burkini peldkosts in Kannu’s beaches have not been seen since 28 July, when the best members of the Central Party's "Republicans" members signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the aquapark in the city of Marseille has abandoned private measures for Muslim women who would be dressed in linens, as the consensus on such a measure has been expressed both for the good and for the political of the church.

On 14 July, Kanna was killed by 85 people by the armed terrorist group "Islam State" in the nearby city of Nicosia.
On July 26th, two attackers, who had defeated the belief in the Islamic State, were brutally excommunicated by the priests at the synagogue in northern France.

The festival "Cubana" began in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, 11 August, the evening in Lucavsala was given a start at one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be a "Cubana" until Sunday night.
During the first night, groups such as Enter Shikari were held from Britain, which were expected last night, but the program did not show up, American banks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the "The Prodigy" group and others.
Also in the next days of the festival program are respectful words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", pancroke legend "Ramones" founder Markijs Ramons with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the leader of the Baltkriev pancroke in the front of Sergey Mihaluk, a popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full event program can be discussed here.
This is the second year when the "Cubana" festival takes place in Latvia.
After it suffered financial failure and serious losses, but it did not stop the perpetrators from re-examination - they added the name to the name, included a group of Latvians (on Friday night 19:15 on the "All Day Long" show) and announced that the festival was now "stirred and won the local color alongside Riga symbols such as its pants and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, yet still to be judged, because the festival just collapsed, but as the first night observed the "Delfi Explosion", at least in the past many people's efforts to admit did not come out and the number of visitors was similar.
The British treading team has twice won a good Olympic record and won the press.

President, who remained in the chamber: Gustava Zemgala - 145.
Friday, 12 August, about 145 years since the birth of the second president of Latvia, Gustav Zemgal.
Zemgal announced the state of Latvia, but unfortunately there is still a wide-ranging description of the first president of Latvia, Jan Chakste, and the last part of the period of President Karl Ulman.
None of our citizens have been so much protected by democracy and justice as Zemgal, a book written ten years ago in Gustav Zemgala.
In a conversation with the Portal "Delfi" Auzünš points out that Zemgal is one of the rare high-level politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of them are strong, always very right.
He taught it not to be, it could be the same today as that of Raymond Vínnis.
"He was the one who was close to the people," says Auzion.
Today's politicians know bad stories, they refer to Karl Ulman as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how bad he was.
The only person on the board who was not a thief was General Balodis.
Even if he was tall and thin in appearance, he was historical.
"Zemgal with its sense of humor and democracy leaves a direct negative impact," Auzionš said.
Professor of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia in consultation with "Delfi" to agree with the Auzins' assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and respected citizen.
He also notes that Zemgals has given respect to minorities and has regularly called upon the representatives of the Hebrews to take the lead.
"At that time it was not an act of terror, after the German Presidency Alberts Kviess took over this tradition," the historian told.
He was a deaf man who had long come to speak as a president.
He didn't say it himself. He just didn't sing.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know the French language but felt that the President must understand it.
"In the course of the Presidency, the principles of French language were taught," Stranga explained.
The ground did not allow him to be summoned again, it really did not like him very much.
In all things, he is a very valuable person in the history of Latvia, already in the House of Presidents before his arrival - he was very demanding.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgal Kisi Suvorova village 3, where a company of rich and wealthy people was located, where the government was engaged in practical negotiations between the state of Latvia.
He was always progressive.
There was not a great Ulman treasurer, but he was not publicly opposed.
"In private conversations, it has often been said that Ulman's actions do not empathize with him," says Stranga.
He lived a peaceful life, no idea of lawlessness or corruption.
How does Zemgal remember today?
I'm sorry, but most of the time, he was only associated with some part of Riga.
He was an absolute democracy, considered central.
"There were no major disturbances in his time, that is, he could have associated with it with the real stable presidency," says Strange.
During the presidency of Gustava Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, a visit of the Latvian state to Sweden, which was then directly meant to Latvia by full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the northern European democratic nation.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgal visited the country in Stockholm.
The visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but he died in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child end up with a deep breath.
I have often come to face the fact that the child’s breathing, the presence of the nose, is perceived by the parents as something that is wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly shows his breath - we don't know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologically Jekaterin Kesa.
The specialist is encouraging a small debate on these natural and human emotions - the thoughts and feelings that each of us is experiencing on a regular basis.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity that is addressed to other people, and it usually occurs when we feel sad.
As we grow older, we are sensitive, confused - we usually know what is happening to us and how to end it.
We can say, push, hide, keep ourselves, tell our friends or other neighbors, we can dream of breaking the pipe, smell cigarettes (this is not the best way to cry the shower!), go into the shower, go to the kitchen on the table and do other things that are usually not done.
We do not oppose our aggression against others because we know different ways to end up with these emotions.
Children do not understand what is going on with them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Ei prom!", you're dumb, "Mama," "I don't mind you," "I'm with you without fear," and very rarely when I can say, "I'm on you in the mood."
Children live in a literal sense, they are all right here, this time, they are spontaneous and really express their feelings, and often they are different emotions in the mood.
It is very important that parents do not prevent their children from expressing their feelings, including feelings, without complaining about them and the nerves, but rather, directly, help the child.
Do you need to be careful about the relationship?
The last working day in which all the windows didn't want what you wanted, or just the bad smell - there are so many reasons why you would like to be late, day or even longer to "close" from all over the world.
Is it possible to have relationships and a small amount of uzelpot?
Does this mean, though, that each one of the partners is on his or her own way?
In his opinion, the king was involved in various ages.
Janis (23) is short and noble: "In my view, if you need a relationship, you are not with a real person".
Before long, Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that may help.
If you feel that your partner is starting to blame you for every smaller cause, then definitely - it is a real time when you should study other fields of medicine to understand whether you are missing, or especially because you do not think or even want to see them again.
So the answer is - yes, keeping busy can help save time and understand how important you are on the other side.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, relations should be taken apart from each other every day, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the conflict is inevitable.
This results in the formation of each of the other’s cells, and it begins to pass on to the nerves.
People start touching each other, especially if there is no more to talk about, just about what you have done every day.
My personal experience makes me think about it, so I haven't had relations for more than a few months.
If you ever think that others or others are better - then why has this woman with whom you are together been blessed by someone who may think that you are not good enough and that behind the mountains there are paradise areas?
It's just a little bit of a coincidence.
If not, then not.
"I am, therefore, not many of those who are not." said Edmunds (46).
Karlim (33) is a completely hostile opinion.
I'm hoping everyone needs some time off.
You can't see every dream, all the time, from morning till evening, in the eyes of each other and lie about unfathomable love.
Attopis!
There's so many things - friends, jobs, balls.
It's all your time.
Of course, even a close friend or a wife, but if both are willing to maintain a balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live up to the cost of living.
That's it and that's it.
The husband (27) says: "It's hard to say - whether you need or not, you can or can't take the same, but one is clear - it's the one who's proposing something that's not in the end, something that's missing."
If this question arises, it should be calculated that in the near future there will be a change - to the good or to the bad side, it will depend on itself.
I think as long as you're new and new, you're so busy - something all the time, but when everything's going to be serious and relationships are going to be completely different, then there can't be any conversation about rest.
But you're going to decide all ours to eat together!
"If you can't hold on to another society now and once you need a room, then what will be when you'll be retired, who comment, how exciting cats or fights about what they should do better every day," explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the gentlemen have been changed.

Collegiate resigns from the application to the VID director's office.
The Director-General of the State Environment Service Inga Koljegova decided to withdraw its candidate to the title of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the Agency informed the Ministry of Finance.
The collegiate states that its discussion of the candidate has increased between the opposing coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the debate are linked to the political realities, but more often, the unseen interests and they are not talking to me about assessing my professional abilities.
"And this is not acceptable to me," points out already the head of the VID.
In the event that its candidate would be approved by the Government, it would be clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow it to work fully and implement the necessary changes to the VID, with all the support of the Government.
Without it, it would not be possible to pursue the work of Collegiate.
"I have publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically independent, but now all my candidate process is too political," the official said.
"Thanks for my confidence and support, it is an experience that I appreciate as a result," said the writer of Reizniece-Ozoli.

Riga's freedom has introduced all VK's recommendations on the Russian island project.
The Riga Freedom Management has introduced all of the five National Control (WC) recommendations on the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities in the Russian island of Russia from the city centre, the Portal Dina.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project shall be planned at the next meeting of the Council of the Republic of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the requirements of the VK, the Rīga Freedoms Management Board also conducted the results of the legal and operational audit carried out by the International Auditor Deloitte Riga Freedom Management Board and the recommendations made to improve the management of the project in the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations is also sent to the VK today.
Despite the fact that Riga's voluntary administration does not agree with the opinion prepared by the VK on the effectiveness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the planned construction work within the project is complete within the time-limits and the planned amount.
"To prove to all involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the VK and the drivers, that the main objective of the voluntary project is to succeed, we have fully introduced all the VK recommendations on project management and monitoring," said Sanita Kaier, director of the Russian island project.
The long-term plan for monitoring and monitoring the project was complemented by the most important planned actions of the parties involved and the necessary deadlines, the definitions of meetings and regular reference and their deadlines, the planned construction process monitoring instruments, and the most important thresholds.
The approved action plan for achieving the project’s objective by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the VC, was complemented by the implementation monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the control of the duration of the actions of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Republic of Riga.
A project management plan has been developed for the development of project management and for the reduction of potential risks, by defining project management areas and by specifying the documents drawn up to ensure control and monitoring mechanisms for each of them.
In order to increase project capacity, a project management structure has been developed which reflects the structure, qualifications and functions of the planned project management team.
In order to improve the communication between the parties involved in the project, the communication plan of interested parties, in addition to the Parties identified in the project action plan, sets out the principles, types and periodicity of the project for the successful completion of the project.
In order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion or opening of a service contract will continue to be more detailed and legal.
Within the project, the Russian island has built a port infrastructure corresponding to global standards - four new deep-sea facilities, railways, and engineering communications.
The co-financed buildings of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the year already opened, with the amount of EUR 10.6 million allocated to it.

The German researchers are discussing the number of "Berlin's Death".
According to a new study, the number of injured by the communists in the south could be much larger than the previously considered, but the doubts about the number of true victims still remain undisclosed.
According to data provided by the Berlin Museum of Checkpoint Charlie on Wednesday, between 1945 and 1989, at the border with the east-west areas, and the Westminster Communists' power station was closed to 1841 people who were trying to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and is constantly improving the number of murders.
This year 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including involving the victims of a six-year-old son who died, attempting to enter the family in Western Russia through the eastern Czech Republic and Hungary.
Among the new Berlin Uurpurs are also the deserters of the Soviet army.
"The final amount of damage caused by the double injury to communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," acknowledged museum director Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to get the lives of those who are in harm's way, trying to avoid the Communists-controlled state, to be collected and ignored," stressed in a report published by Hildebrandt.
However, other researchers have already doubted the new figures.
"Skaitlis 1841 is incredible," said Professor Johns Stattt, an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.
He, together with other researchers at the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing possible fatalities at the border and has been able to confirm only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers have said that only 138 people have been buried in Berlin by the communists.
In view of the people who have suffered, trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to enter the Middle East through the territory of neighboring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this is much less than 1841 at the same time.
One of the reasons for the different number of birds could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all cases of suicide in the Austrian border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not related to direct activity.
"If older people from 70 to 80 years of age have experienced border controls from the heart, then there must be the consequences of these "sleptic boundaries", Hildebrandt is considered.
However, the State is convinced that a difference should be made between the elderly, who may have died as a result of their experience, and those who have died from a long waiting period in the bus on the border.
Regardless of its reputation, it is not easy to record, as the authorities of the Communist Austrouvian Power have not disclosed such statistical data, and researchers have to delete documents in different destroyed archives, states the State.
However, the new documents have recently been received by the State party, and therefore it could arrive in the near future with a new figure.
LPF President Pone to Rio owes trainer accreditation; this is a surprise.
In recent days, President Kaspars Pone Riodezáneiro, who won the leading praise of the Latvian Federation of Pledgings (LPF), came to the Olympic Games with a trainer's accreditation, but he felt surprised about it.
On the third day, a large number of asylum seekers followed the words of trainer Allonas Ribakovas of the Olympics trainer Germana Jakubovska, who discovered that the last time the trainer decided to go to Riodezáneiro, he had to stay at home.
The initial list of passengers was approved by Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, trainers Jakubovski and Davis Kolins, as well as the federation president Pone.
The Latvian Federation of Peding for Olympic Games asked five participants, and even before the departure, Aldon Vrublaevskis claimed that Germans would be and are looking for tickets.
"However, for obvious reasons, he was not," said Pone, expressing the view that this did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvja trainer agreed to help her.
Mr, who is a member of the LOK Executive Committee, but criticised the operation of the LOK by putting the blame on the Olympic Sports Supervisory Organisation.
In my view, it is unrealistic to approve five persons in the LOK Executive Committee and not withdraw any of them.
"I don't know why the Federation didn't get enough seats," Mr. Ponie said that the work of the federations and their presidents had not been evaluated in the public, remembering that the federation presidents did not receive wages.
Pone also criticized Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he filed a complaint at the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any sportsmen.
Mr. even couldn't tell why he was in the Olympics with a trainer's accreditation, which probably had to reach Jakubovski.
"I was appointed as the President of the Federation ("the team leader"), but for some unknown reason I received training accreditation and now I am not fit in."
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditations changed.
Recently, I thought that Germans would be there because I had no other information.
After the information in the LETA agency, a few days before Ribakova started, she had a conversation here with Poni and after her pilot had been in tears, but even the LPF president said it had been a daily conversation with a desire to stop sportsmen before the start.
He recalled that the LPF was monitoring five types of sport in the Olympic programme and that four of them also take place for training children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that there are also very important cross-border issues in Latvia, as well as such programmes, that Riodezáneiro has been present for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in Latvia in 2018, the World Cup could be resolved.
The presence of Riodezáneiro is not my leave, here I am working, spending my time and trying to implement the four-year programmes.
In most cases, 600,000 small fish will be caught.
AS Latvenergo Fishing Resources Renewables Program This week in Daugau to Mangalsalas is scheduled to rent more than 600,000 single-year-old salmon and time-old fish grown in the Bior Tomes and Doles fishing institutes.

This year, Daugavas will host more than 600,000 equal to or less than a year.
For the second year prior to entry, small fish fish are already marked with a fatty acid.
Today, there are 25,000 lichens with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, scientificly based species and digitally in Daugau and its base water styles are involved in fishing for small and medium-sized fish.
The development of fishing resources in Daugau and its base water styles shall be carried out by the Office on the basis of a study of the losses incurred by the Latvian economic activity and a conclusion on the measures to be taken to ensure the diversity of fishing resources.
On the other hand, the State Environment Service shall, on the basis of that expertise, decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of Latvian compensation for fishing resources is EUR 1,035,000 in the programme.
In the spring of 2016, Latvia, in cooperation with the company "We fish", will be located in the fifth year of 400 artificial fish lakes in Daugau to Kabila and Ikköile.
Cooperation with the company in favour of the nature of the fishing industry is an additional support under the initiative for the refurbishment of fisheries resources programme.
The establishment of artificial lakes in the watershed is an important step that contributes to the protection and development of fish resources in Dauga.

The French court rejected the request of the Kale authorities to hire ten self-made shops and restaurants in the village of Jungl, where thousands of refugees live.
This week at the trial meeting in Kale, the authorities indicated that the country should hire 72 self-designed shops where people in the territory of destination market different goods, such as cigarettes and energy, offer free-services, 50 cents (40p) and simple furniture for some euro-based restaurants.
The prefecture office pointed out that these self-designed companies must be satisfied because they create the economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small companies are important because the food provided by the government and support groups does not provide housing needs where the number of victims continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-designed shops and restaurants often offer free meals and food for those who need it most.
The Court of Justice ruled that it was not a legal basis to express concern about people who have created 72 self-made factories, but it understood the concerns of Kale Prefect.
Justice Jans-France Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "very uncanny conditions".

On Friday, the two charity organisations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of refugees in the ‘Jungle’ refugee camp has increased to 9000 people, which is the highest figure since the rapid arrival of migrants in the summer.
Britain receives a silver regbium-7 series in battle when Fiji's state unit is heavily oiled.
The impressive performance of the British election in Regbija-7 series ended on Thursday, when the overwhelming finale at the "Deodoro" stadium in Rio Fiji convinced them of the outcome of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated the master class in the management of the bombs, the bombs played with the legs, the support game and the brutal power game, killing gold - the first Olympic medal in its history of existence.
The story brought valuable relief - a silver medal that was now the third medal in Britain. The British edition can be pleased with its success in the first Olympic regbija-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the hard fight, in which Boks team insists on the results of 7:5 days on the first side, it is possible to play the British final.
But in any case, Fiji is now in its best form to win 15 men's command.
Although we cannot believe it, we know the peace of the UK could be the fact that at least one Briton gained gold medal. It is Fiji's main coach Bens Raiens - former English coach from Vimbdona.
This was an exciting experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Rayna's leadership, they lost all the games in Regbija-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
It is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji has been an impressive start in the process of opening the steps of the British forces after.
Captain Tom Michel and the members of the board were in contact with several anti-road buses and the World Series campaign was conducted with 5:0 when Osea Colinsau won the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwa has also increased the pressure to achieve a fall in the right direction.
The result 12:0 and the British team did not even really hit the bomb.
Michela’s great power did not allow natural Leon Nakarava to get three points, but it only had a little impact on Fiji’s outcome.
The games in the seventh minute Jasa Veremallu won a fall in a good score, strengthening the cross over Britain to 17:0.
After the rehearsal, Nakarava increased the excess and until the end it remained more than a minute... to the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravovov avoided some of the ineffective British methods and crossed the line, finding points.
The floor provided a result 29:0.
It's like Fiji's born to play Regbie-7 games while the British are still learning.
Actually, it's also true.
The British team made fundamental changes in half the time by crossing the Fiji player line... full four minutes after the first half of the standards were good, until Joshua Tusova, after the fantastic team's games, received some more points in the Fiji team's good.
Dana Norton was able to get points in the British team's good, making a fall in the circle and achieving the result 36:7, but the game was already lost, so much the South Sea trekker fan sounded, drew the carts and went into the tribine.
Fiji’s lifestyle attitude cannot be overemphasized.
Mata Viliame made Fiji win even more sweeter at the end of the game.
By the end of the game, Fiji was able to start singing, but the British, after all, was able to sit in the medicine.
On the first half of the day, Fiji won Japan as a result of 20:5, while the British were far over South Africa, where in a very severe battle both teams won by landing and the South Africans lost only a few points.
The first half of Kails Brauns formed the Box Command, but the second half of the Danish Nortons crossed the line with sharp skill and acquired a bomb between the pillars, providing British victory.
Markus Vatson, who is the brother of Antonia at the end of the game, was the winner of the team and another material medal at the end of the game.
The trainer's battle with cancer inspired Helen Gloveri and Heter Staningu to win the air race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these sentences, and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last century, Hellenas Gloveres and Heteres Staningas gold mill had a special role in the Stacio da Lagoa trail.
Although there are only two sportsmen on board, she received the support of Robin Viljams, who encouraged her until the second Olympic gold medal to win over women, becoming the first women in the history of British sports that had such success.
She was no doubt overwhelmed by the fact that 39 times she had won an unexplained, unexplained victory.
Both large sportsmen with a deep elegance swimming on the surface of water do not fully reflect this triumph.
After each of the gold medals received, a team of the whole team is working hard to keep sportsmen on improving their performance and making the biggest contribution to their success, a trainer who had not yet known 30 months ago, or would survive this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
After he said, it seemed as quickly as they could.
I had an uric acid, which is one of the things that can operate, and that's what happened.
If I don't, it'll be distributed throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It doesn't change your vision a little bit.
In December 2013, the visas were opened in Viljamsa.
In this three way, Viljam was able to initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of 2014 and to reduce the duration of the suspension to a minimum if it can be said.
I needed income, so I had to get back quickly.
It encouraged recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I got 6, 10 and even 15 feet [15 m] of gas, even though the doctor said he would agree with some paths.
It all started.
Airlifting itself is a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thought was about William, who was very upset all morning and spoke more than usual.
Staninga, who was born in the Royal Artillery unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was a very emotional week, but it means a lot to me."
This only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years with Helen and Robinson have been great.
Without Robin, we would have achieved nothing, so thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better training team or a better coach.
Helen Glovere and Heter Staninga have not lost any of their names in five years.
The transition results in such a rapid pace that competitors cannot cope with.
Even in the last 500 feet [500 m] when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to arrive, Staningas and Gloveres were too large.
We feel every dream.
Helena cried, "Keep the rhythm, stay the rhythm."
Not losing concentration is really important.
We had a good start, but at the same time, we did not have high hopes.
That day, we did not intend to burn records, but we just had to breathe well and win the fight, and we did the same.
After a few years, you will be relieved to decide what to do next.
The next month, Glover's and television liver will be the founder of Steve Bashal.
In the meantime, she just wants to enjoy the smell.
I didn't mean to say that these were my last adventures.
This would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very impressed.
About four minutes were needed this time.
She said, "It's amazing."

Collegiate VID's lead theme "will go to the last".
As he said, now Minister Márim Kučinskim (Green and Green Union) and Finance Minister Danai Reizniecei-Ozolai (Green and Green Union) are already "primarily important" to approve the financial candidate led by the Minister for Finance of the VID's Office.
Rajevski says that both Kučinski and Reizniec-Ozolai in this government are "the first major decision" that can affect them as a political future.
If you now start to change the position of the VID director on the election of the candidate, it will have a negative impact on the governance of their home country of immunisation.
The next week's session of the Cabinet is included in the agenda of the meeting of the Director-General of the VID, showing the government's working schedule.
Mr Reizniece-Ozola, Director-General of the College of VID, took the lead in the task of managing the service after the withdrawal of Inára Petererson and when the competition with the Director-General of the VID ended with no results.
On Thursday, 11 August, the Director of the VID performed his duties at Dace Pelek on the fourth day of the interview in Latvia Radio - if he offered to apply to the board of directors, he could agree.
The Minister of Finance later acknowledged that there were no candidates for other VID managers in the past.
In addition, the Head of the National Union Group of the Union, Raives Dzintars, acknowledges that the UN continues to support the leadership of the Colleges of VIDs.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit is threatening the establishment of a government.
Before 12 July, the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the deficit to 3% of the euro area’s GDP.
The calculations show that the deficit of the Portuguese budget at the end of the last year was 4.4% of GDP, but in Spain - 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC has not yet imposed sanctions against those two countries is that Euroscepticism has increased in many European Union countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative trends.
Critics also point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, since the beginning of agreement on uniform rules and then unable to apply them in life.
For example, German Bundesbank President Jens Veidmanns pointed out that Europe is losing its own confidence by creating a public show that the European Union rules are recommended rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the budget deficit deadline until the end of this year to Portugal and Spain by 2018.
The European Commission aims to examine the progress made by both countries within the next few months, at the same time indicating that both Spain and Portugal need to be ready to introduce additional storage measures, if required.
The initial projections show that Portugal could achieve its objectives at a certain time and that the budget deficit could be reduced by up to 2.5% of its gross domestic product this year.
This means that within the Stability Programme, this country's government has to implement savings measures by 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget of this year, with additional attention to the control of the cost of purchases of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more difficult.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, in the next two years, the consolidation measures must be 0.5% of GDP per year.
In particular, it would be difficult to achieve these objectives, which has made it difficult for the political parties of Spain to agree on the establishment of the government for eight months, and it is becoming increasingly possible for Spain to be able to make a third-time parliamentary election during the third year.
However, the public opinion argues that the third election would not change significantly in the country of the political soul.
The most popular party still has the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, a party of people led by the popular party, which would have a 33% vote again.
Their popularity has increased slightly only socialists, while the popularity of "Podemos" or "We Can Together" and "Ciudadanos" or "Pilsons" has slightly decreased.
The People's Party wishes to achieve the involvement of socialists and Ciudadans in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit a draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission by mid-October.
As announced by the representative of the Parliamentary Group of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, if the government does not exist and the election of Parliament will also be held a third time, Spain will become a whole European threat.
The purity of the river is critical in the coast of Riga.
In the fifth year of the plague, activists concluded that, unfortunately, each year, the number of missing remains is increasing, and here it is expected to be the largest of the visitors.
The most affected places are Riga.
In the capital city’s home, it is clear that it is difficult every day to reach out to people, but to fight against unclean visitors is difficult.
In addition, waste left in the ground during waste gases can be disposed of in water, thus damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja’s beaches and certain places in Kurzemé, the cleanliness of the beaches in Latvia is critical.
This announcement has been distributed this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaigns.
For five years, measuring the road along the Riga Seabed, activists have concluded that the number of wastes left by the population has increased every 100 metres.
Unfortunately, this year this critical assessment has taken place.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of wastes at 100 metres can possibly exceed 200 units," said Janis Ulme, the representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Latvia's Radio is well known, he's found in your beach, where he's going on a free route along the Riga Sea Lake.
This year, between the various wastes of life and the rest of the picnics, activists have come to collect even the sunlight that is left at sea.
The transitional participant and organizer Ulme said that the attack directly affected the people.
"The main source is the same beach visitors, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, different wastes, starting with meats, plastic holes that are already in the waste stage, they are no longer able to identify them, and tastes, bottles, baskets," says Ulme.
Among the cleanest beaches there are also the pellets of Riga.
For example, in Daugavgrí every 100 metres, nearly 800 waste units are collected, which are critically large.
The organizers of the campaign also make it clear that they are also on the road to taste and not all of the signs of a warning or ban.
"The average figures for all three Riga peld sites together - Daugavgriv, Westernbulli and parents - unfortunately meet far too large and far above the desired or desired goal of which it, like Latvia, is to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes the environmental defense.
Cleaning places in Riga every day, the summer’s hottest days even two times, the clear representative of the House of Commons Ugis Midauski.
However, fighting against unclean visitors is not easy.
We're going back to this people's cultural issue.
"With those who are tired, drink alcohol, smoke and do everything they can't do, even special signs will not work," says Midauski.
Therefore, the Vidauskis invites visitors to report to the police about the attackers.
It can be called police, safely pointing to these violations and thus fighting everyone.
Perhaps you can make some new warnings, but, as I said, it's either like a radical change in the situation.
"Since all of us must simply act together and be inappropriate against such offenders," he said.
As long as water quality measurements have already been carried out this summer, a health inspection that may establish a ban on official landfills has been carried out this week.
Even now, like other years, the quality of water is always good and satisfying.
At present, the situation is that the quality of water in all 56 pools has been good all the time and that there is no restriction on landing.
"The last time we'll take the analysis at the end of August," said the oldest environmental expert in health issues Normand Kadíís.
The remaining wastes on the soil may be disposed of in water during the intense gas supply.
This may, in turn, affect its quality, as the environmental expert points out.
The rotations in Russia continue - the change in the management of Putin.
Do you love your pameta?
Vladimir Putins announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov would like to take this action on his own, and will continue to be the Special Representative of the President in matters of nature's protection, ecological and transport.
When reporting about the changes, Putin's TV camera gave Ivanov a welcome address: "Sergey Borisovic, we've worked with you for many years together and we've done it successfully."
I am satisfied with how you fulfill your responsibilities.
I would like to remind you of our agreement not to use you in the office of the Head of Administration of this President for more than four years.
Therefore, I will wisely resist your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new topic too.
However, it is clear that the management of the presidential administration is a very important topic and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the upcoming election of the State Council in Russia, the concerns were raised that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the political elite of Russia.
Ivanovs was also referred to as possible in the position of the Vice-President of Putin, so the claim that he himself wished to take the position of the President on matters of nature and transport raised doubts.
As shown by the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs is the General Public Security Service of the VDK and Federal Security Service.
Ivanovs was a sensible and close Russian President Vladimir Putina.
He started his watch in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President, Boris Jelcin, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putin’s arrival at power, Ivanova’s "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, including the restoration of national censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister for Defence of Russia, but already in 2005, Prime Minister Mihaila Fradkova was responsible for the development and export of arms to the Russian defence industry.
Now, after the presidential administration's appointment, Ivanovs has also remained in Russia's National Security Council, where I am also working with the new President's administration manager Vaino.
Vaino comes from a family council party.
The president's board of directors of Vaino was recommending Ivanov himself.
We've been acquainted with Anton Eduardovic since.
From the time we worked in your government.
And in the last five years, almost five years, we have been contacted practically every day.
"That is why I am convinced that, after all the professional and personal characteristics of the character, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
Vaino comes from a family belonging to the elites of the Soviet Party.
His father, Karls, took high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The Internet issue "Meduza" refers to the book "Ignaian self-determination and independence" which, at the end of the 1980s, Karl Vaino asked Moscow to authorize the use of force against demonstrators.
However, he suddenly received a rejection and soon lost his temper.
A short time later, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work under the management of the President's Protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks Russia has been affected by the arrest of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.
As Politology points out, President Vladimir Putins remanded the elite before the elections expected in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing presence of representatives of the strong structures at the leading summits.
He's also dying in Nikiforenko's death in the first war of the Olympics.
This was the first time the war was, and the Latvian killer killed his participation in the Olympics ended at 17th place.
Trenneris Olíegs Baskins Latvijas Televisia acknowledges that Nikiforenko's hope was very small, and it was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that the dead man had been found guilty of a crime in the war.
Interestingly, in order to get to the Olympics, Nikiforenko came to start in a category of weights other than its experience - i.e. in a weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani coast was more than 25 pounds [25 kg].
It has already been reported that in the category of weights up to 100 kilograms of Jevgenius Bordovko war against Rjunosuki remained for two minutes until the opponent issued a fair victory prize.
Thus, the death penalty for Latvia has been closed.
The dreams go down in Rio's milk.
The fourth day was introduced by the Jewish Jewess Bordovko.
Yes, he was a more titled opponent, but he was able to overcome ambition at times.
He didn't say.
Arthur Nikiforenko’s task was even more challenging because his experience was smaller and he was also respected.
The result is similar, though, to him he kept his tea in half a minute longer than Bordovko.
Unfortunately, in the last few years, the lives of Latvians have been very short of ambition.
Since the federation's leadership, Gunnar Chisson and his financial studio Vladimir Šestakovs have gone from Latvia to Aleksandr Jackević, no longer called "Golden Score", - the development of the dead by means of a flood line.
Jackević, who here consults Kazakhstan's Jews, and Vsevoldam Zelónia, is not seeing the survivors.
But if you don't wake up, you won't.
And it's the federation's preference.
As a result, from the rest of the galaxy, the Latvian Federation of Judo urged Rio to cut off the medals.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening, we looked forward to the beach volleyball masks Samoilov/Shmēdiņš - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga as already in the "death" group - the losers have finished the game.
Latvia's duvet had a slight deviation - it could also be lost, but not more than with the four points in two sets.
The tension was still growing in the early game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windscreen for the entire game.
To players, the brother - in - law wind caused additional difficulties.
At first, they thought it might be ours - which is more universal - publicized.
But he didn't.
To play in Latvia was almost simple here.
He's been serving Samuel and waiting for him to fly.
The first set at the end and at the beginning of the first set of seats against the Canadian flag, because the load was not too high.
In those days, the harvest was small, but when it was, it was over, it was over.
The Brazilian Samoilovs with Shmeedian could win two sets, because the first took control of 16:15, however, also stayed on 16 points, also extending the lost point limit.
But it could also be lost with 0:2, because the second set was negative -4, however, also thanks to the wind, came out to win.
The third has already been arrested on the mark of Evandre's servants.
In the event of a chained service, the second game will soon fly too close to the network, and Samuel has remained quite a few options for the resulting attack.
If there was a neighbor of Samuel in the area, he was more successful this time, and only the loss of Sasu would be unprofessional.
Kreile also made a mistake, and it is very symbolic that he went straight to the last bomb block.
They're losing the team.
There is a certain lack of action right now - only two Evans' attacks on the third floor almost flew out of the map, but the bomb still hit the line.
Two steps were close to the line.
I'm also going to fight episodes of video for good opponents.
If Evandru played with the servants in the first two games, they were very productive for us.
All of the total loss on the table.
The reasons for failure should now be carefully analysed.
It may have been necessary for many to live near the stadium, not together with a delegation in the Olympic City.
It's been two and a half hours on the road.
Perhaps a few self-reliances introduced a seven-sided series of semi-finals.
It may not have been necessary to play in Klagenfurt, but to get in here faster and better acclimatize.
There may have been an error with the discovery of a sports uniform.
In the meantime, I have more than answers to the question.
Our final games are over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some world-class tournaments, as well as the Journey Masters.
The curse on Samuel’s life has never been a friend, and it will not be because there are too many different personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When a dream of Olympic medals is broken, there can also be the idea of divorce, because the blame will be sought not only by itself but also by a partner.
Decision-making is not difficult, but much more difficult will be found in Latvia.
The two brothers are on their way, but Janny and Tom have already tried and broke up, but Michael Samoilov is still too green to start digging the world’s surface.
You can try to return to the Black Sea by Harald Regju, Alexander Solovej, Edgar Tocz, but it will not be better than this option that has not just once proved itself during World War II.
Copabacan’s sweetness did not strike them this time.
A visa.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that the pludmal volleyball is becoming more popular, more recently, and only a rare growth is less than two metres.
This does not yet guarantee success, but it is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Our spirits don't stay.
For sportsmen and journalists, it is possible to meditate on the places offered by game managers and also choose your own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, and some tennisists do not stay in the Olympic city.
Also, a part of the football club has visited a hotel in Copababá.
In the meantime, prices were strongly exceeded for journalists who were offering all the reliable nights.
Therefore, the choice is also critical of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes they may not be from a logical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovic, we rent apartments on the Copabacan and Ipanema border.
Pludmale 200 metres away, a half-hour drive away.
The area is quite safe because the favela is far away, but you can't lose your mood either.
Vladimir Vladimirovic is not what some people think right away, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. seems to have been shot again on Friday morning.
100 metres in the bar and the tallest Laura Ikanice-Admidinja returned from their personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a ten-year break, "Porgijs and Besa" was released in Liepa.
The first study of the Portuguese and Besa opera was held in Latvia in 1973 at the National Opera of Latvia.
Since then, the internationally recognized headquarters has not been rebuilt.
That is why the organizers of the Czech Art Festival and the Liepaja art forum have decided in close cooperation to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Géršvina’s hat.
"We are very happy that after ten years of interruption, when the last time Liepaja could enjoy the study of the opera, this great version of the concert of the opera "Porgijs and Besa" by George Géršvina is blessed with us in the new, newly-opened concert "Great dinner", says the concert "Great dinner" director of the Bible God.
The opera "Porgijs and Besa" is a story of love, its inconsistency, shame, as well as the tragedies of life and the simple everyday enjoyments.
It reflects the afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
This is precisely the lack of policy correction in this operation, the exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," said director Viesturs Kairis.
What I like most - by listening to or repeating this opera, there are always such touching points - famous melodies, famous motives, but these transitions from one character to the other, revealing one person or another's character, or race or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building," the opera assesses the opera's musical director and director of the "Porgijs and Besa" concert.
Opera visitors agree that this is a grand event.
They have the great joy of hearing the famous Christmas opera in this world.
It is commendable that in Libya, the spirit of the world can be just.
"Completion professional", the opera is evaluated by the visitor Edgars Lamas.
The concert study was special in that the new open concert hall "The Great Dintar" was the first time the orchestra was played by an orchestra and the first time an opera concert was held.
The garden at the Museum of Art could be named in the name of New Rosenthal.
Rīga's vice president Andris Ameriks Rosenttal's exhibition revealed that the museum's own address could also be not the Christmas Valdemara island 10a, but the New Rozentala area 1.
Mára Láce, director of the Museum, acknowledges that the re-registering of the address will create a serious bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the proposal of the municipality.
In 1936, the city of Riga was founded on this idea by creating the memories of Burkarda Dzena to Janim Rosental, who was standing at the museum.
The former director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvitis, was one of the initiatives to create this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
All the time I've had a little heart attack - but Wilhelm Purvitis, where do we leave his name?!
"Well, if you, Mr. America, swear to think about it," said Lace.
It was reported that the National Museum of Art was officially opened this May following a massive reconstruction and modernization of its doors.
Finally, the construction of the VEF Culture City will begin this week.
About 11 million euros will be returned to the SIA "Velve".
The plan is to renovate several urban areas, including two viewers, as well as the building to adapt to people with traffic disturbances.
The Riga Council has decided to attach the European Union funds to a project of EUR 6 million, but the Director of the Riga Specialist Department of the Riga Council, Olegs Burovs, acknowledges that there is still no complete clarity about the European funds for the project.
"Despite the political desire to start VEF Culture's choice of reconstruction work by joining the European Structural Funds, we are awaiting a decision, a real action by the officials of the Ministry of Finance, will be granted or not," Burovs said.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to decide on its own decision not to make a decision here.
Now we see that there is another kind of debate again, so let's see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to point out that Riga's idea guarantees that this process will start and end in time," Burovs said.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture City collectively held a retreat concert immediately before the expected renovation of the building.
Although over the past year, the renovation of the building has not yet begun and has continued to work collectively under inappropriate conditions.
In the Rīga House's Special Department strategy, the refurbishment of the VEF Culture City seems to be divided into independent refurbishment works, where each will ensure the implementation of the functions of the different cities.
The first is the increase in the availability of VEF Culture City and the improvement of the surrounding territory.
It is intended to compile environments and engineering communications, as well as to update the building phase.
Second - Improving the offer of services in VEF Culture City.
It plans the restoration of the interior, walls and stairs, the improvement of the visual and sound records, as well as the collection of internal engineering communications of the building.
Thirdly, improving the collective working conditions of the creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve staff equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before "Livu" 40th edition, a legendary team can be present at the exhibition in Liepa.
The exhibition will look at various "Livus" features - photographs that are posted on the time line to reflect group activity from the beginning until 2010 when the group is notified of the end of its work.
The attendance rates, musical instruments, awards and concerts of participants will also be shown, as well as other events that have not yet been seen to the public, reflecting the activities of the "Live" group.
The exhibition will be complemented by the contents of the Liepaj Museum store.
The exhibition's visual design became in cooperation with the fashion artist and artist Elitu Patmalnik.
The musicians who had been associated with the "Live" group and their neighbors also called and shared the invitation with objects and memories.
"Livu" was first sought in 1972 when a vocal instrumental assembly led by Juris Pavitol was established in the Liepääan cultural home.
The assembly took part in its original composition in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the sight of cities and republics.
In 1976, a legal meeting was held when Juris Pavitol met with a group in the town of Erica Chigel and Metalourgu culture, inviting to join Inrídu Gūtmani, Andri Krūzín and Jani Groduma.
Over the years, I haven't had any of this once in my group.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - we want to prove that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - remains unchanged.
"What you can see is no need to see - the gins, the mains and the leaves, these children feel separated from the sterreotype of the universal stranded star," said the music viewer Klaus Vávere.
In the group without the above-mentioned music, music such as Igo, Vilnius Krievinš, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Laimas Racenjas, Tallis Pusbarnies, Ainars Virga, Avars Brize, Guntars Mucenieks, Danis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.
She went to the show without any taxes.
The exhibition shall be viewed from 19 August to 30 October.
On August 27, Liepaja's concert hall "Puit, pigs" will be held in the "Live" group for 40 years of public music "LÉVIfest 2".

Zbignivs Stankevičs: The time is coming, and the truth is high.
In an interview with Zbignivs Stankevičs, the bishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia insists that if we want to gain life, the message of the Gospel must be in its centre.
For the power of truth is greater than the depth of evil.
Many are already on the way to the Most Holy of the Virgin Mary’s celebration in the Aglon.
What messages will the faithful there receive this year?
In recent years the desire to take the lead in the worship of Aglon has been expressed by the pope.
So, too, the content of the main message is in his word.
As for your tradition, it is also the fact that the Cross is led by the fate of Janis Bullis.
He will also make his own message.
In the past day, I took the lead in the sacred service of the Vigilian god.
Last year, I will address the French encyclical "Laudato si" and update the common home, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I'm watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to react to it.
My approach to meeting the church recommended that the Gospel message be held in the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most complex problems of human life and gives him the encouragement he needs to follow.
Then it's talking to people.
But in Jesus, in the lamp's discussion, you say that "he returns to understanding as a perfect man".
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person has turned away from the church’s history?
And is there such a resource for the church today?
In the capital city of India, there are dead men on the road.
In the capital of India, no one is aware of the death penalty for the road - it seems that he's been on the road for hours and then spread out, informs the BBC.
It is reported that the man who was identified as Matibúl walked on the market every day, but at night he worked for protection.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning he went home on the road when he got on a light car.
The surveillance camera record shows that the driver is separated from the car to see the victim and then deleted.
In an hour when no one else knew of the bleeding man, a spirit came upon him.
About 90 minutes after the accident, the police entered and found him in a hospital where he died from the trauma he experienced.
Referring to its candidate to the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the Director-General of the State Environment, Inga Koljegova, has rescued the government from drowning, the Associated Professor of the University of Latvia's Social Sciences College, Ojär Skudra.
The co-legislator's explanation of the withdrawal of the candidate in relation to the dispute in the ruling coalition is linked to the failure of the government.
Skudra's conversation with the agency led to the fact that he found it difficult to think that the next week at the government's meeting, "Unity" would support the College's candidate.
Similarly, if ministers of the United States voted against, while Collegiants were so approved, it would lead to government commissions.
The expert also believes that, prior to the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidate, Koljegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Danu Reiznieci-Ozol and the President of Minister Mauri Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also an attack on "Union", which strongly opposed its candidate.
In predicting whether you will be able to find an appropriate candidate with the help of the tender, Skudra acknowledges that there are two options - whether a compromise figure will be selected, or the institutions as the Executive Director-General will continue to run the Dace Pelè.
At the same time, he points out - if the Finance Minister has so far claimed that there is no other candidate, it is a house for Pelekaya that he cannot participate in the competition.
LETA has already reported that the Head of the State Environment Service has decided to withdraw its candidate to the title of the Director-General of the VID.
In response to the "union" opposition, the Government withdrew the approval of the College on Tuesday for a week at the meeting of the Director-General of the VID.
After the Government's decision to resign, Koljegova confirmed that he is still ready to become a VID leader.
However, later the idea changed - on Friday, when the Minister for Finance presented to Dana Reizniecei-Ozolai said that they withdrew their consent to transfer to the VID manager's task and this did not make her an easy choice.
Minister President Mara Kučinska, Secretary of the Press, Andrej Vaivars, LETA explained that a new competition will be held for the late VID Director-General.
An accident occurred in Riga City, where police car involved.
In the center of Riga this afternoon, a road traffic accident involving the State police car occurred.
The police car with the sound and light signals is on the top of the category, until the Krishna Barona and Dzirnav are on the crossroad with another car.
The police are clear of the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force does not support a long police car.
In the event of a woman's injury.
The number of people living in Riga this year
At the beginning of this year, Riga had 638,784 inhabitants, which is 0,34% less than in 2015, when the capital city officially registered 641,000 inhabitants, the LETA informed the Central Statistical Administration (CSP).
On the other hand, the number of people living in Latvia is increasing at 30th place between the capital cities of the European Union (EU) and the major cities in which the population is more than one million.
According to the EU Statistical Office Eurostat, Riga is the largest female figure - the capital of Latvia is certainly the first of the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capital cities in the Baltic States are the largest women in Europe's largest cities: in Vienna, they are 123, but in Tallinn 121 women are 100 men.
The warning icon will be displayed at LNMM.
In the next few days, at the Latvian National Art Museum (LNMM), warning signs will be posted - pictograms, the agency sent the representative of the Riga Department of Specialization of the Council of Riga to the agency.
It has recently been successfully completed by improving the speedy damage of the museum, which has resulted in the operation of the desk.
In the near future, a warning pictogram will be displayed.
They will tell the people that the follow-up may be a slender case and during the winter, it must not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, wheelchairs and wheelchairs.
In this social network, Facebook also wrote Ušakovs, which indicated that no security threats do not cause damage, but "sees unaccompanied", and the schedulers "will do it".
Saints for children and parents - Riga equipped with new children's wheelchairs.
In this summer season, Riga’s municipality set up two other new railways in the city of Chipsala and Chiykurkal, which are now available to children.
A wide, multifunctional wheel ship is installed on the Chipsala beach with various heating elements, tanks, games, drums and slippers.
Rotary field is intended for all children of all ages.
The field also includes the elements of the sulphur and various balance sheets.
The World of Fantasies complements the attraction position in the Daugava coast with the view of the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there.
On the other hand, in the field of bicycles between the Chiykurkalna 4 and 5 crossing lines, the game name, boat, step track, equivalent foot, tuts, wheel pumps and other game elements, as well as the winning zone with lines of power and coordination training, including sports elements.
The rubber sequence of the soil is composed of different colors.
Up to the wheeled village on the side of the street is a new, colourless bridge follow-up.
In the woods, a rebuilt road has been opened.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC), as well as the construction of the SIA "Binders" and municipal representatives today opened the national main road border of Russia (Grebnnuveva) - Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuvas border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to Lithuania border (156,4-163.05 km).
Roads are a national visit card, especially border roads, so a special pleasure is to find a rebuilt step on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of improving the situation on the main road in the country, thanks to the co-financing of the European Union funds.
"As the projections show, the available resources for this planning period will be available already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most heavily loaded cars in quality, and also ensure the mobility of people in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union," said Uldis Augulis, turning around the symbolic plane.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvian roads will be presented to the Government in the near future.
Construction phase from Medumi to the Lithuania border (156,4,163,05 km) SIA Binders started to fall and continued this year after technological interruption.
The restructuring costs are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstruction phase, the construction of the road has been fully renewed and the next year will be refurbished from Medumi to Daugavpilj itself, thus harmonizing all roads from Lithuania to Daugavpilj," LVC President Janis Lange told.
The main road in the country is most crowded, and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all main road in the country is in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, to ensure periodic maintenance and to change the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"There will, of course, be a need for adequate funding, and all road users with hopes will look forward to the proposals made by the expert group to coordinate the road financing system," noted Lange.
The linkage and lighting of roads within the project centre of Medumu.
Significant land operations have been carried out: four stages of a large recovery and extensive recovery and recovery work, compared to the road gate profile, which has so far been very uneven.
Renewed public transport facilities are also restored and restored to the area of return to public transport.
In the past, the roads were insufficient insatiable and the terrain was not transparent because of the mountain slopes, as well as the old road along the common railway.
In the next construction season, it is planned to renew the road phase from the city border of Daugavpils until now to the rebuilt stage (144.80-156.40 km).
This year the LVC plans to carry out various kinds of work more than 1100 km of national road.
Information on all the repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvcelli.lv.
"To achieve the desired results of weight reduction, it is very important to choose the right combination of food products," admits Lithuanian Dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklirieren.
In addition, it is easy to grow during the summer period when our own garden produces fresh fruit, vegetables, and vegetables.
The combination of processed food products can help not only to reduce the weight of the waste but also to contribute to the various processes of the body.
Macaroni and etiquette are a successful combination, as it provides long-term sense of taste and helps fight fats.
The studies published in the European Clinic’s Journal have shown that ethics has a positive effect on blood glucose and helps us to be fair to the world.
The rich food of kine peppers and protein products, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, causes not only the taste of salt but also reduces the color after great meals in the next mealtimes.
The combination of such foods may also increase by up to 35% after the meal.
Studies show that Caina’s peppers can help relieve the burden of fat in the soil.
The oil contains a potent substance - Holin, while the pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amount of this food may reduce the level of cortisol, including weight gain around the body's average.
There is another layer of fresh and fatly cooked pasta that is worth incorporating in your food card.
The tissue surfaces and the lungs contain liquids that control the graline according to Canadian scientists ’ conclusions - absorbed stimulating hormones - and thus a sense of exacerbation.
In addition, the oils contain polyphenols that are good for weight reduction and do not allow fat to be formed.
Plants and proteins can also perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can create a sense of humor.
The plants contain water and liquids and thus promote salt feeling.
At the same time, the protein slows down the aging process and ensures that the salt feels for a longer period of time.
In the afternoon you can eat everything with salads or also prepare protein cocktails from the ready mixture and enjoy them together with your favorite fruits.
Avoid combinations of products.
In plants there are cyrics - monosharids or disacharides - one or two molecules compounds.
On the other hand, the wall in the garden is a polysacharide.
Plants are divided mechanically into the stomach and are not chemically divided until the third or fourth degree of inflammation occurs in the skin.
The wall is divided into three different stages that are already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat salt food immediately after meals.
Eating salt food immediately after meals, it is "exploited" in the kitchen with other foods where it is not chemically dried and begins to smell.
Do not eat meat, potatoes, pigs, bananas, data or other carbohydrates containing products with lemons, bananas, oranges, grapefruits, pineapple fruits, pineapple or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptaliline in the liver only works in the urine.
Plant acid stops not only the dehydration of carbohydrates but also promotes their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, fats and meat, cheese and oil or cheese and fats, meat and milk, oil and milk or fats and the combinations of rich and similar protein products in one meal.
It is necessary to process various strains, each with different strengths, characteristics and time when it is to be reached in the stomach.
Orbuz, honeymelon, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melones shall not be frozen if they are in the stomach with other food products.
Fats in combination with proteins for rich products.
Fats make a successful combination with fat, but the same cannot be said about fats and protein - fats stop the burning of proteins.
Olbaltum can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large number of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid the full use of fat.
It is also relevant for freshening - it is not recommended to combine a large quantity of rice (containing protein) with a healthy avocado (containing fat).
This combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How can you prepare?
"Preparation of food, thermal treatment results in a significant loss of nutrients - approximately 15 to 55% of the original ingredients of the product," says the Dietology.
In most cases, nutrients go to the loss of food in the water.
However, the value of certain foodstuffs is increased, directly by stealing.
After drying the remaining liquids are recommended for the preparation of soup - in this case you will not lose any food remaining in the water and you will be able to replace them later.
It is recommended to prepare and wash the dishes.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene in the tomato composition.
Tomatoes for 30 minutes increase the amount of lycopene by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, bourgeois, salted potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of oil and meat removes the natural properties of these proteins, making them easier to digest.
Similarly, the treatment of meat and egg thermal treatment makes the iron and other mineral substances present in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the concentration of products may reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, however, the melting of liquids does not affect.
In combination with tomatoes, iron intake in the body can be increased, which provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body takes up to 33% of non-blooded iron that is found in plant products such as beans, leaves, fatty vegetables, than blood-producing iron that is present in animal products such as beef, fish and whole.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blooded iron in the body by taking non-blooded iron products in combination with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes, and eggs.
Vitamin C helps to change non-bloody iron to make it easier for our body to absorb.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin, which ensures oxygen storage in muscles and brain cells.
For the maximum benefit of salads, add them to their healthy fats, such as olives or lichen oil.
When preparing butter with lass, add vitamin D to the rich lass or sardines of a free yogurt, which is a good calcium source.
vitamin D increases the amount of calcium in the liver and plays an important role in bone formation.
Auras (as well as other filling products) together with vitamin C sources such as soils, upens, avens and other fruit or eggs, help to stabilize cholesterol levels and avoid arterial contamination.
Snapchat "Anime" effect in criticism of tourism caricature
Snapchat representatives say this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this label effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality in an absurd way and play with their identity.
You can convert yourself into analytic, dog or image that will be used in the forest of Roja Lichtenstein.
The stars are mythical, pornographic instruments that generate more than 30 million transformed loans a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public opinion.
Snapchat’s effect on the skin has already been criticised by the fact that the app is popularized by too thin or bright eye tones as an ideal beauty essential.
This week, new cell effects were published that allow users to create the eyes, the eyes, the eyes and the lungs, and some critics accused it of racist Asian cartoons — “djealten’s schemes”.
The question was also raised whether such contradictions did not prove that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public negation occurred on Wednesday when the expenditures "The Verge" and "Motherboard" indicated that the impact of the leukemia has been removed from the application.
The company explained that the aim of the leukemia is to portray the images of Anime rather than to carrify the people of the island’s origin.
But people who have experienced racism have remembered these effects from painful stereotypes.
Other categories rejected the same as Anime.
The story of the Korean American art student Greis Sparapani Twitter has gained a wide range of reasonings. In an e-mail she notes that the impact of the label is "study and useless so as not to say more".
She adds that it is difficult not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian caricatures and the effects of lakes.
This shows that the light effect is not just the yellow face but the yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has been included in these cultural tracts.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we use every day.
And Snapchat, a large audience of young people representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat leks create an image that calls users, then "these things aren't remembered today," the fourth interview said 25 years old Keitija Zhou.
On Thursday, the company’s owner of Mediaum’s products destroyed their Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Media" and on the telephone, she explained that she understood that the problems of race are due to the employment policy of Snapchat, which is not enough to support racial diversity.
I critically criticized the company’s management, which consists mainly of white men and then closed its article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no differences in race in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Do some other racial representatives work in the company, but they do not take such a task so that they can express their views safely and easily," says the Chinese American.
She also agreed with others, while Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company shall not disclose the representative of different breeds, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but his representative discovered that the company had hired a staff specialist who would concentrate on also representing racial minorities which were not widely represented and promoted involvement in the company.
On the other hand, I will not renew my Snapchat account, adding: "I am interested in whether they really need more users like us to understand that this is wrong."
The Court of Congress has announced that the military officers have amended reports on the Islamic State.
On Thursday, the report issued by the Congress of the United States of America indicated that the United States of America's Central Volunteers had changed their reports, reflecting war against the Islamic state of Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than is true.
The analysis of the Central Volunteers survey reveals general discontent with the establishment of a temporary report by the representatives of the Committee of the Armed Forces, the Committee for the Exploration and the Sub-Committee for the Financing of the Communities, indicating that their management controlled reports on American support for the fight against the Islamic State.
The central charity known as Centcom is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of this report says that the intelligence reports approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than it is true. Indeed, it was regularly altered by reflecting better achievements than by other intelligence analyses.
The representative of the Republic of California, Kens Kalverts, says: "Centcom action is unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are sought in the highest management of the organisation.
This 10-hour report is detailed in the analysis and analysis of the existing problems of the Athenians in the review and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraq’s forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide any overwhelming evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration would have left the reports to be altered, it shows that Centcom’s management has made a known pressure on analysts to reflect a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that in the first half of 2015 the Central Administration Press Relations, Reports and Reports to Congress represented the situation in a much more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, Centcom’s representatives publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Republic of Kansas Party, Mike Pompeo, in his report, writes: "The investigation for several months clearly proves it."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States Central Management Chief Officers have revised reports, reflecting ISIS’s risks to Iraq more low than they were actually.
The Republican Party set up a working group, knowing that the analysts are concerned that the information about the Islamic State is being altered.
To continue the investigation, the report published on Thursday will follow up on the new findings in this case.
The General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence shall carry out an investigation of the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Committee on the Management of the Exploration Committee have published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with the conclusions of the Working Group of the Party of Republicans.
The representative of the Democrats, Adams B. Šifs, in his report, sent a letter that, from 2014 to 2015, Centcom had more limited the preparation of the evaluation reports on the intelligence services related to the ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Šifa explains that this process "stopded the dissemination of information", has undermined the ethicality of the analytical work and has "distributed the facts contrary to the truth."
But the members of the Party of Šifs and Democrats add that there is no evidence that the White House has made a pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports, according to the "pre-defined or political position".
On Thursday, The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of a convention survey.
In August, The New York Times reported that the general inspection of the Pentagonist began an investigation on the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, the representative of Pentagon, announced that Pentagon would not make comments on the report of the Congress until the investigation continued.
He also adds that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and Hearing Management calls for a constructive dialogue on key national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by the Ministry of Defence more and more).
But last year's complaint raises doubts as to whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports provided by the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot points.
The criticism of the Islamic State's observation calls to mind more than ten years ago when Centcom's poll analyst Gregory Hökers published a study claiming that the administration of George V. Bush started the Afghan war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hukker also played an important role in the opening up of the question of the Islamic state of affairs.
Last year, the official representatives reported that the Hükker team discovered that contrary to public reports, air raids on the Islamic State oil industry did not significantly affect the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
In the September issue, The Times reported that this discovery did not occur outside the central management walls.
At the time of Centcom Commander General Lloyds Ostins III, he received a series of criticisms, because many legislators believed that the reports of the war described the situation too positively.
In April, General Ostins withdrew and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votels.
In the United States, along with British women's hockey field, the United States has won, so it has already won a fourth victory in order.
The day after the victory over Japan with the result 6:1, the fourth day Keitia Bama won the first two names of the U.S. women's field hockey team in good time when Americans won the Indian team with the result 3:0.
The five - year - old Bama said that she could never remember what it would have done to her.
She said, "I don't feel."
I'm not one of those people who count their names.
But she knows that the American result in Olympic games is 4:0, which gives them in their group no distinction with Britain, which, on the fourth day after the victory over Japan with the result 2:0, remained unsatisfied.
Britain and the United States will be going on Saturday to play the last game in the first round.
The two teams have already qualified for the fourth final and the game will only determine who will take the first place in the six teams and who will be the second.
The first winner will soon avoid meeting with the strong Dutch class, which is the leader of the second group.
Despite the unopened six-day game, Americans have already called a surprise wind four years ago in London to take the last place between 12 teams.
There was also Bama's command.
His uncle in Blube, the village hockey girl was the first to get her hands on at 3 years of age (her older twin sisters had already worked with this type of sport) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in history.
She wasn't at the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get to the end.
However, in 2012 she and her team failed.
In the following year, trainers were appointed to the English Kregs Parham and all changed to the good side.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London, we did not invest as much as we do now.
We've completely changed everything.
In the fourth day of the game, Bama discovered the result by getting names in the first half with a back-up time from the nearby distance.
India's game began without a win in its account, but their reading was very exciting and held a minimum result 0:1 until the third period ended when Bama again gained the names.
She introduced bombs to the enemy zone on the side of the village, then she pointed out to be on the middle of the village and to call the bombers on behalf of the enemy, pointing to the Americans under 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzales received another name.
This was the first U.S. game to be played by Jackie Brigas, each of the first three games to be played by one.
She's trapped.
And so is Bama.
"We're going very well now," said Pahams, but how well, it will show the game on Saturday.
The most delicious food during the period of depression is "Study maltite"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of President Franklins Delano Rüzvelts, he sat in an oval room to stay in bed.
President Rūzvelt was inspired by the delicate delicateness of the culinary, such as the waxing of the liver, either in the ugrea and Merlanda bronchos.
But now her bed was a bit more reliable: filled with oil at the top of the tomato, a bottle of potatoes and in the desert - a flame bottle.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "This is the way to solidify food preparation with people who wore very heavy."
Her husband, Andrjø Kou, adds: "It's also a message for Americans to eat."
The passage from the Brooklyn Heights area is a food historian.
Kou's last book, "Derzein Suuttämätung" describes Chinese virtuve in America, but Ziegelmane in his book "97 Abels" describes life through the food house in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Saturday meal", published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in the culinary, they held meals together with the "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop" reporters, a simple afternoon meal in the Flatroin region and worked since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929.
At 54 years of age, Ms. Ziegelmanes ordered butter with dried cheese and mixed olives, while 57 years old Kou ordered teas, potatoes, and vegetables salads.
When the rapporteur ordered a false complaint, several admitted that her choice was very appropriate for the discussion on the Great Depression dinner .
Mrs. Ziegelmane told me that the fake poison was very popular.
There was an earthquake, an earthquake, and an earthquake.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meals.
Imagine what it is like to open so many maps so that they are in the middle of the day.
Mr. Kou's novelty.
"It's almost as if the beast is full of pigs," he added.
In the early years of depression, the average American table was similar to the starboard, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their men's breads, lunches, and evenings were given freshly prepared snacks.
During the first world war, the Americans sent food directly to Europeans. "Study maltite" described how Americans adapted to conditions when the Americas were no longer overfilled.
"At that time food became the main object of the American people's attention every day," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this subject.
It also became important for the new budget diets: such unknown food as fake bread and vegetables became daily, it was "a great way to use surpluses," noted Mrs. Ziegelmane, as it was almost possible to hide undesirable ingredients under the creamy measuring.
The fresh fruits were replaced by light ripe fruits.
The meat, which for years had been a major component of American cuisine, now became an extremely rare luxury product.
During the time when the number of calories and food intake was more important than the noise, the young generation, still did not see the formations.
How old Mrs. Ziegelmane, described in her book, finds recipes to prepare a symphony filled with ground cream.
Mr Kou adds, "This was not a popular addition to the afternoon table."
Mrs. Zeegelmane points out, "It was serene."
The earth’s softness and phytosanitary syphilis are not compatible.
Many home meal recipes were applied in difficult times.
Family economists such as Luise Stelli, head of the Federal Family Economics Office from 1923 to 1943, determined the state's eating facilities that were not experienced before and after the Great Depression.
By publishing letters and recipes and magazines, they encouraged homeowners to become "economics" and to face challenges such as turning macaroni and burcan corn into spiritual malt.
"Superious Malta" is a love of historical virtue.
It is particularly interesting to see evidence of the government's attitude towards its expelled citizens, such as President Herbert Hüvera's "let me eat chicken".
Although he publicly told of his simple childhood and eating in Ai, he was actually eating as a small millionaire for what he had become.
Mr Kou says, "He stayed in Europe's kitchen, for example, a fish with a ball bearing."
He eats almost a rededicated guest table while wearing lunch jackets.
He was completely out of reality.
President Ruzvelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not recommended him to show her an example with her eating habits.
The book says that Rūzvelts hired a domestic worker who did not teach to prepare to eat, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most delicious foods was delivered in Washington, but also the worst prepared foods".
As soon as the national economy is back, most of the crisis is caused by the spread of the culinary glands.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as to how to use science in the kitchen, Mrs. Ziegelmane adds.
The book says that they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as her inability to eat outside food.
"She really was afraid to eat outside," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said, "She actually betrayed people."
Once there was an incident with the windshields.
When we were eating in Eisenberg's restaurant, a couple of writers came out of the room to prepare a dessert: a flame bottle, which President Rüzvelts tried to eat in the afternoon.
"It's a flood blast," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, adding that there was still a widespread introduction to delicious foods.
It does not contain dust, only dried fluids, a few milk, sugar, water and canals.
All of them were impatiently dressed in the brown meat that was found on the solvents.
Unfortunately, it wasn't even that bad.
Mr. Kou is waiting for some more cums.
After listening to the experienced "economicist", he said to the women, "A little bit of a sleek-smelted-and-smoker. "
Gilead receives compensation for legal expenditure in battle with Merck on Hepatitis C patent
The District Court has decided that ‘Gilead Sciences Inc’ has the right to return the costs of legal services that it has paid in case of the patent of Hepatitis C against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the United States Federal Court of Justice had found a violation of Mark's operation, for example, after the transfer of winter and other non-ethnic activities.
On the fourth day of the case, U.S. District Justice Bets Labson Frimens stated that Gilead was entitled to request compensation for legal expenses incurred by it in this case.
Merck is trying to obtain positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with new births for hepatitis C, which is effective 90% in liver disease.
The case was initiated in 2013 when both Gilead and Merck were invited to try to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component of sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
The US-supported forces claim that they have completely taken control of the city of Manbidz from the Islamic State.
The US-supported forces in their control of the completely occupied parts of the northern part of the state of Manbidz in Turkey and the last soldiers of the Islamic State have left the city, the representative of the group announced on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) have now removed the city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet fled the city.
They have released more than 2000 civilians-citizens who have been sent by the perpetrators, and the news agency Reuters told Sharfan Darvis from the SDS General Military Council of Manbidz.
"The city is now in full control of us and we are looking for the perpetrators," he informed the agency Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and several paid the federal tax rate 34.2 per cent.
Hilaria Clinton published a 2015 tax declaration showing that the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and paid the federal tax rate by 34.2 per cent, respectively.
In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million to its Clinton charity organisation. Former President Bill Clinton won about $5.3 million, representing a soldier and former state secretary, received $3 million from his work at the State Department, which was published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election was published in the United States by Senator Tims Keins and his wife Anna Holtone published his tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillaria Clinton and Tims Keins continue to set new financial transparency standards," said Klinton's partner, Jennifer Palmieri.
On the other hand, Donald Tramps hides behind various agents and interviews so as not to comply with the agreements to reveal his tax information.
The publication of tax information paid is a record practice for the candidates of the President of the United States, but it does not require legislation.
New York businessman Tramps and his lawyers, my government revenue service audit as a reason for not revealing tax information.
"Your guide", in his Twitter entry, sent Ian Sams to Clinton's campaign partner about the tax information of the Democratic Party's candidate.
On Thursday, Trampa Special Adviser Michael Kohens informed CNN that he would not allow Trampam to publish tax information before the audits were completed.
Trampa criticism, including the candidate of the president of the Republic Party for 2012 Mits Romnia and other Republicans, argues that his refusal raises questions about his real assets, the amount of his contributions and other obligations, including his business obligations with Russia.
Clinton joined the oil fire on Friday by publishing a video where several influential Republicans asked Trampu to publish their tax information.
She returned to Michigan on Thursday during the economic discussion.
She said: "He refuses to do what the other president's candidates have done for decades."
“Politic” says that in 1990 Tramps paid very little or not taxes during two years, and on Friday the author of the New York Times reported that many readers and lawyers believe that nothing has changed as well as today.
The federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of Varena Bafeta's billionaire proposal, has popularized the idea that tax must be paid by at least 30 % per year for each of the more than 1 million dollars.
This proposal is also supported by President Barak Obama.
Last week at Clinton's meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where there is also his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Buffet invited Tramp to exchange with tax declarations.
Bafets said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Klintoni now lives in Japan, New York and the period 2007-2014 has paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent and the total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was the low cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Hebrew film director criticises a hotel in Berlin about the closure of Israel's telephone code after a request for war - RT News
The director of the Hebrew film of French films said in the wind on social media when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code.
Clods Lancmans, a documentary film about the Holocaust director Shoah, did not hide his discontent with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmans tried to find Israel’s telephone code in the hotel list offered.
However, this country was not included in the list with the countries to which it can be referred directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, in the new German capital, Israel was deafened and destroyed?
Raksta Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancmans writes that the answer received was "they were shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "this is a well-known hotel management decision".
The reason for the removal of the code was even more confusing to the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the removal of the Israel code," Lancmans explains in another hotel worker's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung writes that Israel's Ambassador to Germany Jakovs Hadas-Handelsman is present in this case as a "great cow".
We're surprised and shocked about this incident.
It's the same for yourself and a great beauty.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, right on this hotel network, is even greater decline.
No explanation is required.
Amatperson said, "We believe the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also came to be quite widespread on the Internet, where people claimed it as a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel was simply created by an Arab customer.
Another entry sent "to know", indicating that the hotel is located near the synagogue near Kurfurstendam.
The issue of Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all the translations, stating that this is all "responsibility" and has abandoned Lancmana.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung, another representative of Kempinski, said.
And it adds that the code goes back to add to the list.
The police use rubber and steel gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The students and police encounters took place on Thursday in the city of Sanpaulu, Brazil, where students participated in a demonstration against government education reform.
The police used rubber and steel gas against the students.
The problems began when the lawyers tried to fire the students, as a result the police used rubber and steel gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their discontent with the reform of the education system.
Sanpaulu Governor Geraldo Alckmina's proposal provides for close to 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some of the demonstrators drew on the wall graphics with messages against the interim President Michael Themer.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when the students in police demonstrations aimed at providing support to the deputy President, Dilma Rosefia, who had been voted in favour of the opposition.
Scott Kelums Skinner ends first, bringing the British gold medals into circulation
Kelum Skinners from Scotland finished his first team of men racing teams in Rio, which took place last night. The British team won its champion title, which it won in the 2012 London games.
The 23-year-old sportsman from Glazgov played an important role in these conversations by making a nice legitimist shot by Sir Krissus Hojo and choosing a victory for the favorite New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprising victory when Hoys defeated five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championship in London, even though Hoys had already finished his sport career.
The problems were at a stage between Beijing and London Olympics, as experienced beginner James Stafu came to replace.
It's been done for them for the last time.
When Hoys left, he tried to fill his place with Kians Emadi and Mets Krampton.
Britain’s coaches still hope for Skinner, considering the potential he later demonstrated.
Hindus, Kenya - champions who started with Hoju and Skinner four years ago, who installed the Olympic Qualifications Record, but the best known start was the New Zealand team
However, the British trio gained gold medals.
The Hindus were in close contact with the natives, Kenijs took over the leadership, and Skinners took over the leadership.
The strategy change played an important role in winning, as Hindus moved with a greater shift to allow Kenya and in particular Skinner to move faster.
Hoys observed the conversation as a BBC representative and stopped the eyes of Skinner, Kenya, and Hindus as they raced to the beautiful 5th table.
The 23-year-old glaucoma said, "This was an inevitable betrayal."
I do everything I can to protect my name.
We finally installed the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was just incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoju in 2012 in the Olympic Games in London, Hindus realizes that their ranks have fallen on track after a failed start.
He then reiterated this comment, and British competitors were not able to prove the opposite.
There was no such incident right now.
The Hindus said: "The British flag in the tribals brought back to the memory of London."
During the last three months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the winning of the Olympics was really special.
One medal will be a country that won seven out of ten medals for riding in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team progress indicator over the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could indeed resume Hoja’s achievements by acquiring three Olympic gold medals.
Kenya would mean six refined gold and one silver medal. Kenijs is also born on March 23 (it is considered to be a British holy date because this day has also been born Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rodgers Banisters).
In this data, Hoys is also born.
Kenya’s next words are the press that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
28 years old sportsman from Bolton said: "Now I'm just testing it.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because then you can win along with the team members.
If you're honest, then winning one is a little lonely."
He said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he's gonna have to go in the army."
That day it was the only war on medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sers Bredlijs Vigins, Eds Klensijs, Steve Burks and Owens Douls showed the fastest qualifying time in four kilometres of accommodation for four people.
His time was 3:51.943
The World Record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final will take place today on the second side of the day, where Vigins will certainly be in the centre of attention.
On the night before the qualification, he had a disagreement with the commissioner when the judges called him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey that will continue and conclude today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barker and Keitija Archibalda from Milgavia installed a new record 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British Ritengling Command will be held in the middle of the Olympic Games.
In view of the outstanding and unprecedented supply in Beijing and London, all expect the same achievements as Rio.
In the meantime, there have been various complaints about sex and respect, technical director Shein Satons withdrew, and Hoys and Victoria Bendleton have also finished their career.
However, starting with the first veldorom lines, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level in real time.
The future of Portland’s consignee becomes unclear because of the cut-off of a ambitious contract.
The future of the aluminium miners and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become unclear because its main client's energy company has announced the interruption of cooperation.
On the basis of this Communication, the Victorian Government plans to stop subsidisation of an energy company, which is essential to enable the company to continue its work.
The 20-year grant will be suspended in November.
Thus, more than 2000 Alkoas Portlenda industry is at risk.
Threats could be caused by both direct and indirect jobs up to 2000.
In addition, it will also have unexpected side effects, as it was causing a consumption of about 10 per cent of all Victoria electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa was arrested by Point Henry, which led to the interruption of the operation of the English power station.
Alcoa Portlenda's cooker works with losses and can be closed.
These events resulted in several years of prolonged speculation about the value of Australia's dollar and the cost of industrial production.
Agg energy supplier, who supplies energy from his Loy Yang A power station in Latroubes Iele, says that the remaining three owners will probably also terminate their contracts.
Most of the power stations belong to Alcoa and Alumia, as well as parts of the company also belong to the companies of China 'CITIC' and Japanese 'Marubine Corp'.
"AGL" hopes for the continuation of the operation of the Portland industry, which would mean the next supply chain," his representative said.
‘AGL’ stated that the contracts are the so-called ‘risk-limited contracts’ which are intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have 12 months of validity, so they will be valid until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the representative of the company.
The potential impact of the fiscal year 2018 on profit is limited to the forecasts of a favourable market for electricity wholesale prices in the future.
“AGL” claims that in its forecasts the losses of 187 million dollars have already been incurred , providing that these contracts will be terminated .
Alcoa is advised that the decision to conclude the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue or to supply energy to it.
The U.S. company reports that in 2010, it concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide an explanation of why it will cease its cooperation.
The analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland Basin in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago industry shortly from New York, due to the weak economy of the sector.
Last week, the Executive Director of AGL, Stevens Mikelson, said that 600 megawatts and 900 megawatts were used in Portland during the last year.
If both of these industries are driven from the energy market, the demand for energy will be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre employs 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected each year, and a reduction in the budget could make the situation worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, unprotected workers, violence victims and those who do not have the means to fight illegal exploitation are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been exceeded, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
Since next June, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than so far.
The Director of the Legal Centre of Queensland, James Farels, said that the latest report of the National Legal Centre Association reports that legal assistance is now denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr Farels pointed out that if this decision was not rejected, the situation would only get worse.
He also said: "The Vienna legal centre has always received insufficient funding, which means that the aid is rejected by thousands of people who need it."
For people who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debt, families with divorce, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has reduced funding by 30 per cent, which means that more than a thousand more people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to suspend the reduction of funding immediately so that those in need of legal assistance can obtain it.
Last year, the Government opened its plans to establish a level of legal aid to the national average.
Now it is time to pay attention to the needs of the local community and its customers and to invest in this important sphere.
Donalda Trampa campaign was brought before the court because one of the employees was fired by a shock
New York: Donalda Trampa campaign organizers have been brought before the court because they have not done so by receiving information that their North Cargo Operation Commander has turned his back on an employee when they were driving in one car in February.
This incident was described at the request of the court presented by the court of Charlotte on the third day by Vincent Boroni - former campaign programmer.
Boroni said he's been waiting for months to start an internal review of this case, but the idea is that it won't happen.
Director Árls Filips "takes off the gun, puts his good driver's license on the horse and pointed a stop against Vincent's road," Boroni claims in his complaint.
He also claimed that by submitting a complaint to the local and regional campaign management, Boroni knew that at least four people had experienced the same thing.
"The weapons don't have to rise to cause losses," Boroni wrote in his complaint.
Only two days before the submission of this case, the candidate of the Republican party to the president's office caused a scandal, informing people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners of arms and enthusiasm, could have done so if the election had been won by his chance, Hilaria Clinton and his elected judges.
The representatives of the trampa campaign announced that the media had expressed his words from the context, and he had never been involved in violence.
Borni, with his request, would like to grant compensation from campaign organizers for the adverse surveillance, but from the Philippines - for the use of an attack, an illegal weapon and for the creation of emotional stress.
The representative of the trampa Houpa Hiksa did not comment immediately.
You haven't been able to contact Philips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently launched a campaign.
Nor has it been possible to introduce his consultancy company "Innovative Consulting Services".
The presidential candidate for the Republican Party, Donald Tramps, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - holidays and sports holidays in Čulcie.
On Saturday in July, the first time I was allowed to go to church and sports.
After ten years of worship, Ezra was decided that there would be no more holy ones.
The new page is now split.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in traditional forms and too serious, because, for example, shrubs had to be at the cold end, the frog had to fly, with a man's arm, the "buffling" was not in any Olympic games at all.
However, each participant could show how strong, courageous, practical, and reasonable he is.
After the game, all the leisure activities in the stadium where the pagan festivals began.
At the same time, the "children's strutts" were also working, where the small were able to break through the entrails and get a new picture in the giraffes.
A youth who could also become a tradition was a driver’s license, which involved both tractors and motorcycles.
Inga Kadiòe-Skadinja, director of the former administration of Čulciema, who had chosen a quiet and quiet time, had all spoken things up, however, but it was not able to do much harm.
The celebration continued with the greetings of the newest people in Kulciema.
It's really good that the bastard has added five girls and one girl.
In front of the runners, the most ambitious collection of the Engueres novada - viewers were very pleased with the performance of the old-fashioned "Rudens rhythm", the performance of the different peoples' "Reds" and the performance of the young players "Zelta Pearls".
And it's nothing that happened to a blind eye, too.
Of course, the locals were pleased and happy to have the two famous actors, Janis Jarán and Danis Porgant, who were once again Mildinna Nabina and Scaidrite Krānina, as well as the attractive women of Bárzciema from the fishermen's seat "Diennas".
Balli played Bruggis.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Hitrova.
Hitrova will not only promote well-being and growth in the local regions and London but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, made Hitrove very attractive, just like in 2012 in London, where we contributed to a huge effort to get all the national regions from the Olympic Games .
Stratford and Istenda won a great deal from the Olympics.
And we will do so again by providing local citizens and businesses with business opportunities near the Highway.
In local communities, we will only create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and eventually add a point to the young unemployed in the Hitrove area.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there will be people who will now feel that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hitros is too ambitious.
At the same time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics during the games and that it would be a global catastrophe.
The Sceptics failed in 2012 and will not be fair in the case of Hitrov.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hitrova has been overcome to this day.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrova is an infrastructure project that will benefit the entire society, not individual individuals.
The expansion is possible to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating growth for both employment and experience in this airport and throughout Britain.
In the Hitro, a large team, which has created an investment programme worth 11 billion dollars in infrastructure, including in time and budget, starting with terminal 5, which has been called five years from the spot as the best airport terminal in the world and ending with terminal 2, built between two more intensive flights in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third race, which will be financed by private investment in the amount of 16 billion markets.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure that the same will be the expansion of Hitrov.
It is time to revive the Olympics and expand Hitrov by ensuring our trade prospects and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be pleased.
Lords Paul Deitons is a member of the Hitrova Board and former secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, the woman comes to the palace, trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, the prisoners will find themselves on the hill.
The police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when about four o’clock in the morning, they cross over several cars.
The incident took place on Thursday, shortly after midnight, on the A1 road near the city of Vo Canton in Morges.
The canton police report said that the woman had been trying to commit suicide in an effort to get her to the dark side of the road where several machines had been collected.
Of course, trying to deceive yourself, boys, 49 years of age, collected several machines, including a heavy machine.
She's in the middle of the event.
A number of drivers involved in the accident have already provided evidence, but the other participants have not yet been identified, said the police calling for the drivers involved and the witnesses of the accident.
In this case, a criminal investigation has also been initiated, which is a logical step in this case, to the issue of Le Tribune de Geneve, by Justice Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid confrontation?
Hofstellers adds, "The District Attorney."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last five years show that none of the drivers will be called responsible.
In both cases, during the night, the driver went out to the station, so it was decided that car drivers could not expect to find a passenger, a letter.
Last year, a police officer was sentenced to a robbery after his arrest in August 2014 by a man who was asleep on the A1 road near Paijerne.
The court found that the 22 - year - old victim was drunk and later found himself on the road.
The court concluded that the police officer who was on the road to the accident carried out the situation in a proper manner and the judge admitted that the injured man was "a completely unexpected and extraordinary case".
Anyone who has information about the accident on Thursday is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The Internet collects signatures for the award of a new VID director.
The invitation to tender was opened at the “Avaaz.org” portal to receive signatures from the new Head of State Revenue Service (VID) for the purpose of conducting a tender.
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Green and the Agricultural Union (ZZS) indicates that the company wants a transparent and professional staffing process.
The request was made on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The application by the Director-General of the VID is inconclusive and unprofessional in the process of drawing up the Ingens Collegiate.
This brings to mind the best traditions of the Union's staff.
It discretions state administration and, for the most part, makes society hope for government and politics.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," the letter's petition text.
Its author, Janis B., pointed out that the company did not know the criteria for choosing Koljegova for the topic.
Also, it is not clear what candidates are proposing to work on the VID.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellor should establish a new open tender in which professional candidates are actively interviewed, involve staff experts and offer appropriate remuneration.
Minister of Finance, Dana Reiznieces-Ozola, officially referred to the theme of the College's VID, which was scheduled to be approved by the government this week on the new issue, but all party ministers voted against, so the issue of the week was dismissed.
Samuel: If we lose, then I won the worst.
Pludmal volleyballists Aleksandr Samoilov and Janis Šmēdiņš were waiting for the glorious Riodzejaneiro Olympics, but, unlike them, there is no difference where to conclude competitions after the tournament came out of Samoilov.
One of the world's most powerful football volleyballs in the final and decisive game of the four-day subgroup tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost Brazilians Evandru Gonsalveša Oliveir and Pedro Solbergam Salgada, ending their participation in the most important four-year sports forum.
The three subgroups of Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same was true of two others.
The following three very small points were counted, which after this severe loss was the best for Latvia.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 it also remained at 16 points," the game looked back at Shmedish.
I don't even know how the rest of the set remains without points.
It must not be played.
After that, the second set was in order and the set ended up playing, and it had to be a good basis for the third set as well.
The results are similar, but only one team grows after the parties are reduced.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
All the teams in the subgroup were similar, almost all of them had three seats, so small points were important.
"You had to play more like this, not to give 3-4 points in order," said the athlete.
We knew Evandru could be observed.
"In the first set the same with it at the end, the second row points 1-2, but the third at the +4 he already bought the game," she recalled.
We tried to show the best game.
He's late, he's not late.
The assessment situation before the trial was not seen, but it was known that more small points were needed as far as possible.
"If we lose, then I won the worst," said Samuel.
From Evandru we looked forward to a good service, and with it at the first sessions, it was quite good at the end, but the third time he opened the service and found it difficult to produce an attack.
At the same time, I made many mistakes directly to the Pedru service, but this was to end.
Samuel told us that today’s sportsmen were not nervous about their past.
"We also had protection, but we needed better service," said the athlete.
"They played well and finally got to the Urra."
Before the tournament, they had already said that the explosion was the worst that could have been.
We had a chance to fight for the first place, but we were not even out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for medals and we were also from ourselves, but then there was no more difference - 25 place or fourth place," said Samuelov, who predicted that the gift would continue to play together in the future as well.
I think that the issue will not be and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samuel Riodezáneiro had already been in the third Olympic career, as he started with Martin Flövin in Beijing in 2008 but played with Ruslan Sorokin in London four years ago.
This was the second start in the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" also follows the process of opening the gas market from the potential market position.
The national energy company "Latvenergo" followed the process of opening gas markets both from consumer and potential traders' positions, said Ivita Bidere, secretary of the company's press.
"The decision on whether, in the future, the "Latvenergo" gas market will also be accompanied by a trader will determine which gas market model and legal regulation will be established."
"Therefore, we are actively involved in the establishment and commenting of legislative acts on our part, as well as in making our proposals," Bidere said.
The Agency has already written that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Commission for Public Services Regulation and the Energy Company of Latvia, has developed a draft regulation of the Ministry of Natural Gas Trade and Use, which will change the principles of the natural gas market from 3 April 2017, ensuring that natural gas users have the right to freely select natural gas traders.
In developing a new natural gas market regulation, the EM aims to make the natural gas trade process as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service option, the "marketer's central model" has been selected, in which the trader ensures all of the activities related to customer service - one contract, one account and one place of information and customer service, by leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
As we recall that the gradual opening of the market for domestic users - also after 3 April 2017 for domestic users who do not wish to select another natural gas marketer - will continue to receive natural gas from the existing market for regulated prices, thus becoming related users.
"In such a case, the obligation to provide natural gas-related users for regulated prices is laid down by the public trader," he informed the ministry.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, a natural gas trader shall ensure that the original natural gas trader has a fixed price for a certain period of time.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers discuss the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and user.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply and suspension of natural gas to users, the safety requirements of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the operator of the system, the rights and obligations of the owner of the natural gas supply and the use of natural gas; the arrangements to be made for the provision of the services received, the percentage of interruptions, the trader exchange arrangements and the supply of natural gas to the users concerned; and the procedure whereby the supply of natural gas is provided by the public trader.

The following week, the Minister of Finance, Dana Reiznice-Ozola (ZZS), plans to speak with Prime Minister Mauri Kučinski (ZZS) and government coalition partners about the increase in the remuneration of the State Revenue Service (VID).
On Friday, Journalists said that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Director-General for the VID should be addressed urgently in order to make this matter more attractive to the applicants of the reintroverted competition.
The following week, we will also talk about the change in the terms of the tender.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think of any specific candidate to be called upon to appeal to the evening session.
At the same time, Reiznice-Ozola expressed the view that the Director-General of the State Environment Service, Inga Koljegova, would be a good VID Director-General.
On the other hand, with regard to the current VID manager's duties, Daci Peléko, who has shown willingness to appeal to this issue, the Minister reiterates the view that the new VID Director-General should be "seen from the dust" and should not come from the VID structure.

It is also reported that the former Director General of the VID was leaving office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; increasing the price of beer in the United States and Europe, as well as the value of US dollar.
In the world, oil prices continue to increase on Friday morning, with the positive impact of investors' savings on the statements by Saudi Arabia's Minister of Oil Affairs, which strengthens the hope that the largest oil recipient countries will take action at the upcoming OPEC meeting in September to stabilize the global oil market.
On Thursday, the three main United States beer index reached a record level which had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the increase in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The increase in oil prices and a strong number of companies' financial indicators were also the reason for the increase in European beer index.
The US dollar will increase on Thursday for the euro, for the UK and for Japan's yen.
In New York’s electronic trade market, the WTI brand of raw oil supplies increased by $1.78 to $44,49 per barrel on Thursday.

The sales of the preserver "The Green Lacona" are only low by 33.8%.
The sales of the preserver's Green Law was only EUR 4,202 million, which is 33.8% less than years ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - up to EUR 904.7 thousand, shows the annual financial report published by Lursoft on the basis of data.
The company’s management report states that in 2015 the company was working with losses incurred for several reasons, including in the context of the ongoing lack of turnover resulting from the withdrawal of the Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by interrupting the existing credit line and leaving the Zilo Lajuna with concluded contracts unimplemented.
Thus, the company did not have sufficient means to purchase more expensive raw materials in large quantities and to obtain a discharge.
The withdrawal of the bank concerned from the Latvian market also led the company to implement projects supporting the European Union Structural Funds, which would make it possible to buy new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
In addition, the financial factors of the company had a negative impact on the increase in the price of raw materials in the year under review and on the absence of customers to pay more than the product produced by the company.
"Only on the second half of July 2016 did customers recognize price changes and were ready to buy goods for new - higher - prices," the company’s manager said.
In 2015, the Green Layer also started discussions with potential investors, including the assessment of the company’s movements and non-movable assets.
Investors have already been at the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the activities and development of the company had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan for 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, enabling greater production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment has been purchased that ensures a higher speed of production," the company’s manager said.
The management of the "Brussels Ship" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company to carry out orders which were not yet possible.
The first production party to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the supply protocol for the sale of the product has already been signed, all products will be sold in accordance with the supply protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by around EUR 300 000 per month," the company’s management said.
In August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish production to Iraq.
In 2016, the Green Law has sent the first experimental container to Israel, extending the market to Cyprus and this year will sign a cooperation agreement with the new United States of America.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, the Green Layer worked with EUR 6,347 million and EUR 5,113 million.
"Brussels" was created in 1997 and its main capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two private persons in Latvia - Mihallam Kaidanova (89.11%) and Igor Širšona (10.89%).
Steps were invited by 15 p.m. to wait for Zár Lenderi at the museum and participate in the press conference.
The Christmas can be viewed as the beginning of the career of the goddess Zára Lenderer’s career and the city of inspiration.
In 1924, Zára Lender’s passion for the cross-sectional Ruth, who was a Swedish missionary in Latvia, was considered legitimate because she immediately discovered to Záras Lender's wife an unusual low contrast, which she tried to delve into the theater of Riga.
It may have been an unheard of sense of humor in Riga, becoming a legitimate guide in the creative course of Sarah against the world’s fame.
Rīga Zárai Leanderrei was bound with warm memories, and she was looking forward to returning to the streets of Riga, but unfortunately these hopes were not met because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the exhibition, this meeting will be possible at Riga Christmas 2016 and will take place in the magnificent Ieva Kerēvica in the beautiful role of Zára Leder.

Kurdus activists are taking over the building of the German public radio organisation.
On Thursday evening, a large group of people took up the WDR building in Diseldorf, where they held an action for almost two hours for a long protest, reports the German police.
The demonstrators, who came along with the plates taken together, slammed various holes, trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Amateur reports that the demonstration has resulted in a total of peace and protestors at the end of the employee's request have voluntarily left the building.
The insurance undertaking shall pay compensation to air passengers on the third day of the flight.
If the insurance has paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday, on 10 August, Riga Airport cancelled a flight which resulted in a visit to the music festival.
On 11 August, an application for compensation was received from a client in If Insurance.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible for the third day due to the airport's cancellation, the customer was calculated for the reservation of accommodation that could no longer be cancelled and for the tickets purchased at EUR 204.
On the other hand, customers of money spent on car tickets have promised to pay the airline.
If the insurance of all travel insurance benefits averages 15% has paid compensation for the suspension or cancellation of the travel.
"In these cases expenses are compensated for the purchase, payment or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of lodging of the home," says Dagnia Rutka, director of the insurance product.
As we know, on August 10th, due to the technical problems of Riga Airport, the private aircraft stopped, so only several flights were cancelled, but several flights were made to other airports.
Because of the family repair, a man goes to the crowded streets and is forced to leave the house.
In the case of "4.study", Dmitry Saidjašev, a neighbor who started to repair capital in his apartment, and since then Dmitri has suffered from a heart attack and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors did volunteer construction and my apartment was damaged.
Then I informed the Riga Building Board, the House Manager and other organizations.
The government said that we are not any operational service and that we have no expert.
"The owner of a dwelling has to go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from the possession," says Dmitry.
The inspired expert came out, confirmed what had happened, and realized that the excess was in a state of disillusionment.
However, since the first month of Dmitry’s presentation, it has been in the building, and by the beginning of this week, it has not been able to tell anyone whether it is safe to find a place to live.
The building manager said - that's the rule, wait if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in order.
"Then I wrote to Riga's mind, but they sent it to the house manager, then the house manager went back to the building, and then he's on his way," says Dmitry.
After considering all the papers, it is clear that the building work has been stopped, however soon it can be heard that someone is working there.
For another two months, an experiment must be carried out and for six months the resident's owner who is doing repair work must avoid all these deficiencies.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the building is considered to be incomplete and excessive.
The expert has not indicated whether there is a damage to the metal regime in this recent construction, so there is no doubt that the owner of the lower dwelling is at risk.
"That is why we have requested further clarification from this expert," says Ilze Züka, representative of Riga City's city building.
Despite the ban on any repair work in the upper room, it is still heard that the building continues.
The fine for voluntary construction without construction permits is from EUR 70 to EUR 700, but in a particular case, the penalty may be significantly lower.
While the expert opinion is expected, the building government has decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in the building and in the Dmitry apartment.
"This is not a case in the construction practice when, in this way, because of their lack of knowledge or simply lack of desire, the people may have created a threat not only to their own property but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result this owner cannot operate his property," says the representative of the building.
Now Dmitria remains looking for another place to live — with radios, friends, hotels, or even renting other rooms.
But the losses caused by Dmitry can try to get away from a neighbor’s civil justice system, which can take a lot of time.
Because of the massive construction, living in both houses is now prohibited until the builder brings his lock, and it can be expected for three weeks.
The losses incurred will have to be borne by the owner of the dwelling in which the repair has occurred.
Because the owner of this apartment has not taken into account the fact that the building has not been taken into account, he may also be in danger of suffering for a period of up to six months.
Take it!
How much do I have in this picture?
The perfect answer - five.
In Ukraine, at Demidova’s zoo near Kiev, five white farmers were born.

The former Chemmer sanatorium will cost EUR 22 million for five-year-old hotels.
The former Chemera Sanatorium for the Park Hotel Čemeri will pay 22 million euros, and the agency will report to the senior hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Čemeri" by Gita Želve.
The establishment of a hotel is the first phase of the restoration of the former Sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or a well-being clinic, planned to open in 2022, until the hotel opening is scheduled for May 2018.
Gelve notes that the cost of accurate clinics is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be found in the former Kemer Tower polyline building, which is approximately 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located in three locations.
Park Hotel Čemeri and the proposed clinic owner is an international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of "G Capital Europe" are several investors who invest money in this fund, says Želve.
As the Executive Director of G Capital Europe said earlier, George Jones planned to invest between 12 and 15 million euros in the construction of the former framework polyline, with a total investment of more than 30 million euros.
It has already been reported that in the restoration of the cultural park more than 42 hectares, the restoration of roads and railways, the construction of an interactive nature tourism facility, the repair of the territory and the construction of the parking lot in the Emir Darzina street, which will contribute to the social development and growth of the city of Jūrmala, the Jujuma Council plans to attract EUR 14.5 million from the funds of the European Union, co-financed with three to four million euros.
The design work scheduled for mid-2017 will start in the next autumn of 2017, but construction and planning work will begin.
As reported, in the historical sanatorium complex, "Kemeri" is planned to create a five-hour hotel "Park Hotel Čemeri" and "wellness" or a well-being clinic.
However, the reconstruction is slow.
In addition, the 2010 review also claimed that "Ominais" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", who continues to provide daily technical control in the "Kemeri" sanatorium, and in 2011 it is certain that "the final reconstruction of the existing hotels "Kemeri" will be completed" and immediately start preparations for the opening of the Kempinski chain.
In October 2014, his willingness to purchase a collection of Chemér's goods belonging to the payable "Ominais Latvia" confirmed the "Park Hotel Čemeri" in an island, but months later the island was recognized as unticky because the winner had not paid for the purchase at a time.
The sales price was determined according to the initial price of the last unlisted island - EUR 2.86 million.
As the agency informed the representative of the City Council of Ieva Aile, the municipality, by signing a protocol, has demonstrated that, with the support of the European Union Structural Funds co-financed infrastructure in the complex - a refurbishment of the historical Kemer Park, an interactive nature tourism facility, a complex road and a parking lot.

Former NATO Commander Bridlov's e-mail was heard by Russian hackers.
Hacker, who praised the U.S. National Committee of Democrats (DNC) computers, probably committed several other cyberattacks, also heard from former NATO commander Filipa Brídlova e-mail and George Sorosa's "Open Society" servers, sent the business agency "Bloomberg" on Thursday.
Hackeri published information on DCLeaks.com.
The list and information on the work of the Sorosa Institute are also included there.
The hacker Institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers with Russian spies who listened to DNA e-mails.
The paper "The Wall Street Journal" reports that the U.S. Department of Administration Baraka Obama is currently considering the issue of new sanctions for Russia in response to the downsizing of DNA computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to accuse the democratic party's servers of hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities in official cybercrime.
As reported, the website WikiLeaks published about 20,000 e-mails received from the DNC computer system and of which it is understood that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the party's candidates, Hilaria Clinton, former Chancellor of Vermont, in the fight against democratic nominations.
As reported by the US press, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts a survey of democracies, as well as other U.S. experts, believes that Russia's commitment to cybercrime is beyond doubt.
Makartnij: Joko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Makartnius realized that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of the threat of the legendary group "The Beatles".
At 74 years of age, an old velvet still maintains a "bad" relationship with the late John Lenona, but when he gave his group a list of entries in the study, Makartnia asked him because Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harison, Ringo Star, Lenona and Makartnia - between.
When the singer asked about the two relationships, he said to Rolling Stone magazine, "That's really good."
We're still in danger.
As soon as we entered, she sat on the strengthening floor.
Most groups could not cope with it.
We were able, but not quite successful, because we were very upset.
We were not afraid of sexists, but the girls usually didn't come to the recording studio, so she let us work.
When John began to meet Joko, she did not sit in the control room, but both of us.
The author of the "Yellow Submarine" also realized that he now regularly contacted the former group members Ringo, and at any time confirmed the work plans of the "Apple" study, but otherwise "The Beatles" is "end to work".
The question of whether he was still in touch with the other member of the legendary rock group, Makartney said in Rolling Stone, "Very not."
We will be content in social activities and dances.
But I don't even go to meetings, but I feel a lot more than that.
I got out of Apple during the heavy break.
In my place at the meetings, I sent John Eastman and said, "Please tell me what everyone says, because I can't take a seat on the table."
It was too painful to see her family dead.
The company now works because I'm just going to listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venezuela has ever been a viable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venezuela has once been a viable planet.
NASA Godarda Space Research Institute has developed models to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that also use climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the surface of Venus is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon that has ever been the same conditions as Earth.
Scientists have previously made comments that the slow pace of Venezuela’s movement is explained by the blue atmosphere.
However, recent simulations indicate that a plan was once planned for Venus, similar to that of the Earth, and it was rapidly changing.
The model is also looking at the old Venezuelan topography.
The planet had more dry areas than on Earth, but it had plenty of water and geographical diversity in order to create life and not allow to drain water.
In the morning of Friday, Saule was 30 percent more active.
In the GISS model simulation, the Venezuelan model of movement reveals that part of the day light on it lasted for 2 months, the press release explained to GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes a thing that, in turn, forms a fear of the stars, which acts as a liturgy, protecting the planet from Saul’s heat.
As a result, a measure of climate is created, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model of the story of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution, which scientists have developed in their hypotheses.
Although it was once alive, for several billions of years, Venera had been subjected to too much anger and ultraviolet radiation.
Its ocean was destroyed, and the hurricanes had caused ultraviolet fires.
With the water completely made, only the planet’s carbon dioxide atmosphere remained with the deadly greenhouse gas - Venezuela, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venezuelan climate model in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Rojs withdraws from the "Avalanche" trainer's apartment
The fourth day of Colorado's "Avalanche" trainer and hockey operations vice-president Patrick Rojs asked for the reasons why there was insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
The vice president of Colorado and General Joe Sakik confirmed this message and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new trainer.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, cautious and objectively fulfilling my duties as chief coach and vice-president of the Kolorada club hockey operation," Rojs, aged 50, wrote in his report.
During this evening, I have a lot of thought about how I could improve the team's performance in order to provide it with the necessary savings and achieve the higher levels.
To achieve this, the vice-president's views of the main trainer and hockey operations must be fully aligned with the views of the organisation.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to the delivery of the team.
These conditions have not been fulfilled at this time.
The speaker, who won Russia on 23 May 2013, thanked the Council for its contribution to the team.
He said that Patrick had informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and want him to do the best he has ever done.
In his first season with the "Avalanche" team 2013-2014, Roys was recognized as the best trainer in the league and received the rank of Jack Adams.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in Central Division, but the first round of the Kolorado team won the Minnesota hockeys. Since then, the club has not joined the closing games for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the "Wild" team without a second special invitation from Western Conference organizers.
The famous physician Rojs cut out four Stelli's shoes in his career - two with Montreal "Canadian" and two with "Avalanche".
Operators of the North Sea oil platform resume negotiations and stay on the line

It was pointed out that their recent measures, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were aimed at 30 per cent of the planned wage reduction.
The negative market pressure of the Wood Group has reduced wages to 9 per cent of North Sea workers this year.
In 2014, the company had already reduced the wages of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company makes it clear that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive market discounts.
In contrast, Shell has already reduced wages for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its work by preparing a large-scale merger with the UK Energy Group.
Energy companies feel pressureing oil prices, and the situation is becoming increasingly difficult for the UK to move to the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Mr Davis Andersons, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with the representatives of workers to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea Strip Plans.
He said that North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he made it clear that the North Sea and the country in general need an economy from which all are benefiting, not individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are planned to invest almost $1.4 billion compared with $7 billion, which have been invested in the last five years.
Kepler measured the speed of the star movement in Plejades.
The most recent Kepler Telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of speeding stars in Plejades.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in this star come at different speeds, as well as how the speed of constellations relates to the design of the planet.
"We wish to compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the bond between stars mass, age and even the history of their solar system," authored Pasadenas Caltech Infrasarkano Process and Analytical Center scientist Luis Rebula.
The star of the moon is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are just beginning to grow at about 125 million years of age.
They cross at maximum speed.
With maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large number of star winds.
In the wind, moving stars in the magnetic field, they break the stars.
As the stars grow, their movement rate decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's movement by setting the time between the known star area, e.g. the display of the sun's plane.
The latest speeding directory of stars shows that larger stars are faster than smaller stars.
Rebul is compared to the stars with the giants, higher growers do piroutes rather than small growers.
The Rebuls tells us that the Plejades "balette" is seen as the slowing objects are larger and smaller, while the faster the rotational objects are very small stars.
Because the Pleiades star is so close, it serves as a large space laboratory where stars can be compared to moving speeds.
Rebuls reports that Plejades' star helps build theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for the older and the younger stars.
We still have much to learn about when and why the speed of rising stars has changed and about their complete stopping process.
The Rebuls and his colleagues detailedly identified the speedy analysis of the Pleiades constellations in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
