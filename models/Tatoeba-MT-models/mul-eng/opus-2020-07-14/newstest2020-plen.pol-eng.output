Joseph Witko's father: I saw Jesus in a white shirt
He's a charismatic.
On his right hand, the smell of release and healing are rooted in the dust.
He was a few hundred years old when things went wrong in his life.
Today, by means of the French, they've experienced this in others.
On the right by O. Witko my swiss about release and healing lead the lungs
A 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm heart rate was once approached by his parents.
It's supposed to be broken.
Joseph’s father, Witko, prayed about him.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital for execution.
“Operation is not necessary, ” said the doctor in mind, “and the residence is less than 1.5 mm”.
My parents cried happily.
After the next prayer, the French diurea disappeared completely.
The Creator’s extraordinary spiritual activities began to take on a new role as an adult.
In dreams, pure souls came to him asking for help.
I was built in the night and brought to prayer for the dead and those who died at the time – remember.
He also experienced the presence of a wicked spirit.
And he had a vision of what's going on with a man who's gonna commit death.
“My body began to change.
I lost my human senses and started to get the look of animals," he says.
The invisible force pushed him up, couldn't get his voice out of him.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him a rat.
"Disserted in the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the saints, I was released and returned to human status..." he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these wonderful experiences.
There was a call in it.
He was 16 when he joined the French.
In the sermons, he did not just want to tell us about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Chariot Community of the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on the removal of the disease are involved in the healing of the sick that their father, Witko, is doing.
However, spirituality emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual health, not physical.
First pass Colpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) the Colpinga FRAC team has earned its current master, Polski Dartom Bogorii Grodzisk Mazowicki, in the 3rd wheel of the LOTTO Supergli Tenis Table.
Larosławing in such a personal setting that they presented with the guards had no chance of winning with the sovereign leagues.
He showed this one with Dart Bogoria.
He's still missing the team's leader, Chen Jingqi.
It may be with him in the ironing system after the third of the triumf series in the new season.
Young Azjata Qiyao Han seems to have not yet grown to win with such drums as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Paul Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most prospective Poles, or Mark Badowski.
The leader of Hellady was the largest star in the Mosir Hall at the Sikorski ul in Jaroslavi.
As old as Qiao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class for themselves.
After three units, Kolping FRAC conducted 2:1.
So Lei must have bought Mark Badowski, and Daniel Gorak after an emotional, five-year-old battle – Paul Sirucka.
Then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lee a chance.
There may have been more hope of winning at two points, but Qiyao Han didn't leave Badoski.
There won't be additional studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafała Triskowski's findings, free pro-professional research programmes for 70 and 80-year-olds were to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it did not receive the approval of the Ministry of Health and was subject to the Agency for the Protection of Health Technology and Customs.
The agency reasoned that the target group had been badly damaged.
“Continued actions may result in the detection of specific disease units, which may contribute to greater difficulty in accessing NFZ evidence and negatively affect the patient by causing anxiety and discomfort related to the false positive outcome of the studies”, it was written.
The decision of the resort does not understand the president of the chair.
“The money is ours, the money we have foreseen.
Only the government is afraid that if people are tested, they will later go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is just about to lead to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to strengthening the health system, because it helps in rapid detection of disease and in a healthy approach to health.
The court here has a very strange position that I don't understand," said Rafał Trsakowski.
"It's hard for me to imagine that white specialists say, 'We're not afraid, because they'll be longer doctors, and if such specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised that there's health service in this state," the PO policy added.
Palestine Responsive to Israel: We will conclude all the existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the United Nations General Assembly that all agreements would be concluded with Israel if the incoming Government of the country is trying to comply with Benjamin Netanjahu's promise of an annex to the occupied Palestinian countries.
"If the Government of Israel comes to the realization of this plan, we will strengthen all the signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made," he said.
"We reject the whole and complete plan," he threatened with Nazi Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights through any possible means – a little important, which will be the result – by engaging fully in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Autonomy, who made similar statements in July.
Netanyah, the current Prime Minister of Israel, has again received a government-building mission on 17 September following the elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if the win was won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jews in Israel throughout the West Bank.
At the beginning of the 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that were governed by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to conduct the United Nations General Assembly in the Palestinian countries of general elections.
The last one was in 2006.
"After my return to the country, I called on the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared.
Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the UN, to benefit from the rights of “the full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions”.
The Palestinian leader concluded the call to the international community to “require Israel to comply fully with the provisions of the United Nations”.
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "will join the UN in the efforts of Palestinian Autonomy against Israel rather than fight against terrorist attacks in Autonomy under his leadership".
Danon, as the agencies refer to, however, did not link to Netanyah’s alleged anaks of Palestinian countries.
Ratists want defibrillators at the neo-algic points of the industry
History from the border crossing shows that an AED automatic defibrillator can save human lives.
The leader of the Ratunko Station in the industry wants such equipment to be found in the neural points of the city.
The officials received free diplomas from the Vjevodzka Station for the preparation of the Council of Industry.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, former Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are the staff of the Skarbowe Task Force in Industry.
On 28 August they filled out a service at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medice. The function of the Celno-Skarbowei Service noticed a man lying in the field of fishing.
The Chinese activist died in the arrest of torture.
He wanted to benefit from the rights guaranteed by the constitution
To Cao Shouxia, a wife of the activists, a Communist party secretary called on 23 September from her family village to inform her that the husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
The cause of death has not been revealed.
At Cao's bones, she saw the body of a masquerade, not to be recognized.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," said the woman.
"They didn't let me take the phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police forced her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of “a tragic accident. ”
105 million zł for company from industry video game from the National Centre for Research and Development
Nearly 105 million of the cost of financing the company from the gambling industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced in the fifth edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there were, inter alia, the development of platforms for the development of field games based on the AR game engine, which creates a real world map with an application that enables users to send data; a test-training platform to verify practical skills to work and improve professional skills using VR and AI technology; an innovative game that simulates the management of real production processes using a new model based on world-wide virtual interaction with the real use of the world's economy with the use of the NCR industry's 4.
The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of producers of video games on the global market by 2023.
As NCBR gives, today the Polish sector plays video growing at 10% annually.
According to government data the value of the Polish market video game in 2016 resulted in 1.85 billion evil, and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"A specially prepared GameINN research agenda with 300 million evil support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme is an important incentive for further dynamic growth in the Polish game," we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as B+R, competence upgrade programmes, IP box or support programmes carried out by NCBR, stimulate innovation activities and enable them to more effectively reciprocate into a highly competitive market," the Vice-President, Minister of Science and Education of higher Jarosław Gowin quoted in the Communication.
The director of the Research Centre notes that innovation money not only leads to innovatives in the form of project financing, but also remains in their bids – three-fourths of the company’s use in B+R in 2018 than a year earlier.
‘The estimated costs of B+R activities amounted to 1.7 billion gross, which resulted in over 300 million losses for companies benefiting from this period.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three GameINN editions," the Vice-President stressed.
Director NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamienecki also recalled that in the two previous competitions, more than 211.2 million new projects were awarded a total of 78 new projects.
The great interest in competition III and the diversity of the proposals made shows that the video game industry has ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitiveness.
“It is particularly comforting to know that, as in previous editions, there are projects on solutions that are not only solutions but also related to industry 4.0”, he adds.
In the third competition, GameINN on financing of even 20 million evils could be attributed to entrepreneurs, associations of entrepreneurs and associations of companies with scientific units.
The NCBR reached 87 applications for a total amount of funding of approximately 317 million gross.
The tendering budget at the time of the tender was 100 million, but it was increased, resulting in almost 105 million funding for 27 projects.
Detailed information on the results of the GameINN competition is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Operational Intelligent Development Programme.
The NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of the companies associated with the Polish Games Agreement, including companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloomer Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga has committed to stealing the castle Kaspera Dolberga
It was September 16th.
Dolberg, who at the end of August, met Ajaks Amsterdam to Nice, was excited to learn that he had disappeared from the devil.
They weren't, because they're worth 70 thousand euros.
The next day, the great Danishs did not appear on the stakes, translating the problems of the ice.
The issue has been urgent since the beginning.
The pilots in the tent have private safes, and the club field is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, the theft was committed at the end of Diaby-Fadig.
18 years ago he asked Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieir.
He also promised Duncy to return the money for the sugar.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most prospective young generation pilots in France.
He went to Nicei as a 30-year-old in order to get into the first group three years later.
He got up in the seventh game this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the L'Equipe newspaper put it, the club is likely to expand it with immediate effect.
In the event, he initiated a disciplinary action against his employer.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
Check if you're sure you're doing well.
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before lunch).
But not everyone knows that to actually avoid injuries, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now when serious infections occur.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our lungs
And most of us are short-lived!
It is not true that it must be antibacterial (a lot of doctors are aware of it).
By saying, we're not only the lower and the left, but also: the end of the thumbs (connected or single) – run them with the spindles inside the second hand, the space between the thumbs (repay your hand, cutting your finger on yourself), the girls – we're going to cover each other's hand and we're going to cut it to the right and left in this way.
In case of accident (when you cannot wash your hands) you should lose your blood sugar and then use your antibacterial (drugs, 5-drug).
The use of public toilets does not affect the hands of the cramp or the door (the recommendation of the Central Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it up by the paperman.
Iran's president says he's rejected the U.S. negotiation proposal, Donald Trump refuses.
Teheran did not negotiate with the US during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the US's offer to eliminate sanctions – said Iran's fifth President Hasan Rowhani.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian side requested the removal of restrictions that he did not agree with.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhanie, the Americans have proposed to remove all sanctions imposed on Tehran in order to negotiate a new international agreement.
It should regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and the program for the construction of ballistic stamps.
Rowhani: Iran will not talk in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said he did not agree to these discussions on the topic of “toxic atmosphere”.
He said he met American diplomats because he was in his home of France, Germany, and Great Britain.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not engage in the "maximum pressure" atmosphere.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1, no one is able to predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhan said.
Earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not exclude negotiations with the United States, and the European nuclear agreement imposed an American sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the entry into force of the U.S. nuclear agreement "are conditions which do not allow" dialogue.
If we can get rid of this condition in the first place and if America gets a penalty and a maximum pressure, then we can talk to America – he said.
He added that he did not exclude the meeting with the President of the United States Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a conversation in the mid-week meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
Trip: "Ian asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian side.
"Iran wanted me to remove the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said "no!" the President of the United States was pleased.
Injection with an atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and Great Britain are trying to adjust the pressure between Washington and Tehran in some way to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which were signalists.
It concluded that, in order to eliminate the economic sanctions, Iran would withdraw from the nuclear weapons-building programme and the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the signing of the agreement in May 2015, her signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
Well, it didn't work out.
Washington uses the tactic of eliminating the maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include full embargo on Iranian robbery.
Tehran said that if he did not receive permission to export the raw material, he would limit his obligations resulting from the agreement for 60 days.

The judge of the Vojevodzki Administrative Court in Warsaw and Emilie's husband, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the arrest of the judges, was returned to the environment to be condemned by the NSA.
Reason: There was no early disciplinary action against him and therefore there is no basis for supporting the WSA Wjciech Mazur's device to withdraw it from its duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a prosecutor at the NSA, initiated an explanation procedure at the end of August, but it was not translated into the course of the proceedings against him.
Despite the fact that the NSA, in such cases acting as a disciplinary judge, has to make a decision by the WSA president within a month of its release.
In this case, a judge who has publicly informed his wife of the psychological problems in order to persuade her, who has been removed from the KRS office because of the suspicions of participation in the hierarchical group, will return to the cause and will be released on behalf of the Polish Red Cross.
Judge Zmidt refuses to participate in the Heiter Group.
He claims that there is no evidence to support this, except for his wife's words and her words.
That's exactly what the other judges said about the "Cast": they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's possible that they're on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't pull the trigger to protect evidence from their electronic carriers, he also smiles on the content of the phone Emilia Szmidt, who kept the phone in a red in another case.
The police did not pull the trigger to secure the equipment of persons who were escorted by Judge Waldemar Zurek.
There's no evidence - there's no Smyd's case, there's no Kasty's case.
There is also no case for the chief of the NIK Mariana Banasia for renting a concierge and concealing revenue.
CBA's checking his property statements.
And check when it's checked.
However, the Commission does not take action on the ethics of the Polish Banasim because Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has come together to take a decisive decision on the withdrawal of the substitutes of Banas and to call as a lawyer, although the right of such an amazing combination does not provide for).
The whole reminds me of a movie novel, an American mistake, about how the wife comes home and stops a man with a couch in his bed.
He's so excited and excited that he can't say a word.
She's standing in the door, and at this time, she's getting out of bed, she's crying, and she's coming out.
And the men took the bed.
When the wife withdraws her voice and cries: What is that?
Who's this woman?
The man asks, "What woman is she, love?"
It's just that either "Kasty" or "Banasia" is about the state family.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final step above
Formerly returning to the rivivalization of the Maternal Corps, a massive medalist of the world's passions from London 2017, first tried 1,85 and 1,89 and second 1,92.
1.94 was able to achieve it in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the end, I will have to jump more technically," she admitted before the camera of Eurosport Lithuania.
In the eliminations, American Vast Cunningham and Bijölorusinka Karyn Demidik – 1,94.

Cornel Moraviecki lives in a hospital in a difficult state
He went to the hospital, and the doctors of his apartment find his condition difficult.
I need to add that he's smart and aware.
"We believe it will come out that it will win the next time.
We all pray for him to return to health," said an anonymous close friend of Cornel Moravia in a conversation with the Super Express Journalists.
In the upcoming elections, the father of the Prime Minister is running to the Senate.
"I have the closest family and politics in my life," said Cornel Morawick in a report that he gave two weeks ago to the newspaper "Super Express".
In January, “Super Express” reported that the 78-year-old Cornel Moraviecki was on trial at the War Hospital in Wrocław.
“There were strange, disturbing symptoms in me, and I reported to the hospital.
It's been like I've got a necklace.
But the worst was before me.
When a computer tomography study was conducted, it was found that I had a new set of skills...," the father of the prime minister told him.
A few days later, in the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw, Cornel Moraviecki went through a serious operation.
As Moravieck told me, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal captain, King Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and went mentally.
“I know that many people have prayed for me for what I am very grateful for.
Luckily, I don't have any more breaks.
I don't know if I'm going to go through chemotherapy.
I'm giving myself to doctors of specialists who are more reasonable in their thinking.
I have to go back to some state of utility after this difficult operation.
I hope everything will be all right," said Colonel Moraviecki in January in a conversation with "SE".
"If I'd done the test later, it would be tragic and I'd already been down with it..." he added.
Kraków: 14-year-old dead
The local police commanders in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Neil Stollos.
Anyone who has any information about the deceased is allowed to contact.
The missing 26 September evening came from the place of residence, and she did not return or contact her relatives until now.
Last time he was seen at the ul old Guesthouse in Krakow.
Nel Stollosa is 14 years old, weighs 167 cm, has blond hair and scarve eyes.
When she was last seen, she was wrapped in blue, crazy under and boots.
Any person who has any information about the deceased shall contact the police under tel. 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
It's a wave of ol' jumps.
The title of the relationship between amateur sports events held on Sunday Sunday, September 15th at the Oleandry Street in Oláwi, may be for some of the poets.
I'm on my way to the real road, because I'm far away, but that's what I'm saying.
The competition for jumps is often the result of higher obstacles, which, in the most prestigious international professions, exceed even two metres.
It is worth adding that the long and still deadly record of the world, established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibele, on the horse “huaso”, is 247 cm.
So high in Olava, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazonation at level 135 cm also to the worst should not...
The works organized by unskilled Jan Seenkiewicza and other JKS "In the Sea," were a show part of the previously published "The Heavy Shipwrecks", which we will write in this issue on page 22.
There were eight amazones that trained driving in the JKS.
Four of them competed in horses, and four were on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szóldra was the best writing, documenting the crazy "Sprinter".
The small, but as the dynamic space began to break the gap of 40 cm high, and ended just when it was stopped with a top white distance of 125 cm from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily, and only after three further refusals were rejected by the competition jury from further fiberation.
The second place in the kisses was Amelia Pavlak, dating "Fami", and the third of Lena Boruń on "Harmiderze".
She was also fighting the youngest tour participant - Inga Aksman, a galloping and kicking by the obstacles on the little "Carmen" button.
More emotions have joined the beginners and I see during the competition with large horses.
The dangerous sights were Paulina Szewczyk, documenting "Declaration" and the Anastasis Abramenko, which went to "Lotce".
Fortunately, there was nothing wrong with the horses, except the small amazons or the Amazons, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A number of problems with the introduction of the young "Wineta" at the park were bringing her to Veronica Luckiewicz.
There was a need for an ass trainer, or another horse to a pair of whom she was wearing a bit of the "Wineta."
After the crackdown from the park, she also had a full voice, so for a few moments in the boxes and on the floor was dangerous. "It's all under control!" Jan Seenkiewicz calmed down a little bit, especially the young ones.
From the beginning of the competition, great horses were well recorded on the park by Marta Massalska, who received a beautiful "Whiskey".
This suitable key, in pairs with experienced Amazonian, followed by the second approach in the final phase as first crossed 135 cm and was the best result at this time.
However, the same height was also Paulina Szewzyk on "Declaration", Wernik Łukkiewicz on "Wine" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotce".
So, to the decoration of the floor and the reception of the prizes as a vehicle, all these runners went together, and finally, together with the Amazons on the kitchens in Radecki's March, they performed an effective round of honor, ending with these interesting and exciting professions.
Thank you.
The sports club "In Siodle" warmly thanks the competition sponsor for the jump power during the XVI "Technical Sports": Oval City Office, Water Station and Canalization in Oławi, Rewiatwe Age and the company "Mustang".
Max Colonko is from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Colonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Colonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation of #R Revolution Mariusza Maxa Colonki was to attend the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution led its proposal, in particular, to young right-wing voters.
Before the Colonko elections, he ordered collaboration with Mark Jacubiaki or Paul Kukis, but none of these coalitions were reached, and the KWW of the Patriotic Revolution Maxa Colonko was unable to even collect enough signatures to display lists in any polling area in Poland.
Now Colonko reported on Twitter that he ended up working with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Colonko.
"I'll wait for KWW to define my name by name.
Please accept my contact with the mentioned entity," he added, adding that more information will be provided shortly.
In the event it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work, whether it is the end of the formation of the #R Revolution.
On 4 July, in the United States of America's Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Colonko reported on the establishment of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has resigned from the YouTube portal of Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
“We have plenty of politics, enough of your tough games, enough of your amateur governments.
It's time for the government to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation," Colonko said.
In the programme, the parties found, inter alia, issues relating to the judiciary (should be selected in the general elections), tax changes (equivalent to the free amount of tax for all), military repairs (in the form of military assistance for NATO countries of the east, with particular regard to Poland), referendums on possession of weapons, restrictions on the number of posts or the introduction of single electoral circuits.
A few days after the announcement of the establishment of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined in negotiations with Mark Jacubaiaki.
At the end of July, Kolonko placed on his profile in social media information suggesting that #R will connect forces with the Kukiz River 15.
However, none of these coalitions finally arrived.
U.S.: Gold near the point of equation
"The euro will be maintained in the next few months in the half of 4,35 years, which will be accompanied by a weak link in global markets," says Michael Bolliger of the U.S. Health Management company.
"Waiting for a steady pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy is talking about stabilising gold notes in the current wave," an expert assessment with Bankier.pl.
His view, despite the apparent inflationary pressure of the Pension Policy Council, is not based on a double rate in the environment, in which the vast majority of central banks favour politics.
"If gold is really valued, the euro's notation should be maintained in the next few months in the half of 4,35 zeros – so little attractive are the Polish bonds according to it.
This is much more useful than the Polish paper offers bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of the asset allocation in the company Wealth Management.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the connique in the world.
"The global reconciliation can still deepen, but it should not come to a severe recession, but, most importantly, to the start of the PKB dynamics slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
"Innovators should ignore global actions that could undermine the lack of prospects for a trade conflict on the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donalda Trumpa and Brexit commitment procedure.
Europe should be relatively weak among the stock markets," the latest list of investors from the main management authority of the EU Health Management Mark Haefele.
"The actions of the euro area countries should be kept worse than the US, as they are more vulnerable to increased uncertainty about global trade and pre-relief concerns," we read in the document.
According to Michaela Bolliger, even at least 0.74 per cent, it is still possible to deepen the profitability of Germany's most dangerous debt markets.
In the longer term, however, the long-term profitability of long-term paper should not be longer-term, but only short-term, in order to reduce monetary policy.
The largest field for lowering the foot has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency in the horizon for the next few years.
The long-term balance point for the euro notes is $1.29, which would mean 19 per cent of the potential for encouraging the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fedu's pace, which will result in a reduction in the world's monetary policy.
"To maintain the long-term strength of the dollar, the current and budgetary deficits may not be allowed," says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehrer is losing his gun.
Official report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehrahra has recorded the destruction of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition items – resulting from the secret installation of the RFN defence resource.
Information was given by the press belonging to the media group EditationsNettwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document issued by the State Parliamentary Secretariat in MON Peter Taubera (CDU), two pieces of arms, one part of the weapon and 3474 pieces of ammunition have been recovered.
Among the military equipment still missing are six universal machine carbines MG3, 11 automatic G3, four automatic carbines G36, six signal guns and two P8 guns.
In addition, there are 30 lufs for MG3 carbines.
The concern was expressed by the Vice-President of the Lewica Party, Martina Renner.
According to the RND journalist, the number of weapons and ammunition lost is "sustaining".
Moreover, as a result of the investigations, only no part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner considered the effects of these actions to be a "dangerous balance".
It also pointed out that the establishment did not reveal whether there was also a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor of Karlsruhe charged him with preparing a heavy act of violence against the security of the State and violating the provisions of the law governing access to arms.
The official intends to prepare the closures on German secret policies with a view to obtaining legal and racist uprisings.
On his "black list" of goals, which had fallen into the hands of the prosecutor, were found, inter alia, the former Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Greens Party and Anetta Kahane, a defender of human rights and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally in possession of four weapons of fire, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
The crying children in the plane.
How to avoid them?
It's a solution.
The Japanese Airlines carrier has recently used the function developed with the idea of persons for whom travel in the company of the child is a nightmare.
By means of the Internet page, they allow you to check the location of the plane.
If the connection is travelling for the second year of life, the child's icon shall appear on a particular item reserved by parents or caregivers of the seat.
The same person using the carrier’s services has the option of choosing a place away from that occupied by the small person.
The BBC submits that the lines have already been informed of the imperfection of this solution.
"Children's icon" shall not appear when the ticket has been reserved by the third person or if the change of flight has occurred at the latest.
As expected, the idea divided the Internet.
Some Twitter users point out that travel with crying children can be solved by means of a hair losser.
They're kids, and we used to be them.
"We need to learn tolerance because soon we will need maps of places to sit for breathing lips or drinks," wrote user G Sundar.
Another interns noticed that he had been beaten by crying children at the airport, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a need for the solutions introduced by Japan Airlines.
"I thank you for warning me before crying children during a 13-hour journey," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorka's bank account of the travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not be arriving in October at the airport in Majorka as a result of the announcement on Monday by Thomas Cook's travel office.
As announced in the fifth report by the self-government representative of the Balearic Government Marc Pons, among the 25 thousand temporary residents who would not be able to use the late capital of Majorce, there are also those who were to travel with the companies directly related to Thomas Cook, for example Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 per cent of the expected temporary residents who were forced to leave their residence in Majorce in the coming month were German citizens and Scandinavian states.
However, as Pons claims, because Thomas Cook did not lead tourists on the Balearic Islands during the November period, there will be less losses for the local economy.
He stated that the Balearic Government had already begun negotiations with international operators on "Enterprise to the capital market" after the UK operator’s bankruptcy.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorce, I lost more than 1,000 people.
About 800 are fired by Thomas Cook's office in Palmia.
The rest of the people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of the fall by Thomas Cook in many major hotels, the owners of the property requested guests to pay extra fees per night.
This situation was experienced by several hundred tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Court contends that by Thursday, several hundred hotels in Majorce had been active at least by the end of October in connection with the announcement of Thomas Cook's fall and the company working with him.
On the other hand, the fifth newspaper “Diario de Ibiza” indicates that most of those working in Ibisa hotels who collaborated with the Thomas Cook group do not have the intention of closing places in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that the British bankrupt co-operated with 42 hotels on this Balearic island.
In an autonomous environment, the Balearic authorities announced that they would return to the Government of Spain for support of the region of EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bank announcement by Thomas Cook.
They found that the biggest damage to this tourist archipelago, about 36 thousand people, is found on Majorce.
According to the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is a local tourist company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts relating to the season of July–September 2019 about EUR 5 million.

‘Rz’: The government may be upset
"Effects of the Clean Air" programme are empty, and the carbon particles are going to fall off this winter as if nothing had ever happened," we read on the first page of the Today's "Creation Policy".
“This time, within the framework of the Clean Air Programme, 82 000 applications were submitted for the financing of a total of 2 billion malt, from which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
The applications accepted amount to more than 915 million zł", says "Rz", calling for data from the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred is returned from the programme.
The results of the proposed dry programme are assessed as "dangerous".
Self-governments, quoted by "Rz", are watching the outbreaks of "C clean air", i.e. in too much bureaucracy.
"The programme should be very simple: e-reporting, sending mail invoices, any express verification of implementation.
This would improve action," says the Burdzbark of Warmijski Jacek Wisniowski.
In the first year of action, the Polish Smogowe alerts noted that less than 1 per cent of the planned target of 3 million swabs was achieved.
As "Rz" notes, although the programme budget is 103 billion evil for 10 years, or 10 billion evil per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and the Water Economy, this year is reserved for a total of 1.4 billion evil," we read.

Manufacturer Barbie introduced a series of neutral sex jokes to the market
In addition to Barbie’s different skin color, figures, or haircuts, Mattel’s company has put on sale as neutral sex.
The "Creable World" series has a haircut.
So children can decide whether Barbie has short hair or long hair.
Their garden consists of both the floor and the kitchen.
The eyes of a girl can become boys and turn around.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different defenses.
It has also been rejected by emphasising the characteristics of the sexes – strange, with no more complete lips, long ears and thick ears or, in the case of Kena, large arms.
The company believes that children don't like when their boyfriends have broken sex standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that the games made with the idea of a particular sex are taking girls' ambitions and strengthening traditional stereotypes.
"New girls will let all children feel free," says Mattel.
Lalka Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in a high - speed shopping machine and shops, was repeatedly criticized for promoting “stereopy women, ” such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The group has responded to criticism and has already introduced the market with different skin colors, as well as with more round glass.
They've also been in the hijacking.
Zandberg: circle or club Together can have several jobs
Zandberg, asked in ZET radio , the role of his party's candidates can be reached by Sejma from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLDs whose list starts the candidates to Sejmu SLD, Wisny and Lewis Razem, starting with the common logo "Lewica"), replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the result will be very good because we feel that people are bound to hope that Levica is not only right anymore, but also strong," he noted.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60-80 jobs.
"This may mean that a circle or a club will have a number of jobs together.
But it depends on Poland and Poland.
I'm not gonna wake up and say what's going on," he said.
Asked whether Levica will have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are different, and we will not believe that there is no difference.
I think that this diversity of Poland has been rewarded because we have shown that by contrast, we have managed to achieve something in the common programme."
Asked whether the greatest beneficiary of the joint initiative is the leader of SLD Vladzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that his opinion is that the largest beneficiaries are the central and left elections.
In addition, given that the SLD will get the full subsidized, he said that "the political party's goal is to represent its voters."
Zandberg admitted that in the elections to Seym, he's voting for himself.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he noted that he was standing.
"The offer is different and in this offer there are candidates and candidates for which my heart is closer, but there are also those for which my heart is still."
"I will, however, tell you very kindly and clearly that if I were in the section of No. 44, I would take a vote and vote in the other round," he stressed.
"Why would I not try to vote in favour of Minister Kazimierza Ujazdowski (KO-PAP candidate)?" he added.
In this area outside of Transport, the leader of RP Pavel Kasprzak and Marek Rudnikki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: Open the biggest game in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the hall for the opening of a large game considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car, and dog to the Bopp district, where a new match was established, which could accommodate 30 thousand faithful.
The building was built by Brother Mouride, who belonged to the Suffic Islamic Network, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the sword began ten years ago in the sub-area of six hectares of land transferred by the government.
The name of the game Massalikul Jinan ('The Road to Paradise') comes from the title of the sword sword of Ahmado Bamba Mbakke, the 19th-century brother-in-law of the brotherhood, celebrated by the eyewitnesses as a saint.
The game is equipped with a career marble and has five minerals.
Most of them have 78 meters.
The game in the middle is 15 thousand faithful, and so many others can live on the outside.
In the wealthed interiors, you can admire the comfortable bathroom, giant gardening and decorations made hand-made by workers from Morocco.
The constructionists claim that the game is the largest in West Africa, but the game is still not compared to the games in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II game in Casablance can be located 105 thousand faithful.
The building project, which cost more than EUR 30 million, has been financed from private grants.
In addition to the land, the court has, however, put an end to lighting, sanitary equipment and financed road work of EUR 10.5 million.
Trainer Smile: Our problem is not Čląsk, only we ourselves
The eight-legislative game pass without the victory of the Corona pilots is trying to stop at the fifth meeting with the extra class of Słów.
"Our problem is not to redefine, only ourselves, we have to work on what we play," stressed coach Mirosław Smyła.
The Korona pilots last and until this time, the only victory in the people was in the first row, when they went out at 1:0 benemin of the game of the Sons of Commons.
They later recorded two remixes and six breaks, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Deep Lubin in 1/32 Puchar Polski.
"I am impressed by the fact that in the last seconds the gunman's game was fighting for the shoulder, they wanted to reassemble.
Their impact on the wall after the last scene did not result from the fall, but it was the fall of evil, because they were so close," said Shyla.
As he noted, Christmas has very strong roots, so he will be teaching the game together in the side sectors of the forest.
"We know the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.
In the fifth game in Koron, there is no doubt that the gold cards of Ognjen Gnjatic are overstated, and in the short run, Jacob Zübrowski and Michael Gardaski will also be arrested.
The building is, however, being reported in the shooting game by a number of players who want to play.
"We have a headache, it soon seemed that it won't be, and now it is," said Smile.
Coronian Daniel Dewniel stressed that Čłąsk will not be easy to break down the eight legal matches of the suit without winning, but everyone can win in the extraclass.
"We're a good team.
We may not show it in the past few weeks, but this moment will come that we will win and believe it will be Friday," said the pilot.
After nine extracluscs of the Corona with five points, point 15 is taken.
It's 12 more and it's raining somewhere else.
The fifth game in Kielcach will begin at 20.30.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42% of forest species in Europe are at risk," said the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) in the fifth "Red book of European Trees".
On the top of the list are cast iron and iron.
IUCN, an organisation in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European trees for the first time.
It has been prepared by experts who, on the basis of the studies, have submitted that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (also in other parts of the world) are “at a high level of risk”.
Among the causes of the Red Paper is the rapid expansion of urban agglomeration and global climate change.
However, the most dangerous are these trees and plants that appear only or mainly on our continent.
With regard to the type of European wood, it is estimated that 58 per cent of IUCN experts are at risk and 15 per cent, namely 66 wood and blood, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main reasons for the deterioration of the Red Paper is the exchange of errors in the exploitation of wood, the rapid urbanization, the excessive deforestation of trees, and the continued fire of forests and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a serious threat to the existence of many European alternatives to blood, mice and rats.
"The consequences of human activity lead to a gradual decline in European plant species and create a risk of the loss of important and undesired waste in Europe, which constitute the foundation of European ecosystems and have an impact on our planet's health," said Luc Bas, head of the European UICN.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600+
"Today Pis wants to buy Polishs, offering them freedom to borrow credit that will have to be paid by future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyn in a report for "Rzeczpopolitie".
In his opinion, "the whole Pis policy is a dick."
At the same time, politics promises that "what is given will not be banned".
Shetina, in her conversation with Jack Nizinkiewich, has the idea of respecting the Law and Justice.
It's about the mobilisation of the electricity at the polling stations.
In his view, opposition has greater potential in this regard than the Kacinski party.
"Today, people who know that they want to live in a normal state are more than PiS volunteers, a party that is opposed to the voiced values, such as humility, peace, transparency," says Schetyn.
The leader of the Civil Coalition and the president of the Civil Platforms also noted the basic implementation of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing will be collected, but a guide to the future, because the PiS is only about the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland to see even after the dramatic low investment," he said.
Secondly, it concerns "the energy consumption of Poland, aid and investment in those who work hard - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Shetina explains that in the KO programme there was, among other things, a project that was at least used by Poland to give more than 614 gold in hand and more expensive – even after several times.
The police have also noted that they don't want to go to a divorce.
As he said, do as much as he can, but don't promise 600+.
"Never will I allow the Greek option where the rulers have been licensed with a objection to divorce until the financial country has finally arrived," he stressed.
The report for "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Moraviacki were afraid to argue with him and Maljgorzat Kidada-Blonski.
"We'd have to overcome their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"He's going ahead of the crash.
The Kachin is a man like Banaš is Christian," he added.
Leader PO also said he didn't decide whether he would ask for the Platform's presidency.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors of Great Britain · Global Voices
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six dead large condors were found – informing TVN24.
Experts believe that their deaths caused human activity.
Great condors are likely to be opened up by means of killing predators, such as rats, lions, or wild dogs.
Animals could eat a toxic trap.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
"It is a great loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to multiply.
So we lose protected species, threatened species," says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, Argentina's environmental protection organization.
"I think that the use of toxic and toxic substances does not only pose a threat to the species, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": I want a dress for the President
They've been working on the recognition of the heads of the state of the road chain.
The idea of supporting Chancellor Andrzej Dudy – we read in the "Rzeczpopolis".
As a translator of the newspaper, it is about the gold chains of the Order of the White Orella, the royal insignia officially known during the Middle Ages as the Red Cross.
Last time he was probably used by President Ignacy Mśícki.
"Rz" suggests that soon such chains can be found on Andrzey Dudy's shoulder.
The Senate Commission on Human Rights, Law and Petitions issued a mid-term proposal for a renewed law on orders and designations to restore it.
The newspaper says it's not the first attempt to bring this chain back to the state's head.
This amendment was proposed by the Senate in 1992, but it was made by one vote.
This time, the work is delicious.
At the beginning of August, the senators committed this matter a few minutes, acknowledging that they are concerned about the opinion of the President's Office.
This happened in half a week.
"I am informed that the Chancellor of the RP does not pay attention to the position presented in the petition," then Prime Minister Andrzej Dera wrote.
In the middle of the case, the senate commission continued and resumed the case for a little time.
"The Chancellor replied briefly: it's for us to return it," said Commissioner Robert Mamatov of Pis, quoted by "Rz".
He made a proposal for legislative work supported by the Commission.
Police will teach drivers how to drive by crossing
The police action will be carried out, i.e. on the crossing of the Cieplinski al. Piłsudski.
Mudur activities have nothing to do with the recent burdens of city authorities on leaders who are not always able to maintain proper behaviour.
On Friday, 27 September, the police are launching a preventive action on the ‘Transport crossing’.
It is about eliminating obstacles in the road: driving to crossing without the possibility of driving, not applying to light signals or road signs.
"We often think we're on our own, and we're really making it difficult to live with another leader," said Marek Ustrobinski, vice-president of the city a few days ago.
His words drew attention to a press conference in which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of vehicles after crossings, which would in effect create steps.
At the time, the president appealed to the passengers for a reason on the road, including speeding up on the lights or not writing SMS on the road.
The issue was not taken seriously by the Russian police, who have since started the “Transport crossing” action.
What's going on?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of crossing the crossings by drivers who are unable to continue the journey.
This is often the result of making progress, which helps to overcome the difficulties in the movement and the creation of steps.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 zeros and 2 military points.
Moreover, global attention will be paid to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of crossings.
They will also observe the lack of speed of the vehicle, the delay under the signallings, the free passage of crossings and the delay of too much distance between the vehicles.
What steps will they take?
M.in. on ul. Lisa-Kuli from ul. Jajijellońska; al. Ceeplinński from al. Piłsudski; ul. Targowe from al. Piłsudski; Place of Shreniawit from ul. Dubrovski or ul. Hetmanski from ul.
This type of action will be carried out in the Subcarpathic tables on the following Friday.
They checked the waste disposal company from "Czeek"
"The Office of the Protection of the Environment of the Elderly of the Volominian and World Audit of the Construction Control has checked the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, in which wastes from the clean roads of "Czejka" in Warsaw have been removed," said the senior officer of the Walmanian Karol Szyszko.
The Vulmenian elderly inspectors carried out control at a facility located in the lakes of Zielonka.
The Dar-Transport Private Shipping Agency, under the agreement with the Czejka Central Cleaning Road, carries out the management services with spare parts.
"The installation has been completed and the company has also been requested to provide documentation relating to its activities," Szysko said.
He added that the audit report will be transmitted to the Warevords' Environment Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last control in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Vojevodzki Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was found that the company did not carry out sampling, measurements and underground water tests, nor did it have results from the studies of established municipal railways with the cleansing of the "Czeek" roads.
Following the control of WIOS, Darius Sobot was called to stop the breach of the terms of the decision.
DAR-TRANS Private DAR-Transport Dariusz Soboto is one of the company that collects waste in the form of fixed municipal bulkheads with a clean "Czeek".
According to the decision to carry out waste disposal on the territory of the product, wastes of up to 60,000 tonnes per year are processed in the lakes of Zielonki.
The Warsaw Local Water and Canal Company announced on Thursday, November and December 2018 that it was excluded from the operation by STUOS, which was related to the damage of one of the fuel equipment.
According to MPWiK, their monthly export costs are 1.7 million gross (as estimated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Walussa shot Maljugorzat in China-Blonish.
"You have taken up a difficult task, you may count on my full support," Lech Waluss said on Friday to the Kidawy-Blonish Małgorzat.
"Mr. President, for me this is very important words," said KO's candidate for the Coalition of Civil Affairs at the Prime Minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now "only a baby in the desert".
Maljgorzata Kidawa-Blonjska met on Friday with former President Leche Walus in his office at the Greek European Solidarity Centre.
In a short conversation behind closed doors, he also took part in the participation of the son of Valõssy, Jarosław.
"You have been given a difficult task," said Lech Waluss after the meeting.
"You may count on my full support," he added.
"The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
That is why the great hope is that you will be able to deal with these problems as a woman, and all of us – those who love Poland – will fully support your action," the president said, turning to Kidaw-Blonski.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Blonn was grateful for the support.
"Mr. President, this is very important to me because no one like you can talk about freedom, the constitution and know what is important," she said.
"Let us show that we can do another, smart policy together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, according to respect for others.
You did that to your revolution, and we want to change Poland," said Kidawa-Blonish.
Cubic and Emeryturde
In his interview with the journalists, Walussa said he is now "only a kid on an american tour".
"Of course I look at it.
I hope we'll turn away from what was good, checked, we'll come back.
The tripartite of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And that's all we need to clean up, that's all we have to do back to normal action, and I believe we do this together.
Because if not, it's waiting for us street criteria," Lech Waluss said.
"That is why it is so important for Poland to proceed to the elections, stand up and make a decision on its own.
And that's the most important thing," said Kidawa-Blonish.
"The last chance that the map will improve the situation of things in Poland," the president replied.
"We must build on a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes to be made in Poland, Kidawa-Blonish said: "The President has said very well.
We need to build on a new foundation, on which we can do all other things.
If there is no third party of power, unless the constitution is respected, we must go back to the beginning and bring it to reality and to all know that Poland will not even move forward."

The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendment legislation on the disclosure of family members of the most important state officials and the fleets of the most important persons in the country.
Following the renewal of the laws on the property of state officials – without amendment – 52 senators were voting, 14 were opposed, three were held in favour of the vote.
The same senators decided to reject 12 amendments, which were reported during the environmental debate by Senator PO Slavomir Rybicki.
According to the amendment, the Act was to "improve" and to limit the scope of the information provided in the declaration on the situation of own children, children of married couples, children who are eligible for the cases in which children remain in the common household with a person obliged to make a statement.
The Act on the Publicity of the Family of the Most Important State Officials, which was established in the Prime Minister's office, was adopted by Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions stipulate that, inter alia, prime minister, ministers, jobs, messages to the EP, senators, presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those in favour of other State institutions, will be obliged to place in the declaration of ownership of the property of persons, children and persons residing in common service.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the laws on the fleets of the most important persons in the country.
It regulates which flights have the status of HEAD and who may be on board government aircraft, along with the most important persons in the country.
The Statute also specifies who is responsible for conducting the Central Lotts Register.
Under the law - without amendment - 55 senators were spoken against, 12 were opposed, four were held by the vote.
According to the law, each flight of the President will be "in the official mission".
Members of the family and others invited by the President will be allowed to accompany the president in the flights.
Instead, the flight to the official prime minister's mission and to the Seym and Senate's passengers will only be "remained in order to carry out the tasks directly related to the performance".
The Constitution also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
A member of the delegation may be provided by the regulations on the flight crew, at the request of employees, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; and journalists.
In accordance with the law, if there are doubts about the fleets of Seym and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will be able to explain them.
If such doubts are not clarified within a specified time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to inform the Chiefs of the Seym or the Senate of the lack of the possibility of such a flight.

The Polish seats were held on Friday for the first training in Paris, where on Saturday they will be in a brass medal match.
The later Vitala Heyna's way to fight the title closed the fourth verse of Proverbs 1:3 in Lublin.
It was loud about their mistakes on the trip to this unit.
This time, without such problems, they met with the Slovaks in Paris on Friday morning, and a few hours later they took training in the famous Berlin Hall.
According to the relationship of the people present on the stakes, the master of the world was subsidized.
As Assistant Minister Heynna Michał Mieszko Gogol noted, this, together with the main task, was not the same as the training of Sitkar elements.
"We went to the dress, but in most of the time it was time for the team.
It's about spending more time with him than training.
Let's talk, imagine how it's all going to build up as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both the employees and the school staff.
"We have been brutally brought to the ground.
Without two opinions, we're disappointed.
We still believed we were going back to that game.
We discussed this game between us in the room, and the coach talked to the employees.
As two main causes of injuries, I would indicate ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual finding yourself with the situational pills.
The Slovenians were much better in this respect than we are," he analyzed.
In his view, the "Biol-Red" has not been a stumbling block to the opposition from the voice-supported and numerous advertising of the co-economic tournament.
He admitted that the masters of the world could have had something to do with the smooth road to the semifinal.
"Maybe, if we had a gap in the group phase, we would have analyzed this lesson more quickly and later we would have played in the next stage of the tour.
But it's just a dream," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the evil associated with the fourth plague of Poland will be able to turn into aggression in the sword of the bridge.
"I hope we will show our real faces right now.
It's about what to do.
Last ME medal we fought in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poland during these visits.
In the group phase, they ran into Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two meetings of the group phase they met in Appledourn, and at the semifinal they moved to Lublin.
Nick Kyrgios: a serious car, but in a hangover
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week start warrant and a fine of $25,000, in a half-year-old suspension, for winning words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
Actors ATP World Tour lose patience in Kyrgyzstan, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summation of the most undisclosed tennis player in the last few years seems to be dangerous – 16 weeks plus a rough fight, but both of them are suspended for half a year – a test period in which a black player can be repaired.
Nick Kyrgios has only been 24 years old, but he's been breaking up for a long time and he's been making his tennis record of the world – he's had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules on and around the card.
Voting curses, strange gestures, non-portable behaviour, court-martial and visas, losing two rockets during the losing battle with Karen Chaczanowe – all of this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.
In the US Open 2019 he also did not play long, but he was obliged to publicly say that ATP operators were “simply disappointed”, which caused the organisation's authorities so much that they carried out a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyzstan, and after a few weeks they gave the above-mentioned statement about the suspension of the beginnings and the next crime.
However, the word of corruption was forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, according to the tennis player, the investigation showed that Kyrgyzstan's behaviour over the past 12 months has, in many cases, been a serious threat and a rather persistent violation of the principle that without delay it has acted as a wulgarous person in terms of tournaments and sights, from the height of the tax.
However, ATP gave him five days to make a call, and immediately forced him to execute the sentence, ordering him to comply within the next six months with the conditions: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgyzstan tournaments, he can no longer break the rules of the Code of Conduct of the Active Professional Tennisers, in particular, he can no longer break down, break down the rocket, break down with the courts and with the public, nor any other way of keeping himself unhindered and wulgar.
He also received the recommendation to seek “sustainable support” from mental trainers during the tournaments and to consult with people who are specializing in resolving the problems of sportsmen who do not deal with their own behavior.
The first comment (in social media) by Nick Kirgios was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practical practice, he will have at least two-year break, since in Pucharze Lavera, he had to leave the nearest beginnings in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
At the ATP Kyrgios branch, ATP is occupied by 27 places.
In that year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he made over 1.3 million dollars, so he will stay even after a few minutes.
GUS: More and more lives in Poland
From the GUS's report on domestic budgets published on Friday, it is estimated that, as a good or better, its material situation has been assessed in b.r. up to 44 per cent of them.
In the previous year, this percentage was 37.2 per cent, 33.5 per cent in 2016, and since 2009, when the statistical authority first examined the objective assessment of the domestic economy, it has never exceeded 30 per cent.
It considered its material situation to be bad or even worse, totalling 8.1 per cent of households, compared to 11.2 per cent of the previous year and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best is the material situation of the households working on their own account.
In this group, 70 per cent of respondents are considered to be either good or bad.
On the other hand, households have a rate of 18 per cent of these responses.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the objective assessment of the material economic situation in the home.
The most important thing is to know the parents themselves who are producing offspring, among which 32% declare the material situation good or right.
The percentage of children is between 55% and 60%, and 48.8% of households are homeless.
The effects of the 500+ programme are clearly visible in these statistics.
Before he was launched (in 2016), his worst material situation was evaluated by the parents of the growing generation and of the many-day families (with at least three children).
The improvement of the objective assessment of the material situation in Poland is to reflect rapid income growth, above all from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be a good one increases faster than real income.
Furthermore, there is no clear dependence on the level of management between income and the assessment of the material conditions of the home economy.
The best estimates describe the inhabitants of the Polish leadership, where they consider their situation to be better or better than 48.9% of the researchers.
The leaders of Lubuski (47.7 per cent), Slavic (47.6 per cent), Mazowickie (47.3 per cent) and West West Sea (47.1 per cent).
At the time, in Opolski, the regulatory income (e.g. after payment of taxes and deposits) amounted to 94 per cent of the national average and 98 per cent of the national average.
The highest income of the inhabitants of Mazowisky (120 per cent of the national average) and of the Dutch (104 per cent).
In 2018, the average figure for the person in Poland was 1693 gross.
In real terms, the price change rate increased by 4.3 per cent by 2017.
In the last few years, it's a lot of low.
In 2016 the figure rose by 7% and by 6.3% later.
While income growth is slowing down, it also reduces expenditure growth.
In the case of a person, the injury was reported in the figure 1187, which means that the actual injury was reduced by 0.7%.
This is the first such event since 2013.
In 2017, personal expenditure actually increased by 1.9 per cent and 4.3 per cent by 2016.
Household budget surveys suggest that the domestic economy currently accounts for 70.1% of its regular income, while in 2014 it exceeded 80% and increased by 90% by 2006.
Paulina Smašt-Kurzajewska in a beautiful blue
Paulina Smašt-Kurzajewska appeared on the closing display of the label “Patrizia Pepe”.
Her styling wasn't really about the results.

A woman picked up a white chair under a black shirt that was strong enough for her to shine.
USA: Three suicides in the airport
Three Marines filled up suicides on the USS George H. W. Bush's crew last week – informing the U.S. Mariner of war.
Over the last two years, five members of the crew have been killed in the sum.
The previous suicide took place in July this year, and earlier in November 2017.
As CNN is administered, all three mariners were shot last week.
Each of the events came to life when USS George H. W. Bush settled in Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties in the case has been excluded.
In addition, deaths should not be related to themselves.
"All need to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent further suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stimulation or any other repertoire related to the search for help," wrote Captain Sean Bailey, ship's witness on Facebook.
Non-violent criticism of paper.
John Paul II did nothing
In his discussion with Peter Lekszyk, Stefan Niesiołski pointed out that in 1981, John Pavel II was responsible for the opposition workers.
"In fact, every opinion was accepted."
Some of his actions later came up.
“For me, that John Paul II failed to eradicate the harmful activity of Rydzik, he is very grateful for his pontification.
However, the redemptorist – the traitors of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way for the life of Pope Polak," he explained.
A PO policy was acknowledged: “There were times of discontent, because the pope had said something that Rydzik had not accepted, but he had the authority and could simply leave the church or send him to New Caledonia or Fiji to get money for the victims.
However, John Paul II did not do so, like his successor," he explained.
"In addition, this fatal case of pedophilia and the actions of the Church has been brought to an end, and indeed their lack of.
I ran away a little bit before, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We know about the pedophile scale in the Church from relatively recent times.
The question arises as to how it might be possible that John Paul II, being head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," says the newspaper Niesiołovski.
In the evaluation of the former PO policy of the Polish Church, he is a associate of the PS.
“It must be acknowledged that during the time of the Solidarity of the Church, the Church was our most important associate.
All the beauty began from the holy moons, all around the sky.
Now these circles are written, they become a symbol of the dictatorship — a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: One of the most unacceptable surprises is that such people as Rydzyk are the third Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is a Pis.
It's a black division of the Polish Church that will come to pay him a fine," Niesiołski said.
"I hope that the Pope of France will kill Jordan, Rydzika and a few others of this kind," he added.
HROBIAZO: Trade in the morning 590th anniversary

PZPN smokes burdy creams at the stadiums.
Disk-qualified Collection
The start of the Puchar Poland between Griffy Wejherovo and Lechi Gdańsk about the small hair did not end tragically when the Wejher racer-crackers dropped by a millimeter of the opposing army, Zlatana Alomerovicia.
After this incident, the match was stopped for 20 minutes.
This case was examined by the PZPN Commission in the event of a serious injury to Griffa, excluding him from the upcoming events.
The club will not be able to start in Pucharze Polski in the 2020/2021 season.
Additional chips will not be placed in the nearest match at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to go out on the league games until 31 December.
The Burdys at the stadium of the See Łódź also called the islands of the Wrocław.
However, the PZPN was easier here, since Čląsk said he could come to the same events and trained the competent authorities on this issue.
In addition, the services allowed the shipyards sector to be abandoned by raccoons, the fireplaces and the strengthening of the economic sector.
The fight was suspended for eight minutes, and the interpolation had to use the water weapons.
The PZPN attacked Čląsk with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in Pucharze Polski and prevented the organisation of the exits to the sword in this and the subsequent release of the PP.
The order of exit also included the legal game of the Extraclass, but it ended on 31 December.
Name of border cities on road signs also after Poland
GDDKiA plans to exchange the full-managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDKiA Lines
In Subcarpathia, a renewed regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure concerning, inter alia, the name of border cities on road signs also began to be implemented in Poland.
For example, "Low" appears next to "L'viv".
Our guide will introduce changes to 94 road signs set out in A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The more we hear, the easier, the easier, the easier.
The new guidelines will result in the renewal of the Minister for Infrastructure Regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that local names in neighbouring countries often also have Polish accents.
Thanks to the changes we have made, they will appear on the road along our roads.
The introduction of a new marking starts from the undercarp of the A4 highway," Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk informed.
Under-carpathic changes will be introduced to 94 road signs set at A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment costs?
200 grand.
In the first instance, a new marking will be applied on the A4 highway, scheduled for 1 November 2019.
How is the realization of the mind to look?
He'll eat without changing the table, in principle.
They will now replace the names of the new localities written in Polish on existing characters.
Both names will be written in one version – in the first sequence after the Polish and then in the original, in the Nahuatl.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the names of foreign cities in the country in which they are located.
Feel the game together with Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One
Razer announced Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One – first in the world headset to Xbox One inspired by hack technology.
HyperSense ensures in-game pollution and better control over the environment.
Razer HyperSense uses the hypnotic solutions developed by Loft, a German company specializing in the creation of advanced hypnotic technologies that provide realistic impact on the subject.
HyperSense uses special hackers and smart digital transforming signals to generate a relatively high frequency feedback in real time, giving the possibility of full confusion in each Xbox One game.
Technology recognises sound signals and transforms them into dynamic vibrations, which enables players to get involved in a game without the need to install additional software.
By using the concept of touch, sound signals can be closely followed by action in the game.
Razer HyperSense plays an event – from quiet steps after a powerful explosion, giving exactly all the activities around the game.
“Nari Ultimate for Xbox One has been designed to ensure that all players have additional game sizes.
Thanks to HyperSense, we allow them to be completely confused in their favorite titles," said Alvin Cheung Senior Vice President of the Razer paraphernalia devices.
Wholesales are equipped with filled pans with a memory of the shape and taste of the colder soul, with a view to reducing the heat generated during long-term use.
For an even easier hearing service, a fast-pressure pressure was placed on the raised microphone, and a sound controller for HyperSense action and a balance sheet between the game and the chat.
The self-adhesive to the head of the head of a fire ensures no problem and precise adjustment.
In addition, Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One has Xbox Wireless function, which allows direct connection to the console without needing to use the wireless delivery device, which allows for easy and fast configuration.
Listeners also provide Windows Sonic system, providing more realistic sound.
Razer Nari Ultimate, originally designed for PC computers, was on the market in September 2018.
Thanks to Nari Ultimate for Xbox One, Razer can now offer this rewarded technology with Xbox One.
The scheme was assessed at EUR 219.99.
Someone shot the windshields.
In the state of Germany in the Netherlands, the inhabitants noticed a lack of problems with insects.
After the discovery and the visit to the veterinarian, it was shown that someone made himself out of an animal of the target – in his body was found a way out of the winds.
"The early flight information was received from all residents of the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Dead Animals in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken legs.
We got married.
It's been a while since he's seen something very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so that he wouldn't get hurt and get extra stress.
The lion was taken and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was already reported that someone made himself a gunpowder with it.
In his body, he had a stroke," says Marcin Nadasek, president of Malpol’s management company, including the rehabilitation centre.
It is assumed in the centre
"The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, provided access to water, safe place in the centre, where the whole winter is spent.
We're trying to strengthen him.
It's not possible to fly.
Leaving him now would be related to the fact that he probably wouldn't survive winter," he adds.
After a rehabilitating failure, the staff intends to release him on his way to the same station.
The Zukowice Gminice authorities, after receiving information on the cause of poor animal health, intend to inform the prosecutor.
The event occurred in the United States
Gowin: "We need to wake up Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will have to be asked whether you have any instruments to encourage Polish trade," said the fifth vice-president, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
Gowin, during his talk in the "Signals of the Day" on the radio Unit, said that the trade is perceived by international networks that are so low on Polish producers that the Polish companies can't develop.
In view of the fact that it was very difficult to fight this problem, the Vice-President recalled that the Pis Government was trying to focus on this at the very beginning of the term, but had gained "control from the EC".
"We have won before the trial of justice, and I hope that if the United Nations wins the closest elections and forms a government, we will return to this subject," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Poland and therefore a small trade".
"It will be necessary to ask whether the government has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May the EU court found that the European Commission made a mistake by acknowledging that the Polish tax on retail is not authorised by public aid.
The tax law on retail sales established two rates of tax from trade: 0.8 per cent from income between 17 million and 170 million per month and 1.4 per cent from income above 170 million per month.
The tax was to be applied since September 2016.
In September 2016 the EC initiated an infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax may make smaller stocks known as public aid.
She then claimed that the sentence was put into force in a manner contrary to the law.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until the end of its analysis by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The EU court decision opened the way for the re-entry of taxes, but did not end the proceedings.
On 24 July the Commission lodged an appeal in the Court of Justice.
In the fourth quarter of the TEU's press services, the TEU submitted to the PAP that the issue is now in writing, where both the European Commission and the Polish Government are presenting their arguments in writing.
In the event of a breach of the procedure, the hearing of the party and any report shall not be known.
It takes a few good months from the submission of a call to the vote.
"This procedure lasts about a year," said the PAP from the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How to get a child to be baptized?
We're assuming a few practical solutions.
Baptism is especially important in the life of a child and his parents.
Often, it is the first time a child gathers together around the family, sharing his presence in the world.
It's no wonder, then, that the freshly secured moms and dad want their comfort to look like the best day of the day.
Before you make the final decision about the child's machine, however, you will wonder if it will be okay too.
I can find a lot of machines that do not provide little comfort.
So what should we focus on?
The basic criterion of selecting the infant to be baptized is the age of the child
In recent years, a few hours of small pieces of wood, made of white cloth, were put into the same beaks or large air.
Today, children who join the ranks are often older: monthly, year-olds, and even older.
It's not easy to think that such a great journey is already needed by another barrier to baptism.
So if your child on the day of baptism is 3 to 4 months old, he or she will be able to earn a living in a car or at the hands of a Christian parent or child.
The best way to do this will be to make it in comfortable, furnished bedrooms or complete.
Although this guard is recognized as a watch every day, it is sufficient to look for its excellent options, for example with a falbank or crown.
For a boy, it's perfect to see the points with the pressure of the mouse and the shell.
In the case of older children, you can allow yourself to have a greater imagination in the womb.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, fat succulence
Many of the girls’ parents look down on the rich, falsified kisses on the face of baptism in a complex with plates, sheets, and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial, non-smokering materials in which the child is simply not compatible.
The search for the appropriate packaging will make it easier to look at the Asanti for Kids box, which offers elegant machines on the cotton floor.
Delicacy, physical background, satin juices, chestnuts, applications, and great supplements will make your girl look beautiful and feel comfortable.
Ideal mirror for a small gentleman: cotton yarn
More recently, among the parents of boys, the fashion was a copy of the "increasing" model.
Poliestro marinars and ladies, strong colleagues or caskeettes often made young elegances express their discontent with their voice.
Today, they've been released for happiness by fine, well-fashioned completes.
It's enough to look at the set available in Asanti for Kids, that's soft, attractive shoes, and that blouse comes from the front of the truck.
These stars look very handsome, and they don't ruin the spirits of the world knowing the little one.
Christian Pavlovic published a real - estate statement
The Christian Paulic made a personal statement at the end of the term.
The result is that the PS messenger collected 110 thousand lives.
Let's remember that Pavlovic told us to get out of politics.
At the end of the term, the amount is 110 thousand zł
As a result of the declaration made by the consignment, it collects a monthly amount of 4.7 thousand malt.
The employer has a living value of 570 thousand dollars and a little less that he hires, taking 880 dollars a month.
The mission also invests in industrial metals, estimating the investment of 150 thousand zv.
The previous statement of ownership was also published by Jarosław Kaczijński.
Voting over the suspension at the Conference of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentarians voted against the three-day break at the Eziby Gmin Forum at the annual conference of the Conservative Party's programme.
It was reported to be 289, against 306.
Izba Gmin does not normally hear during the party conferences, so that the ministers do not have to give up or participate in them, nor at Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties felt that in such a critical time as they were last week before the 31st October of the Great Britain's departure from the European Union, Parliament should not interrupt the work.
At the request of the Government, 289 posts were announced against 306.
Two opposition parties already after conventions
The lack of agreement may be accepted as a political position of opposition to Prime Minister Borise Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the second decision was adopted by the Court of Justice as the Supreme because of a lack of law and absence) and for the fact that the judges did not want to ask for it.
After this decision, Izba Gmin resumed the middle session, and the most important event of the day was the presence of Johnson and the subsequent brutal debate.
Johnson ordered the opposition to block the Brexit and avoid prior elections.
"The time has come to realize brexit.
It needs to be realized in order to secure the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit has to make sure that we can deal with citizens' priorities, health services, the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite the country," Johnson said.
The Conference of the Conservative Party should begin in Manchester on the next Sunday and be held on Wednesday 2 October.
The two main opposition groups – Labour Parties and Liberal Democrats – have already held.
One of the reasons which Johnson gave to explain such a long delay in Parliament was the very party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-polic retort of Israeli leaders," says the foreign media.
The President's spokesman made this statement very clear.
"It's just a lie," he wrote on Twitter Blažej Spychalski.
Israeli media, including “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, calling on “Jewish Insider”, writes Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with the representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the RP consulate in New York, said that Israel will be responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-polic retort of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel Katza, who stated in a letter that “Police had sent anti-Semitism with the milk of the mother”.
Andrzej Duda said he regret that Israel did not ask for a rebuttal of his policies.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against Ambassador Polski in Israel by Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who called him "Polak, Polak".
"The quote is not only inadequate.
It's just a lie," he wrote on Twitter Blažej Spychalski.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland”.
I think Spychalski's portal was "thinked of it."
According to the “JI” speakers during the meeting, the dispute was also reached between the Holocaust oval, marked by the RP Commander’s Order of the RP Edward Mosberg and Shmuley Boteach’s Arab.
Mosberg had to agree with President Dudy's words and to say that the Jews in Israel "like Israel Kac" are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to Botech's source, he had to stop Mosberg's announcement.
Who's Banas and what's wrong?
The client hired by the truck manager led the journalist to discover the interests of Mariana Banasia's property declarations.
We're thinking about the next deal that's inspired by the government's forces.
TV journals "Supervisor" revealed that Marian Banas, president of the Supreme Court of Control, has not written in recent years the declaration of a 400-metre-stone property located in the Krakow Podgorz.
More than that, his employer had to drive him into the mentioned feces (and thus rent room for hours).
On the other hand, the building has been in line with the 2016 credit guarantee.
Bertold Kittel drew attention to the injustice in the "Superviiser" program.
The newspaper stated that from Banasia, they hired people associated with the world of crime to use it as a place of “annual meetings”.
Customers were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
Banaš responded in a clear and subtle way.
Interestingly, purchased by truckers, the journalist has led to the discovery of entertainment in real-time news reports in Banasia.
The stone itself was described in detail, and the result of its rent was to be reduced.
"The property of Mariana Banasia and his wife can be from 6 to 8 million evil.
In the sum of the weddings, two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", says Money.pl.
And as a result of the portal analysis, the Banasian Stone itself was already about 3 million evil.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting control of the property declarations of Mariana Banasia for 2015-2019.
Banasz said that it would stop its activities in the NIK by the time of its end. "I'm going to get you a ticket for free," he said.
The objection is made clear.
“We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or has speeded up the investigation of the statements of the owners Mariana Banasia.
Therefore, we are also forced to send out the authorities of the state and inform them of the possibility of committing the crime [...]," said PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If normal Poland had so low an estimated rent of its properties, it would already have 10 controls, tax allocations and carn-carb proceedings," he added.
He went high, he fell low.
Marian Banas is a new president of the Supreme Court of Control.
The position was adopted on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term.

"Special police": The police will be punished for ignoring the police's recommendations
As the newspaper puts it, facilitating the order of certain behaviour issued by the police should be a new type of move, a threat of crime, arrest or restriction of freedom.
The police officers want to make such changes.
The idea came to the Commission's attention on Petitions.
"The matter is serious, as more than half a million cases have been brought to the Polish courts every year," we read.
The "Special Police" stated that the petition, which the Independent Police Service wrote to the press on the change of the Code of Conduct, is likely to lead to a change in the code of conduct.
The applicants propose a new amendment to Article 54a of the Code of Conduct.
He should state: “He who does not agree with the request or recommendation of a public official issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law, is subject to arrest, criminal or deprivation of liberty.”
‘See paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of a identical penalty for those who do not comply with the recommendations, are unable or difficult to carry out the service activities,’ the paper states.
Sociojolog Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolitaj" that although it agrees with the main transmission of the draft regulation, he fears that if it is implemented, it may be used in political demonstrations.
"In situations of free demonstration, it would be useless and instead of remedying the situation, thereby threatening it," he adds.
The statistics reported by the newspaper show that 86 per cent of the population assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services took 1.5 million intervention in the city.

One of the boys from birth didn't give a voice, and for the second time he kept quiet in quiet times.
But these are not the richest ones of this story.
All of them are the only board to observe the world, where there is no place for artistic horsemen anymore.
It's a world filled with provinces, old societies, people who look at people, and a young man who's a good youth.

Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook Bankruptcy
Although the British travel office Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian branch of Neckermann works.
But the company has problems.
According to VRT TV, the Brussels Airlines announced that they are withdrawing 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy.
Neckermann also released 75 employees.
All exits from the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but they will be able to recover money in the meantime.
The court in Gandawi also announced the fall of three Belgian girls: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently about 12 thousand Belgians live outside the border on the exits purchased by Thomas Cook.
The next 40 thousand people had to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Colonel Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is currently "in full operation" despite the announcement of a fall by British company to a mother who caused a disturbance between employees and customers.
The Bureau then arranged for customers who bought the trip to it to go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, one of the oldest and most important travel offices in the world, announced a fall in the night from Sunday to Sunday.
The direct cause of the bankruptcy was decreased in the weekend of discussions with creditors and potential investors.
In addition to the agreed settlement plan of 900 million dollars, it was agreed that the company would receive additional 200 million as security for winter times when the travel offices normally have lower turnovers.
However, the company's problems have been growing for a few years, with the effect of a debt of 1.6 billion pounds.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer was prepared for the future German Görlitz.
Action will help in combating the progressive decline in the number of urban residents.
Görlitz is the most isolated one on the east side of Germany.
A beautiful pastry old man gets 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is faced with significant problems.
The lowest payments are made in Görlitz in Germany.
The city also has a permanent residence of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left on the west side of the country, which moved to the fall of the city by 25 per cent.
In 2013, it was made up of 54 thousand people.
In an attempt to combat the population, officials came to the point of offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
The program reached 150 requests.
Two thirds of them were represented by the inhabitants of large cities.
The programme also interested people from Hungary, Czech Republic, the United States and Great Britain.
"When we applied, we thought the program should convince people to drive to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.
"We now feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand volunteers, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the country.
While the city authorities hope that some will take place on a permanent basis, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the programme participants.
Information collected from notices and questionnaires is helpful in restoring smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to do – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with the idea of attracting new residents, offering them incentives to be accommodated.
The first of these was Detroit, who introduced a program of payment to promising young life specialists and work in the city every year.
Today such solutions are applied in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera after Candela in Italy, or in the U.S. Tulsey in Oklahoma.
