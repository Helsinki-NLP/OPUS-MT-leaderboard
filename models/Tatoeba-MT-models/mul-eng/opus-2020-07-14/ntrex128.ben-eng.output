Welsh Asembili thinks they're "like a map"
Many of the Azembili members are working hard to change their traditions to MWP (Member A. Welsh Parliament).
The aim of this attack is to change the name of Asemelli and to change the Wesh Parment.
Assembly members of various political groups are afraid to focus on the change and face the revolution.
One Liberian team member said his group was worried that "Twp and Pwp are at the top of the novel."
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, Twp's money and Pwp's money.
One of the film's members said they were "not in India" as a group and suggested the option.
A member of the Welsh Conzarevative Party said that the group saw the change in the name as "open mind" but pointed out that the differences between the MWP and the scale were relatively simple.
In this sense, the rise of West Burn Dublin is similar to the rise of the U.S. English version of Irkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently implementing the rules for the start of the name change process, says: "The members will have to make their own decisions as soon as possible."
The Governor of the Worlds Act 2017 granted the right to change their names to the World Assembly.
In June, the Commission published a public report that changed the name of Asemelli and supported many proposals for the Welsh parliament.
In the case of members of Asembili, the Commission supports the Welsh Parliament's memo or the WMP, but the majority of the MWPs have been supported by the population.
Assumptions suggest different options, but it will be difficult to reach an agreement for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who will spend a few weeks in court.
In this version, there will be a variety of changes in the asylum policy, including the lack of asylum membership and the purpose of the committee.
After the debate on this issue, the members of the Assembly will be given an opportunity to vote quickly about what should happen to them.
Macedonians vote in a resolution to change the country's name
To change their country's name, the voters will vote on whether "Republic of North Macedonia is to be changed."
The popular vote is being held in a ten-year-old contest with the neighboring country Grace, whose country is called Macedonia.
Athens has long been claiming that the name of its neighbours is a symbol of the country's demand for their territory and therefore has responded to the call for members of the country's European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian president, George Ivanov, who was opposed to the change of name, said he would ignore the genocide.
Despite the fact that supporters of genocide, including Prime Minister Joran Zaev, feel that change of name is a necessary step towards joining only the European Union and NATO.
The St. Martins will reduce the hour of the harvest while the churches of Harlem are drinking
"I spoke to the ancient people I spoke to," said Mr. Adams, saying that there was a church and a panshala in every place in history."
"There's no such thing today."
He said it's understandable that the Panshala is gone.
It's now "people's social communication in a different way."
"Panshala are no longer a living room where everyone goes on a regular basis."
As for the teacher, he is concerned about the money that the leaders are selling, not the day they think, "But today and tomorrow, they're going back to where they started."
He also said that in the area of the church, an apartment building and a condom can be built on the ground where all people who do not help the other religions in the area will be able to live.
"This is all building for most of those who will be condominiums," he said, "but they will celebrate the day of the closing of these churches because most of the people who come to the condominium are likely to be members of the church."
Harlem was established by the two church members – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade later by St. Martins.
In 1930, the Mül Shang Methodist Congregation left the church.
A friendly congregation in nearby worship takes possession of the building.
Reverand John Howard Johnson, a charitable congregation under St. Martins, who has refused to hire and punish farmers in the Hendred And Toenty Fifth Street, gives guidance to a lawyer who is a leading target for the cancer in Harlem.
In 1939, a fire accident badly damaged the building, but the citizens of Fadar's parish planned to restore it, and they set up the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, Fadar Johnson's son, and St. Martin's successor, Karilon, is giving the "Creed Man's Time" to Carlin.
Last July, a specialist in Carlin's career, he said something else: "It's a historical resource" and "an incomplete historical device."
In particular, the University of Michigan, Tifani, adds that it is the world's most important carillion in the area of a farm farm, which was sold by Dionie A. Lind, who was appointed to play a larger career 18 years ago by the Riverside Church.
Mr. Meriewood said St. Martins did not replace him.
Last few months, what happened in St. Martin was a sad event for the rest and the addressees, who were led by the general leaders of the church or the Episcopal Dioceses.
Vestri – Paris's Governoring Body, which was built with the general leaders – has been aware of their concerns in July that they think they will move costs from the Diocese Vestrie, even though the Diocese's mission was not linked to the position of the representatives.
Several Paris members accused of a lack of transparency in the work of the Diocese.
A 13 - year - old girl in California was attacked by a snake
A 13-year-old boy in Hungary was attacked by a 13-year-old boy after the first day of the Ganda Moussam massacre, the workers reported.
The attack took place seven mornings ago near Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel San Diego told KSWB TV that he was able to hear the boy crying for help on Saturday morning at about two o'clock in the morning, helping him to get out of the water with a group of people.
Hamel said, at first he thought the boy was trying to hold a bottle of cheese, but then he said, "You know, the boy said, 'I've got a job!'
'I've got a job!'
Her neck was down," Hamel said, he came to see the boy.
"I'm trying to get out of the water for all of us, saying, "There's a horn in the window!" adds Hamel.
The boy is being sent to the San Diego Children's Hospital, where he is in serious condition.
The nation of the attacker Han has not been informed.
Lifgard Captain Larry Jills' News Briefing says there was a famine in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found not to be a dangerous nation.
Jills adds that the victim has suffered a serious injury on his back.
The workers have started from the Pontou Beach of Casablad to the Soami of Ensinitas to the Ensinitas for 48 hours in the security field.
Jills reports that there are more than 135 people in the region, most of which are not dangerous.
Cinnsbury is planning to enter the U.S. government market
Censbury Bots, Superdragg and Debenhams have become a rival in the case of a doorman who has been represented by a department store owner and a professional assistant.
The large figure will be taken into 11 countries as part of the US $2.8 billion market access effort, and will be carried out in other countries as a result. The U.S. economy will increase where the necessary materials are available in the fashion and in the home.
The program comes in turn because supermarkets are looking for a new way to fill the shells with TV, microwaves and home appliances.
Censbury said it will double the amount of its representative supplies to be made up of 300 items, including Revolon, IZ, Tujerman and Doctors.
There will be more special Renez, such as Lariel, Mebelin and Barts, where there will be different places for brands such as Bots.
The Supermarket is running a botique makeup race to make most of Vigan Fredley – which has become very popular among black players.
On the other hand, the perfume vendor De Fregren's oath will be tested by two censorships at the door, which was first held in South London's court last week, and the second will be held in the next part of the year by Seli Ok of Bergingham.
The online market and the local mouthpieces of food cannas are trying to increase the market for credit.
Mike Kup, the chief director of Cinsbury, said that the outlets should be seen as the distribution store because Supermarket China is competing with the doors of the valley, such as Aldi and Lidl, and will have more services and no food.
Two years ago, Argos and Habitats China had lived in a hundred stores and opened several Habits, which had been sold by Modi and had made more profits.
The previous attempt to set up the Supermarket and Farmesi section failed.
A joint project with the first Fika Bots of the 2000 Cinsburys was examined, but the project ended up in conflict with how the profits from the Commissioner's docks would be cut off.
Cinsbury, who sold their 281 drug business to the owner of the Leeds Farmesi, has given up this new advice.
The company has announced that by adding a billboard ring to a skinny brand, Lloyds will play a role in this project, including La Roche and Vissie in four doors.
Paul Mills-Hex, a business manager at Censbury, says: "We have changed our minds to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also developed a highly trained staff who will be present to give advice.
Our brand's Range is designed to meet all kinds of needs, and we have now become a reliable goal that will scale the old ways of a chain."
Peter Jones 'Agnasherma' was rejected from the 11 million pounds of Holly Wiloby.
To focus on the new agreement with the TV interview, the Wi-Fi Marks and Spencer and the ITV, Peter Jones dell's life-style brand of Peter Jones's Lifestyle Brand.
There's no time in Wilobir's hand for their home assets and generous brand-duty trolly.
This is compared to the gineth paltro group brand.
This Moringer's interview, 37th, reports on his departure.
Holly Wiloby Dragons Dunn has praised Peter Jones by withdrawing from their attractive lifestyle brand business at last – which is intended to focus on his new contract with Marx and Spencer and ITV.
It has been announced that when Jones became a "fire" in the Rague, when a meeting of his business forces in Marlo of Bakinghamshire, in the morning, he admitted that he had no time for his new share — worth 1.5 million pounds — he had no time for his home supplies and care-free brand-Truley.
The business was compared to Ginnetah Pattro's group brand and expected to double the amount of 11 million pounds of Wilobir's assets.
Wiloby, 37, after reporting his departure from Instagram Truly, left Britain on the jet plane for the rest of his day.
One of them said: "Truly has been on the top of the list of priorities.
It was part of his long-term future plan, which was the financial means he needed for the next few decades.
The decision to reject him has given all of us a moment's notice.
No one could believe what happened last night, the project was about to start very soon.
There's a bunch of pieces in Marlo's passport that are made for sale."
Experts believe that a representative of Dis Moning, one of the most reliable branches in Britain at present, could lose a million pounds of the farm because they have already started out of the kitchen and have developed a great deal of money, such as furniture, clothing, and housing, and will contribute to this loss as far as possible.
And this could end a long day's friendship.
Three children's mother, Wiloby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been with Jones and his wife Tara Cap.
Wiloby started his tour with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones as a meeting on March 52.
There are 40 per cent shares in the media in the United States of America in the United States, including China, China, China, China, the United States, the United States, and the United States.
Will be the Brand Ambaseder of Wilobi and will replace Anton Macpartlin as the representative of the ITV's IM as the representative of the Selibre event.
"We won't comment on his business London yesterday night."
JULl Talk 'After Abang We'll Love '
He protested that the North Korean leader had a radical attitude and that after a comment, some people would think it "non-presidential solution".
Why did President Tramp leave so much?
The tramp calls his wife a "messenger" company.
"I didn't leave anything."
He knew that he wanted to meet Kim the second time after their first meeting in Singapore in June, and the tramp asked for a great way to organize their first meeting in North Korea.
But there's a conflict of control over the situation.
After more than three months of Singapore's conference, North Korea's capital, Democratic Rei Yong Hoo, announced to the world leaders at the general meeting of the National Union of Shadows that no "related response" of the United States to North Korea's pre-historical approach is seen.
However, he said the United States has banned the use of force.
In his speech, the tramp expresses even more creative views.
"We are in a good position with North Korea," he says.
"We were facing war with North Korea.
It could kill tens of thousands of people.
Now we have a good relationship."
He claims that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have led to creative results – which have completed the rocket test, has helped free the prisoners, and has helped the rest of the American workers to return to their country.
And he supported the extraordinary point of his talk about Kim.
"The presidential solution is very easy to behave, but instead of putting 10,000 people out of this village and trying to get in here, only 200 people were standing here," the tramp pointed out to the right person.
In Indonesia, Sunami and an island that killed hundreds of people on the ground
After the Lombe earthquake, for example, foreign public organizations were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the people in Lombe have been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, which is an advance for international aid.
"In so many areas, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, that's what Challenge is," Mr. Sambong said.
Although a group is gathering to go to Christmas, foreign workers are still not sure if they can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the head of the National Crime Organization, says that the situation of the Indonesian workers is critical to determining whether foreign organizations will be allowed to participate in the event.
The country is also mentally prepared for this type of earthquake in the wake of the regular earthquake in Indonesia.
Despite the construction of the Sunami Security Centre, it is important to meet the security centre in other maritime areas.
Despite the warning situation, Sunami's warning is not clear in Siren's eyes, it may have influenced life after Hani.
As time goes by, many islands of Indonesia's island Challenge.
You've even represented the natural abuse communication system.

President Joko Vidodo Indonesia's development of the state-of-the-art atmosphere in Indonesia has been central to his election campaign, and he has developed a pool of money to create roads and roads.
But before the next year's re-election, Mr. Joko has taken action against the government.
Mr. Joko is also suffering from the long-term civilisation of Indonesia, where Muslims have adopted more protective lives in their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed among Christians and Muslims, and more than ten thousand were homeless, killing two groups of people on the streets with gold and other red weapons.

The new form of the series 'History Rewrites' image of the series
The image will be removed by virtue of many cultural and religious scandals in England after the destruction of many religious and religious persecutions.
But the Cromwell Society has ignored Mr. Crick's advice to "record" and "historic attempt".
The representative of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was necessary to ensure that Oliver Cromwell's image was taken out of Westminster's palace in the current struggle for the removal of the image.
An iconoclasm or an act of destruction during the War of the English House was not produced by or by Cromwell's order.
In the past century, his early work of Tomas will have been destroyed by the wrong Cromwell model.
Sir William Hamo Thorncroft's extraordinary model of chromwell's 19th century comment and a part of a historic story that many think is worthy of inspiration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sande Teligraf: "Many people consider Cromwell to be the guardian of the forces in the face of extreme pressure, in his regard, against the pressure of the government – which is now under the influence of the least human beings.
But it's part of the ongoing historical debate whether it was a complete picture of that time.
What is certain is that the 17th century conflict has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known writer who represents a step in this section.
As Lord's protect, his money is fresh and worth remembering."
It's too much sugar, and it's killing the Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a South-West China village attacked a black farmer and killed him.

Bret Kavana's audience has seen more than 20 million people
Christin Blazi Ford, who accused him of sexual assault against the Supreme Court, found more than 20 million witnesses on Tattan Utbek's six-month-old television network in the 1980s.
On this point, political opposition is underway, the speakers stop the regular event due to the recent summer of February, a contract made by Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake, who will be given a week's time to prosecute Motabek FBI.
Ford Sinnet told the Judiciary Committee that he was quite sure that Kavana would hand in his body as a member of a High School party and try to open his coat.
Kavana tells a full witness that he is quite sure that the event did not happen.
It is possible that more than 20.4 million people in the Nile report have seen this action on Friday.
The company counted the size of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
The other networks that have developed the process were not available with the number of viewers including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Exchange Networks.
And Nilesen is usually in trouble with the quality of the viewers at the office.
The number of viewers of the program was equal to the number of football players or academics.
Fox News Channel, which strongly supported Kavana's opinion by the representatives of the event, is the largest audience of 5.69 million viewers in all of the news networks this day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.

He had set his head in front of the protesters for a few minutes, which led to CNN directly.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kavana is telling the truth to the country?
He's said, "You have the power, when many women are helpless."
Fleck says his office has given a report and before the elevator is closed, he says there's something else he's saying in the committee's hearing.
Later, when Kavana's opinion is taken by the Judiciary Committee to vote in favour of the entire Sinnet vote, all cables and promotional networks are being developed directly.
But Fleck said he would vote in this case that the FBI would charge against a person who was concerned about the number of democractors who came next week.
After Flake's reign, his conversation with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Conon had a partial effect.
After talking to Con, Flek talked to a few more senators and agreed to his decision.
Flake's decision was broken, because it was clear that the Republicans had no vote to approve Cavana.
The president tramp Kavana launched an FBI attack on charges.

Protesters continue their activities but have to go to different roads.
Sixty-eight-year-old Narciss Termis, who is a powerful employee who participates in protests against the dissidents with his wife, says he is no longer hopeful about the benefits of Catholicism.
"It was one of the good times of our lives for eight years.
I'm glad to be able to vote, I've seen my parents come to see the water, but now we're arrested."
Despite the important but decisive victory in the country's elections in last December, Katalan's liberation groups have fought to keep their pace where many of their famous leaders and recently waited to be elected or arrested for their organization's role in the announcement of freedom.

Menger Gole Wins 1-0 in Livingstone against Rangers.
Dali Manger's first goal in Livingstone is to win.
Steven Gerard, a member of the Ibrox Club, has been awarded the second prize in 18 games, with the support of the influential Livingstone Rangers.
Dali Manggar was a bit distracted because Gary Holt's team joined the hybrids in a second round.
As a result, the group of Gerards won the prize without winning the prize and will face the horrors they face, which are eight points ahead of them.
Prior to this, the European League will welcome the Epidemic Viena of Renjars.
Livingston, who hasn't been able to win the party in the last month, has already had six streets where they've been in the divised.
Livingston has a lot of wishes against their unwarranted opposition.
The Holts should have been ahead of them long before the attack, since they had created all kinds of problems for their aggressive thinking Rangers!
Scott Rubinson went on to save, but his efforts failed, and Alan Lithgo only managed to run his work on the video and then slide to match the head of Craig Hallett.
The guests may have been surprised by the fact that the guests were allowed to play in front of the Rangers themselves.
And that's the key issue.
Renners has a free-cooked concierge and opens the Livingstone Gole's food to set up Declan Gallagher and Robinson Manga, which he stole from a pocket box center.
On this occasion, Ranger's claim was that they knew about the welfare benefits of the volunteers, and the complainant Liam Kali has spent most of the time.
This was also the case, even though Alfredo Morlos had set up a piece of cell.
Scott Pittman was taken to the foot of the Ranger's guardian Alan McGrigor and another set of Piss jets for Livingstone from the Lithago Way.
The Crosses came to Livingston Box and became a clandestine, although the two panes' request - option Glen Middleton - was charged for the Hallet's challenge and for the Handballs.
‘ Unfaithful ’ review of Livingston’s experience
Alasider Lamant Toni Macarney Arina, Scotland
Livingston has a wonderful perspective and results.
To someone, they were too weak to expect everyone to leave at their peak speed.
After his return in the spring, he changed his style and played a lot, but after his visit to Holt, he agreed to join the group.
He was very rude.
Captain Halket was amazing, made a poorly organized defense, and kept Manga Condson and Jo Warl at all times.
Even though the Rangers were low.
They're as good as they were under the ground.
They didn't want to say their finals - only once they opened up welcome - and it's a warning for Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Egyptian inscriptions in Erdogan Colon
On Saturday (September 29th) the Turkish and German leaders were very pleased with the situation in Berlin for Braxite.

Arizone of the Grismmundian Subcontinent has been affected by an accident, but it seems to be the same for the first week, when Hariken Roza, along the south-west of the Murum, will fight with his remaining strength along the coast of the Arctic coast.
In the south of the West Arizona and in the south-east of New Caledonia, South-East California, and Utta, the Finnish, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Saltlek City cities have already released Flash Wash.
It is hoped that Roza will be able to reach the river directly and toward the end of the summer.

People outside the nest can be blessed with the rose’s fruit because the fields are fertile
Even though it is very important to be concerned, it is likely that some of this growth will be beneficial, even though the situation in the south-western part of the world is currently worsening.

The storm forces the view of the sea in the Middle East.
Thus, it is expected that Mexico will be hit by a hurricane in the summer or at night
The part of Mexico may also be a wildflower, which produces a remarkable bond.
"It is possible to grow from North-Westphalia to 10 inches from California."
Roza will sail north to Mexico, before reaching the Arizóna border, and enter southern Yutat, near Mexico, before reaching the Arizona border.
"The main disaster that is expected from the end of Roja is that of Baza California, North-West Sonora and South-West Murum in the United States," according to the National Park.

Nugroho reported that the disaster could be even greater in a region near the center of the earthquake, located 300 miles (1990 km) north of Palau.
The contact said, "It's gone completely without any information."
More than 30,000 people live there, "Red Cross has reported in a report, and has added that workers and volunteers are going to the damaged area."
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be worse."
Sunami Palu was criticized for not giving this information on Saturday agency, even though the workers said the bugs had arrived at the time of the alarm.

China West: This is his name.
R.A. Caine West keeps his name on the floor.
He announced this change on Saturday, he wrote on Twitter: "An organizationally-known Chinese West."
West, 41, had known this name for a long time, and he used it as his property.
This change of name was revealed before he was present in the satellite Night Live, where he hoped to develop his new album Yandi.
The event is said to be replacing Gaíica Ariana Grande with the event, which cancels the event "for the sake of reason".
West also said that the word to her is religious, and that it is the short name of her current pager.
At the beginning of the West year, the radio operator Big Bang said in discussing the album's title, "I believe that 'yes' is the most important word in the Bible, and the meaning of 'you' in the Bible.
"Well, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It is said from China that, which means only one person, this reflects our good, bad, our differences, everything.
This album gives our knowledge a great deal."
He is one of a few of the world's actors who have changed his name.
Son Combus is known in different ways as PF Dad, PD, or DD, but this year he announces that his name is more popular and more popular.

In the United States of America, two people should be commended for their artistic wisdom.
As China has become more and more active in artificial intelligence, two studies have been conducted in the United States and should be carried out in this area, according to researchers and developers, Ki-fu Li, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This statement has come from various parts of the government, in the United States, declaring that there is an organizational crisis of understanding in the United States.
China has already launched their new project last year: its goal is to spend 1 in the field of natural wisdom in the year 2005.
Lee further says, "Two budgets will be a good start in the research of artificial wisdom, where most countries are too late in this area and we are looking for further steps to progress in artificial wisdom."
Two people in the United States can double the potential for great natural wisdom, Li said at a meeting given to CBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Ol Superwars: 'China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order', is the leading president of the Houston Miflin Harkort, the most popular art organization in China, Fes++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Melen worked in a creative intelligence system that won the top American player, and later he was a member of the Chinese chess team of the Microsoft Research Institute.
The LI project of improved research, like the Robertix Challenge, acknowledged the US government's ability to decide the next step.
In the United States, researchers in the United States are often making it difficult to win the government award, Li says.
"Chinese academic leaders don't move; corporates do," Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other professional organizations have organized speakers from universities to work in artistic wisdom in recent years.
Li said the changes in the housing policy could help increase this effort in the United States.
"I think Green Card should be sacrificed automatically to the PIC," he said.
China's State Council of July 2017 announced its next creative wisdom development plan.
China's National Institute of Natural Sciences, such as the people of the National Sciences Foundation and other government organizations, spends money on American researchers, but China has reduced the value of academic work, Li says.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has set up a joint charity centre, which is linked to the participation of students and students, and has announced the election committee on the wisdom of the White House.
And this month, DPRK announced a 2 billion-dollar transfer on behalf of the AI network.
As NSF, it currently spends over $100 million each year on scientific research.
In the meantime, the American law, which tried to build a National Security Commission on Art Wisdom, has not progressed in a few months.
The Macedonians voted in favour of the change in the country's name
A group voted in favour of a change in the name of the people of the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step that would resolve a few decades of conflict with Greece that prevented the efforts of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a country named Mesedonia, is represented by a representative of its territory and has led to the entry of NATO and the European Union.
On the basis of a new name proposed by the two governments, the opposition nationalists believe that the change will improve the national identity of the national population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the election and had doubts whether the tournament would meet at least 50 percent in order to be valid for the election.
The question was, "You have the Nato and the members of the European Union with the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change in the name of Prime Minister Joran Jaev have expressed their appreciation for the European Union and NATO's valuable contribution to the country's most important prosperity in the country from Yugoslavia.
"I have come to vote on the future of the country today in Macedonia to save them from the European Union's youth because it means safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska Skopje.
While not required by the law, members of the associations said that they would accept the outcome of the vote by decision-making.
In order to change the name, a set of digits must be positive.
The government Election Commission says 1 Nagad has no news of anonymity.
However, only 16 percent of the national elections in 2016, compared to 34 percent of the 2016 national elections, were voted when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I've come to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said a presidential bishop named Josie Tenevsky.
Prime Minister Joran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife, Jorika and his son, Dushko, voted in favour of the change in the name of the country, which will open the way to join the NATO and the European Union on 30 September, 2018.
Vladimi Kavadarkov, a 54-year-old in front of the Skopje parliament, prepared a small area and kept tea in front of those who were to be expelled.
"We are on the side of Nato and the European Union, but we don't have a service door, we want to get our heads up," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we are poor.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian regime."
Prime Minister Jaev said Nato would make the necessary changes in Macedonia, with more than 20 percent of the poverty rate.
"I believe that the bill will be counted because more than 80 percent of us are citizens of the European Union and NATO," Zave said after giving his ball.
He said that a "yes" result would be "the certainty of our future."
A survey published last Saturday by the police director of Macedonia said that 30 to 43 percent of the votes in the polls needed for the tournament will be included in the vote below 30 to 43 percent.
Another tweet directed by Telema TV in Macedonia, plans to vote 57 percent of the respondents.
Of these 70 percent said they would vote yes.
There must be more than 50 percent more votes to succeed.
In the past May, unemployment will be the first death penalty under the Western Government's law after power has been seized in the last month.
Look: Serjio Firero Gole from Manchester City to the entire Brighton Defense
On the historic stage in Manchester, England, J.B.D. left Serjio Fire and R.I. Sterling, between 2 and 0 of Shanber Manchester City, U.S.A.
In 65 minutes, Guerreo made it easier to see his score.
At the beginning of the Siquiens, a passage was found in Midfield by Argentina Striper.
Before he left, he ran into three Briton defenders.
The four blues of Jersey fell to the fire.
Before leaving more than a few others next to the Brighton box, he turned to a defender.
Then he put a foot on the left, which he found Sterling.
The English feeder, using his best shots in the box, brings the ball back to the fireplace, which the British guard Matthew Ryan used his right button to hit on the right side of the train.
"A fire is fighting some problems with him," said the City Manager's Pope Gardivolla.
"We've been talking about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're glad he was a thief at once."
However, Sterlingi Skye Bloz gave priority to the fight against the Prime League.
That ball came in 29 minutes.
Aguero played a key role in that game in the Briton region.
He sent the ball to Liray Sen on the left side with a beautiful path.

Beat the odds in a poker-style dice game
After removing the Nationals from the play-off debate, there was no reason for anyone else to start.
However, Shire's rival leader hopes he will mount Rubber Colorado Rockies, but only if the L.A. L.A.D. is affected by the Wan-game leader.
On Friday night, Rakis won between 5 and 2 against the Nazis and won the Wild Card at least, but they still want to earn their Farst Division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can get on the night with the Danver's viewers and the other group probably know that this year I'm looking forward to playing at the top of any point.
Why don't I want to argue about it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Wednesday, but it is said that the Sherzer can be put in such a situation.

When he spoke of the importance of the Republican Votdan in the central election, the president made a brief comment on the situation of the security situation in his Supreme Court, Bret Kavana.
"All we have done is in November.
Five weeks away from our most important election in life.
It's a big, big -- but I'm not running, but I'm really running because I'm fighting for poor people," he said.
The tramp said, "You see this fear of Democrats, a radical group of fear, you're seeing it happen now.
And they have the strong promise to regain power in any way they need, you see this mildness, kindness.
Those who are attacked, who have to go after them to gain power and control, they don't give anything, they just want power and control, and we won't give them it."
He says the Democrats are on the "convention and ban" mission.
"But you've seen it in the last four days," he says, calling the Democrats "failed and low and poor and untrustworthy."
He has named the Democratic Senator Dian Finstein of the Senate's Judicial Committee, who received a high-ranking ticket from visitors.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you fake the group?
Oh, oh, whoa.
No, no, I'm waiting--it was really bad old Langues -- the worst bad old Langues I've ever seen."
Leber is no longer a free organization.
Those who think they're not helped here by what they think they're doing.
When my local party's MPs accused me of voting, it wasn't like it would be an accident.
Because, you're not welcome to talk about yourself here -- I'm the last one on the list to let you know.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan had the same attitude because he stood firm against the Jewish research.
In my case, I was held guilty of having sex with Jeremy Cobbin.
With regard to the importance of a clear economic policy, Europe and national security, and the like, which Germany did not agree with the former leaders.
"We want the meetings to be meaningful and creative," said Ntingham East-Leber Mittingi.
In my eight years as a local Lebar empi, this first Friday night was the first time I met.
Unfortunately, today, it is not a safe meeting and the promise of "Dalu, Mardhu" politics has been long forgotten, if it really ever begins.
It has been extremely important that the Liberian party is not used differently and that each opinion is decided on whether it is acceptable for collective leadership.
It was just after the German leader, that I started to think with my colleagues that I knew the same kind of political viewpoints they wanted to take up the U.T. and to take a position that I would not be king in any way - whether national security or the Yeu is a player.
When I speak openly – and even if I don't get anything to say – there's a call to remove me through social communication, the centre's politics is condemned, and I'm told that I shouldn't be in my lab party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more involved than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I've been given are also political.
I have been disappointed that all of my employees who are exposed to the scourge of discrimination or verbal abuse on the basis of daily relationships have never been able to drink their passions and ideas.
How the most tragic turn of politics is how Galagali's independence has become normal
Jeremy Cobbin claimed last week that Leber's party should pursue a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a voluntary organization and join the change in the vote or election.
For the past two years, I've been given many suggestions to keep my head down, not so good, and I'm either "right" or "right."
But I didn’t want to go to politics to do that.
When I attended the Leber School 32 years ago, the Thachar government gave us a chance to destroy the categories of our extensive school, I tried to provide the necessary government service to those who needed it — whether as local council or government ministers.
I never kept my politics secret with the last election.
No one in Ntingham East has ever been confused about my policy and the areas of conflict with the current leadership.
For those who have preached this campaign on Friday, I will only say attukuy that when the country moves towards a bridge that will destroy families, business organizations and our people, I cannot understand the need to be loyal to the leader of the Liberian party.
But I don't really have a message for Ntingham Momentum, it's to my electoral centres, whether or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise I won't stop me from saying what I believe is the best thing for you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Resurrected at the head of the uninterrupted air
In the past two attempts can be made to reduce some of the immediate results, but there is no doubt that this day's outstanding outstanding tennis champion, Mace Air, was worthy of victory.
They are now on the top of the table, only one group of ten.
In the end, it was their good defenses, just as well as their ability to take the opportunity, which helped the welcoming group to win and which was the proper reason for the joy of Cos Peter Murski.
"We've been tested every game so far and we're still busy, so I'm going to be happy."
Melrog's Rubin Cristy says: "You have to credit Air, they have done better than we have done."
The 14 - minute effort of Grant Anderson, moved by the French climate, led to an accident, but a Hollywood card from the Scottish Player Reese, who was released by Wariss, gave Melrose a digital rating and attempted a failure by Jason Baggot.
Climo Panalty was trapped in the air, just before him, at the time of the Haftim, and he went on a 17-5-minute walk.
However, Melrose started out well at the beginning of the second century, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to transform the bagot into five points.
A long time ago, the game was stopped for a major hit on the street, which had become a strategist, and many more went on after the game started again with the Stifford Macdoval attempt, which had transformed Climo.
Aer's influential president, McFerson, told the added player of the Méloroz's move to the air at the end of a series of deadly pressure.
Even though the volunteers come back correctly, and when they see the cloud card for the climate, without saying, they go back to McFerson to the bottom of the line.
Climo again turns out that Kyle Roo was blushing David Armstrong's box and sent Henry Henry of the Franks Gregger out on the back of the home side.

'The sea is ours': the earthquake Bolivia hopes to open the way again to the Justice Minister
Nabikra gives a reging cold Christmas party to La Paža.
The public buildings are opening up a massive snowfall.
From Lake Titicaca, the capital, "The Sea is our right"
It is a recurring task ""
All of Bolivia's citizens are still aware of the fact that a blood-thirsty war against a blood-thirsty rich in Bolivia is still going on – yes, it is also a chance to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the most in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice on 1 October five years after the discussion.
"Bolivia has that speed, one-and-a-half warning, and we certainly expect results with a creative view," Bolivia's Kuwaiti Rourto Calzadilla says.
Many of the Bolivian Isis will see a large screen in the Ruling Country, hoping that Hegg's Tribunal Bolivia's claim that - after a few decades of discussion - Chile Bolivia will be forced to discuss a sovereign outlet on the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's Carishmetic President - who will face a controversial fight for re-election next year - has much to do with the summer.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some researchers believe that there is no way to decide on the Tribunal's Bolivia -- and if that happens, it will be easier to change.
The Dutch National Association does not allow Chile to land and has announced that they will not determine the possible outcome of the discussion.
Isisje's radio, which only came six months after hearing the press, points out that the case was "not a joke," says the Chilean International Law Specialist Page.
And it can go back to four more years than it's going to take on the cause of Bolivia.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the access to the sea," Zerete said.
Moralse's anti-war speaker, he said, is the encouraging news that Chile has brought about.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to speak for a while, but it will be very difficult to discuss later.
The two countries have not been transferred since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzi, denied that the decision of the Court of Justice was inconceivable.
Sombar Bolivia's "a wonderful opportunity for a new yoghurt with Chile" and "to end the 139-year-old conflict with each other".
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - the most popular Latin American president - Meritium Isuti is still using it as a political quest.
"Never leave the right to enter the capital of Bolivia," he adds.
"The opportunity to see that we're going to have to cut our last."
North Korea says the United States will not be allowed to trust the United States.
North Korea's Prime Minister Reyong Ho said that if Washington can't believe it, his people won't set up a military weapon first.
He said this on Saturday at the general meeting of the National Union.
He called on the United States to proceed with what he promised at a summit of the opposition leaders in Singapore.
His comments seem to have been in the process of relaunching a low-performance quota more than three months later in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong-Wan, the US Prime Minister.
Rey says it's a "pypy Drem" that ignores the bans and pushs North Korea to the US response to the announcement of the end of the Korean war.
Washington warns that Pyongyang may be opposed to the announcement that he does not take the first steps to be made.
Both the president of the United States and the president of Kim and the United States want a second convention.
However, there is a strong argument that Pyongyang is the only way the country can guarantee its security.
Pompey wants to launch Pinging in the next month for the second Kim-Tramp meeting.
Paris Face Shoes publish the last line of the Great Leader on a Hei Street near you
If you want to grow your top collection or block the sun completely, you don't need to see it again.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown Ranway have developed a series of cross-sectional head guitars for their SS19 collection, which has given the style set to the Paris fashion week.
In this Greek, the most unusual top-up instigrams have been chosen and the designers have sent their eyebrows to Katwa.
Valentino's greatest creation was an over-the-duty top bee tip, which was set up with a wide channel like a ball, which was put on the top of the models.
Among other ovarians, there is an anarrhythmia, including an anarrhythmia, which is not designed to keep your head up.
Tom Browno published a selection of both eyebrows - and Halloween at the right time.
Many colored faces were like Hannibal Lakes, as they were in a terrible taste.
A creature with a snorkel and goggles looks like someone who's got an ice cream.
And if you're going to keep the big facsimile report, you're going to split up.
Stylish monitors predict that big benefactors can go to your high street.
Outsided tweets protesting 'La Bomba', two-foot-long-banded shells that have been seen every time from Riana to Emily Latazkovsky.
In addition to the social media, Calt Label Katwa has sent another huge creature - a string-by-bag that is almost the same as the model of the satellite camera.
The Amalian Rafiya Bag of the La River of James19 was the first to be painted with Rafia Frining and with a white hat handle on his head.
Selebriti Stylist Luke Armitez said to the film: 'I hope that tomorrow there will be a big top and united bogs in the future in Hi Street -- the design because it has so much impact on the overseased young people's desires.'
John Edward: Language Skills Needed for World Citizens · Global Voices
The free schools in Scotland have placed a track record of the academic achievement, and this has resulted in a more unusual test in 2018, which is strengthened by the efforts of the deaf, the arts, the music and other peoples alone.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, the Scotch Council of Independence (SSIS) has tried to end these schools to their students and parents at the best level.
Foreign schools aim to prepare their students for their places as well as for their choice as citizens of the world.
As a learning area that can be used in a particular school for reading and application, we see today's language as a matter of preference.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, it's in his head.
If you talk to her in her own language, she'll be in her heart."
It is a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
As a result of this year's latest test, we see that languages are on the top level in the foreign school with the most advanced standards in the League tables.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students have earned a higher grade.
A total of 744 members of the ASIA's school have shown that 72 percent of students in Mandarin have contributed to higher grades, while 63 percent of the students in Germany, 69 percent of French students and Spanish students have also contributed to it.
This proves that Scotland's foreign schools support foreign languages as an essential skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
The language is now being conducted in the same way as the publications of the International School of Foreign Affairs and elsewhere, such as the STIMs (knowledge, technology, technology and mathematics).
An evaluation of the EU Commission for Implementation and Skills 2014 showed that 17 percent of the respondents had given up their language skills to fight in the dark.
So more and more, the language skills are growing to prepare the young for their future career.
These skills are needed in a worldwide world where more language is needed to enable them to work.
If people choose careers, if they are learning a second language, they will be able to live with their livelihoods in the future.
A multilingual person is automatically able to communicate directly with people from a foreign background.
According to more than 4,000 adults in the U.K. in 2013, a survey showed that 75 percent could not speak well in any foreign language at the time of the conversation and that only 15 percent of French languages were spoken.
That is why language education is important for today's children.
A number of languages, especially the language of developmental economics, will give children a better opportunity to find a place of work.
In Scotland, each school will have different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others who appear to be the most important of the U.S. language, such as Mandarin or Japanese, can be seen on the other side by 2020.
Whatever your child wants, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from foreign schools, with specialized education staff in this area.
The Scotish Foreign Schools are committed to a learning environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the necessary skills to succeed whatever will happen in the future.
It cannot be denied in the context of global business that languages play an important role in the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "International Communication Skills."
Foreign schools will offer these tastes, art and excitement to the young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.

In San Diego, he's going to take a break at Lake Lebron.

The time at which the last sentence of the tramp is located, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp took up the campaign in West Virginia's Huiling tonight.
It's the first five weeks after the tramp with Tama in a friendly location with Tennessee and Mississippi.
In order to ensure that the Supreme Court's election is complete, the tramp aims to provide support for the next mid-term election, since after voting in November, the Republicans are in the grip of losing control of Congress.
How long has the West Virginia meeting been tonight, and how have you seen online?
Trampe Huiling, West Virginia's meeting, is scheduled at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the West Virginia entrance to the lower tram through the YouTube Live Stream.
The tramp will probably say this week about the hearing of the Supreme Court's president, Brit Kavana, who was raised in the wake of a expected synth vote on sexual abuse.
However, the main goal of these events has been to help the republics to make a few paces for the elections in November.
Thus, President Tramp's statement says that the aim of the five-week Ally was "to force supporters and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their digitality under the Sinnets and delegates," Reuters said.
"Congratulations control is so important to his agent that the president will move as far as possible to the Kingdom as possible with our entry into the occupied media," said a news reporter in the name of the silent tram.
Huiling, appointed for Wesbenco Arena, today's conference "may bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and give coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Since last Saturday, the tramp of West Virginia has travelled twice this time, which the Kingdom has won over 40 percent points in 2016.
In front of the tramp election, the West Virginia Republican Sinnet's petition is trying to help Patrick, who is behind the scenes.
According to Reuters, political leader Simon Header of West Virginia University said, "It is not a good thing for Mary to try to raise her to election," he said.
Rider Cape 2018: Team U.S.
At the end of the three-unit session, it was necessary for the driver's head to be held on Saturday.
The Pandolam of Momentum is a full-fledged, but players really believe in it, and most of the national competition.
So where are they going now?
"They were a six-point leader and now it's four, so I think we have a simple moment," Jordan Speth said to leave for that day.
Europe has access to, of course, four points forward to the rest of the board.
As Spith said, Americans think there are some help in their journey and they can be encouraged by much, especially the form of Spith and Justin Thomas who have played all day together and have taken three out of four points.
He was mortal from the beginning to the end and was leading from the front.
He was even more cranky when he and Thomas were behind two points after playing his rounds, and it was as important that he took the four-point ski masks.
The same kind of joke that Matty had won was his 15th floor, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team isn't out of it.
"You really have to go deep and think about your mask," he said.
Each of these players is already in the same game.
18 holes for a mark.
More than two days ago, Spith and Thomas were the only players who found more points than Francisco Malinary and Tommy Flytwood, the founder of the radar cap.
The horrors of Europe, however, cannot be made by four and no mistakes.
"Molud" was the only juice that didn't shoot a bogey in the morning, but they left the bogie in the afternoon morning, Friday and Friday morning.
The race, and their power, seemed to be moving towards and from this excited crowd, seemed to have no more potential players, except Fletwood or Malinary, who won the European victory.
It's good if both of you are in different grades at the same time.
Although European pride goes away from time to time.
Bob Watson and the Web Sympson had some problems in fighting with Alex Naren, and he had to do something about the morning's morning for the Foreball Nike Serjio Garsiya.
In the first nine, a bogey and two double Spaniards and Sweden were placed in a cave where they could never get up.
On Wednesday, though, there's no one to get you out of your chest.
On the other hand, mutual falsehoods, which they recommend, which do not advise, and which can change with caution, are very exciting to see from near forums and forums.
Europe has been playing well as a group so far and has taken an important lead on the final day, but the forum has further demonstrated that the team of U.S.s has had some doubts about the fight.
On the final day of the radar cap, Europe has taken 10-6 led
On the summer day of the Rider Cup, the European health will be made available for 10-6 months against the United States of America from Saturday's Forsam March.
Encouraged jute Tomi Fletwood and Francisco Molinari have now taken their talisman to four points in the Gulf National, leading to twice the victory of the Tiger Woods, who are in two dogs.
Two years ago, the European team of Thomas Jenn was fighting to recover the lost traffic in Hajeltin, which had won the battle against the wrong American road in the morning.
The U.S. has offered more opposition to the U.S. victory, but they have not been able to complete it.
To restore the traffic, we need eight points from the 12th Mass of the Sunday, Jim Furic's group.
The first European Rocky and he and Malinary, together with a wonderful week, was the first four-point football player in the history of the Rider Cup from the first four-months.
When Woods and Patric Rid were thrown into the Forecloss, they forced Uds and the American Ruky Brown Dekambeyo to be more heavily defeated by 5 and 4.
On Saturday, two Macheys had a flash of light among the waves that had taken him to take him away, but now he died in 19 Machey and Tana seven between his Forebol and Forsam on March 29th.
Justin Rose, a break for tomorrow's forum, came back to the Henryk Stanson, a member of the Forum, to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cooper's 2 and 1 p.m. - one and three world numbers.
In the south-west of Paris, it wasn't for Europe on the day of the war, even though it was for itself.
The three-year-old winner Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas set up two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 powerful victories against John Ram of Spain and Jan Potter in Forsama and returned to the police and R.M.M.D. 4 and 3.
A group of four points has returned from the crash just twice in the history of the Rider Cape, even though the only way to recover the Turkish road traffic is to recover as soon as possible.
After two days of being a second good, Yayok, it seems to be going to throw them away.
North Korea says "No way" will not be organized simultaneously without faith.
North Korea's Prime Minister Senibar told the National Union that the existing ban on the United States continues to deepen distrust and that in this national situation, there is no chance of leaving the country's military weapons at all.
Reyong Hoo of the World's Annual Meeting said North Korea had taken a "remarkable positive approach" to shut down the environmental and environmental tests last year, to break the environmental test, and not to increase the scope of environmental technology and environmental weapons."
"But we have not seen any similar reactions in the United States."
"If there is no hope in the United States, we will not have any hope for our national security, and there is no way to unarm ourselves in this national situation."
Although North Korea's prosecutors described the "level" approach to R & D of Westington's "level" approach to North Korea that it would be punished for taking long-term action in North Korea, his statement was so complete that he didn't give up on the situation at the same time, since Piingingang has done it too.
R.12 stated a joint statement by the President of the United States and North Korean leaders at the first conference of Kim Jong-won and Donald Tramp, when Kim promised to work on the "opportunity of Korea's recommendations" and when the trauma provided security guarantee for North Korea.
North Korea is looking for an organizational end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first abandon his military weapons.
Washington, North Korea, also represented the invitation to participate in heavy international bans.
"America" has stressed the importance of arms-first and has increased pressure on the bans on their financial goals, even against the declaration of the end of the war," Rey said.
"The bans can put this idea in our head, a different dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ban on religion is making our faith stronger."
There is no comment on the purpose of the Second Summit between Rím and Tramp, which was held in the United States for the first week of the week.
Instead, Prime Minister Mohodi said in the last five months, Kim and South Korean leader Mun-Jan said: "This is the issue of disarmament if South Korea does not become a United States, but the Korean opposition is not so in the process."
However, Rey's speech was quite different from last year when he told the U.S. general physician that the US original land was being tortured by North Korea rocket when the "Mr. Eville President" tramp said "Rocket Man" accidentally.
In this year's nation, the tramp, which threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim for her courage to take the lead in the siege, but said that there will still be much work to do and the bans will continue until North Korea is destroyed.
The smart tramp said there's no time limit for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three or five months, there's nothing going to be there."
China and Russia agreed that Beijing should be sacrificed for the steps taken by the U.N. Security Council
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey also announced to the Americans: "The Security Council's bans must be effectively enforced until we have fully checked-in restrictions."
Security Council Piinging has been raising restrictions on North Korea since 2006.
Pompey's general secretary of the National Association met with Rei in the assembly and said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the Second Congress.
Pompey has already traveled three times this year in North Korea, but his final appearance was not good.
When he left Beijing in July, he said that there was something going on, only a few hours before he was threatened by the Korean answer "like the Guandas"!
In North Korea this month, a Missile Site and a Nuclea complex had promised to meet with Mon, if the U.S. "like system" was accepted."
He said that Kim, who was looking for "several ways," was the security guarantee provided by the tramp Singapore and brought to normal contact with Washington.
Harvard students are getting enough rest.
In this year, a new class of the Harvard University of Copenhagen-Georga offers all its fans more sleepy ways to read the "night" of the "Tazzaga" at night."
One student found that a number of university students in the world are often confused about how they will take care of themselves with very basic things.
Harvard Medical School's medical professor and Brigham and female hospital professor Charles Sicilar, who believes this is the first time in the United States.
After giving a talk about him, he asked to start the course.
‘At the end of that, a girl came to me and said, ‘ Why did you tell me this today, my secretary came to the yard?’
He said that anyone or anyone ever told him about the importance of sleep-- which he accused me of, 'he told the telegraph.
As early as this year, this course explains how the students contribute to the best academic and athletes of sleep, and it also explains how they need to improve their general health.
The teacher of Harvard Medical School's mental health and the director of the World University Health Service, Paul Bareira, said that after the students left the university, they decided to run the course after a week of important sleep.
There's a job in the course for an hour later.
In one section, there is a picture of a school room where students click on coffee cup, screen, teacher and books to learn about caffeine and light effects and how the Athlete is affected by the loss of perfumes and the importance of a bedtime routine.
On the other hand, participants are told how long-term sleep disorder can be associated with heart attacks, strokes, shocks, and cancers.
A map of the Campus with an interactive icon, and then the participants are excited to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - such as your decision to eat cigarettes, but also the right to know about the health effects of it, 'professor Cicilar added.
He says that the culture of pride is still available, and he adds, that smoking is a major problem due to the pressure of modern technology and students.
A student should be a 'secret weapon' to fight against stress, climate and anxiety, who is sure of your good quality sleep, he says - even if the shower makes the bedroom a mess, they're upset."
The 19-year-old Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old scientist in California, helped design the course for Professor Sicilar, also took a class during his first year in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and gave him a follow-up for a Campas-Wide course.
Next, he hopes that before joining the opposition, he will ask all the students of the Snatokota to complete such a status program.
Professor Sicilar suggested that when students should go to school and when they should go to school, they should consider setting up an alarm clock and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'Nil Ala' by various screens and LED lights, which may have destroyed your Sardinian wall, thereby causing problems of going to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: King of the Hungarian Golder students.
The Elomelo team of Steven Gerard, Dali Manger Gole, has been assigned to Livingstone for a period of from 1 to 0 years.
In the St. John of February, after the victory of 4-1, the team of Ibrux looked forward to another victory, but the group of Gary Holt offered him the second kingdom of Gerard as the 18th March manager, which took him far away from being Horts in Ledbroke's prime capital.
The menga had been hit seven minutes before the Haf-time, but the expected Rangers Line-up could never give them their truck.
Renjars has now gone down to the station, Livingston has risen to the third place, and has left Hibernate on the other side of the globe.
And there may be further problems for Rangers because of the fact that there is a need to treat Lensman Calam Spain for something that is too difficult to control.
The German team changed the eight that lifted the air to the roof of the Battfried cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the 11th Lviv who took a point from Horts last week and his team was proud of how to resist the opponent.
Well, if Ranger says he can be a leader, but Livingston tells them that he's doing more than that.
The manager should only score two minutes if he sent Scott Pittman to the Le-of Alan McGrigger's cave for the first time, but the Midfielder lost his great chance.
A long-term free-goed president, Craig Halket, of Kahan Jacobs, was able to kill Alain Lithago, his opponent's only back post.
While Renners' control was renewed, they hoped more than believed in their game in the final court.
Alfredo Morlos must have felt that his panel should have been found in the Quarter-Away because of his and Steven Lalse's conflict, but refrey Steven Thomson called on the Colombians.
Renners may only be awarded two shots on the first round, but the story was often read by the chief of the SBBBs, Liam Kali Lasana Kulibali, and OV Algerian Shot.
Levy's 34-minute campaign may have been against the game source, but no one can deny that they are the same player of this game.
The Ranger Jacobs' drop-ups failed again.
The Decan Gallager's speech to Scott Robinson did not give any response, but he held his head to pick Menga for ordinary finishing.
Gerard arranged for a meeting with Ryan Kent to replace Kulibli and the group was about to work because the Hungarians were in the Moorl, but the extraordinary Kelly took him from the line to the block.
However, the Livingston visitors started playing the right game, and litho and Halkette sent a long message after they said it was a long time ago.
The Holt's team could move on to their lead in the final phase, but Macgregor's efforts to destroy the Jacobs were put to the fire before he was taken from the Lithago Corn.
Thomasson returned his eyes to the understated Glenn Medalton of the Ranger, demanding the late panel with his hat with Jacobs again.
Almanak: Director of the guitar counter.
And now a page of our "Sande Morning" Almanac: 30 September, 1822, today... the day the scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Germany.
Gigare created a method for detecting and measuring Gigare's activity, a device known as the Gigare Counter device until the end.
Since then, one of the basic sources of science has been the basis of a father’s culture, the guitar counter, in the 1950s in the "Bels of Choronado" film, which appears to be the most likely of all, scientists Ray Rajars and Del Evans, as follows:
People say, "What is it again?"
Rogers: "It's a guitar counter, such as the U.S., used to find T-shirts.
When you take these phones, you can hear the effects of the data provided by the media."
Evans: "Is that a lot of words?"
"Hans" guitar died a few days before her 63rd birthday in 1945
But his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can help identify weak cells in the immune system.
The new cancer vaccine can help identify and kill weak cells of the immune system.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect weak cells as part of a doctor
In this way the anti-smokers are released from the disease and the lab is involved in changing them.
After that, many can have a simple "right" protocol for cancer and then re-enter.
A test vaccine has shown promising results with patients of various levels of cancer.
A woman who has been treated by the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect the poor, has seen the cancer of her democracies disappear for more than 18 months.
In this way, anti-smokers are taken from the disease, converted to the test so that they can see the normal protocol of many cancers called HER2 and then are forced to re-enter the cells.
"Our results show that we have very promising vaccines."
HER2 describes the professor's Barzfsky in an increase in cancer of various types with Brest, Demobush, Fusfus and Kolorectal Cancer.
It has also done the same way to treat the disease against the cancer cells outside patients and "how to prepare cancer cells" as well as to treat them "screaming" in Luxembourg.
After a MAGA summit in the Canary Islands, the Canadian West UN has joined the pro-tramp debate.
It didn't work.
Kanye West was placed in the studio after a difficult performance in the Satrade, where he praised the US president Donald Tramp, who said he would be in peace even in 2020.
After performing his third night song called Ghost Town, where he had a Mac American Great cap, he attacked the Democrats and renewed his support for the tramp.
When I speak to someone white, they say, "How do you like the tramp, he's a traitor?"
Well, if I was curious about the divorce, I'd come out of America a long time ago," he said.
With an unexpected scan, UN-MAT Damon began to enjoy a witness from the Senate's Judiciary Cavanague witness to the motion for sexual harassment by the Hollywood Association of Christine Blazi.
Although it has not been published, West's football player Chris Rock social media has posted it.
It's not clear whether we're trying to introduce West with the rock post.
In addition, West soldiers accused him of having a problem with the Bakstage in his head.
"They put me in the backstage.
They said, "Don't go out after the tape."
They made me laugh!
And then they say I'm in a deep place, according to Washington Assaminar.
West says, "Do you want to see the place?" Says he'll read his Superman hat, because it doesn't mean what you're going to say to me. "Do you want to see the world come forward?
Then try with love."
His comments were made at least twice from the audience and members of the UNL Coast widely argued, stating that there was a person who said, "There was a punctuation in the whole studio."
West was taken as an option by Gaika Ariana Grand, whose former lover died a few days ago.
In the form of the West Ii Lav It song, many are sensitized as the Peruvian boots.
West Security Group TPUSA has been supported by the main channel of TPSA Turner, who tweeted: "One of the saddest souls: Thank you for standing up against criminals."
However, Toxo's representative Karen Hunter tweeted that "the West was what it was and he's too weak."
"Then I chose not to punish someone (supporting his music or poetry or his "ship") who conceals and spreads the destructive view of my people.

The game of Thorns Lake Kit Harington was attacked by the toxic masculinity or the dispersion of a man.
Kit Hington is known for his military role as a Fantasy Series Game of Thorns.
However, the 31-year-old actor Maso Niak said that the national role on the screen meant that it would be difficult for young children to get their support.
When he was talking to the Sunday Times, Kit said he believed that something was wrong, and he asked how to solve the problem of the toxic masculinity in #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Lesley, a companion of his game of Thorns, admitted that he felt strongly about the problem at the age of 31.
'I personally, I feel very strong, right now -- where are we going to go wrong?' he said.
'What did we teach them when men grew up, that we are now facing this problem?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the growth of the Texcculinity for too many male characters.
He said, "What is the secret, and what do we learn?
What is taught on TV and on the street that children feel that they should follow this particular path if they are to be men?
I think it's really the biggest question of this time -- how do we change it?
Because it's obviously some big mistake of the boys. '
At the meeting he further admitted that when the series in the next line would be renewed, he would not make any game of the Thorns profile or stream, he said he ended the life of 'war and race'

HIV/AIDS: China's new events have increased by 14%.
China's HIV and AIDS attacks have increased by 14%.
There are more than 820,000 people in the country, the Helth Officers say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, almost 40,000 new events have been reported.
Most of the new cases were due to sexual harassment, which has changed since the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly across China for blood-threatening operations.
In this way, however, the number of HIV attackers is almost zero, Chinese officials said at a UN country conference.
Although every year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000.
A serious problem in the public's economy is the HIV-based Elgibi of China.
While China was legally legalized in 1997, Eljib is still considered to be a cause for discrimination against people.
Because of the country's security values, it has been estimated that between 70 and 90% of men sex with men and then marry women.
Many are victims of the scourge of the disease in this area of sexual security.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised that this problem is part of the Mokabela's efforts to cure HIV.
Maxin Waters ignores data from GPS sensors, 'Binding Lies' and 'Frequents'
The United States of America has denied the claim that a member of its staff posted personal information on the Wikipedia page of the legal agents of three republican American senators.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these claims are published by the "Altra-Rite Wing" and are published on the website.
"false, false, and even more hateful lies," Waters tweeted.
The information published includes the address and phone number of the U.S. Senators' homes and the address of the U.S. Senator.
This information was published on Wednesday online, an unknown person posted during the hearing of a Sinnet Panel hearing of sexual abuse against Brit Kavana, a petition from the Supreme Court.
After the three senators questioned Kavana, the lie came in a few minutes.
It has been reported that the IP address of the post's source was connected to the Waters office and that some members of the Waters employees reported it.
"This baseless charge is a complete lie and an innocent lie," Waters continues.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been raised as a result of this jealousy and false charges - were not responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless charge is completely wrong and an innocent lie."
Waters' description of White House's early press like the former Air Flasher on the Internet has found a lot of answers.
"It's unacceptable," he wrote.
"It says he's not supposed to be a member of Congress.
When anyone is accused of something they haven't done, they won't complain.
They're not going to be divorced.
They should not be questioned about the purpose of the accused.
They must be peaceful and productive."
Judge Kavana compared the reaction of the Democrats to the response of Fischer, who was thought to be very small during the Friday night.
Republikan's prayr Omar Navaro, who chose to study Waters in the middle of the election, has also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's big if it's true," he tweets.
In his report, Waters said his office warned the authorities and law enforcement agencies about these demands.
"We will make sure the criminals are exposed," he said, "but their laws will be legally binding on any member of my staff and all the members of my staff for all their destructive and destructive deeds."

Lebar admits that it creates four days a week for Briton, but it will be rewarded for five days
The Jeremi Kurbin's Leber Party will consider a basic plan that the British will work for four days a week, but it will be paid for five days.
The group wants to report that the company's owners will share the money that workers spend with more than one day's income through the climate of natural wisdom (I) revolution.
It will see workers enjoying three days of work - but it will still be paid in the same house.
It has been announced that this idea will be 'fit' with the group's economic mission and plans to move the country to the country.
The Trade Union Congress has approved a four-day transfer as a way to allow the economy to change.
A senator of the Leber Party told The Sunday Times: 'There is hope that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen at night, but the four-day workdays are an evening of hope that the group's team's team's efforts to protect its financial resources will be successful.'
In support of this national opinion, the first Lever Party, Green Party, promised four days of work during their general election campaign in 2017.
The invitation is not currently supported by the Liberian party, however.
"The four-day working day party is not a principle, and it is not considered by the group manager."

In Lindsey Graham, tell Canadians "60 minutes" if they can change their mind from Kavan's FBI.
The FABI has slowed down a week's notice of the Supreme Court's charges against Judge Bret Kavana, and has raised questions as to whether any Republican senator can back up their views.
At a meeting on Wednesday, the "60-minute" reporter Scott Pelley Republican syndicated, asked whether the FBI could do anything to change their mind.
Kennedy was more popular than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavana.
After this incident, I called him, brought the charges out, said, "Did you do this?"
He was strong and firm."
Graham's vote, of course, seems uninterrupted.
"My patent has been created and a very important charge needs to be changed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bret strongly rejected it," said Christine Blassie Ford, adding Graham.
"But they couldn't check who she called them.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be Global Sitting Festival, an annual musical event that has a rough line-up of the years and a equally exciting mission; the end of the world's poverty.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will not only see thousands of people return to the central park in order to enjoy such activities as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Son Mandès, but will be alert to the actual end of poverty in the year 2005.
Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, which is an international group that hopes for an increase in the number of people who are actively engaged in combating poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to give money for the VIP ticket), a number of activities or "activity" of the consergians have been done to help you raise awareness of their target when you have an e-mailed student, call a phone or other difficulty.
However, how successful has the Global Citizen been in maintaining his goal for the rest of his 12 years?
What is the real way to encourage people to act through a concert, or another case of the so-called "clicktivism" - where people think they sign an appeal online or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it's recorded more than 19 million of its supporters, leading to various targets.
It says that these steps have helped world leaders to make a record of $37 billion promise and legislation that will affect the lives of 2.2 billion people by the year 2005.
By the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 30 promises and declarations that began from its workshop, including at least 10 billion dollars already being distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the safety shield has still affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
A few of the basic commitments are to be reached by the U.S. fundamentalists, and the participants of the U.S. fundamentalists are committed to "encourage children to their full potential" and promises to provide $35 million to Rwanda after more than 4,700 of the Global Citizens' Twitter account is reached.
"With the help of the U.S. government, the donor, the national government and the Global Citizen, we can achieve social injustice in the past as a piece of history," said the President of the U.S.
The group further said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken in the United States to raise mothers and children, the government announced financial contributions for a project, the Dwarf of New York, which will eventually reach 5 million women and children.
A question asked on its website is, "What do you think we can end poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and strong way - we will never read and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and counter-terrorism campaign before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the window, Son Mendes, Cardie B, General Monica New York will be among those who will make the most of this year's events, which will be conducted by Deborah-Le Frances and Yu Jacobman.
US Russia's Zablani Rufftani can use the ship to "stop" the ship - sovereign
In the Middle East, Washington can secure his ship's safety in order to attack Russian aliens, U.S. inside the United States, according to the Washington Inspector's description.
Jink claimed that Russia's fighting in Syria - notably, where it works at the government's invitation - is a challenge to see the new Japanese game around.
"I believe that it is because of their former position that they want to improve energy like the southern centre of Europe," he said.
And according to the authorities, there are ways and means to accept it.
He said, "The United States has the power to keep the sea open with our vessels and, if necessary, to prevent them from playing in order to make sure that they are not going to play."

Moscow Bar pointed out that 11 billion US dollars's North Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the available pipeline's capacity, is ready to take 110 billion cubic metres - a fully financially-skilled project.

"In my belief, we agree that Zablani cannot be used as a force for pressure and should have the power to take over the citizens," Russian Prime Minister Alekjand Novak said after a meeting with US Prime Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
As a result of the US's position in Germany, a negative reaction from Germany has again been confirmed against the German project.
The German Federation of Foreign Affairs (BDI) told the United States of America to stay away from the bilateral agreement between the European Union and Berlin and Moscow.
"Angela Markel of Chancellor of Germany and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, after the recent meeting of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said that we have a major problem with a third country in our area.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that after the internal election, he would "see" the petition for the president for himself.
If a tone of the Holocaust of Massachusetts, Warren is convinced that he is in opposition.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and correct the government that read us and that includes women's involvement," he says.
"After 6 November, I will call the President in protest."
Warren Town is in the process of protesting against President Donald Tramp, saying that the tramp is driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very curious about what Donald Tramp is doing with our country," he said.

18 The UK supports the New Security Policy Challenge
The Department supports Inni Challenge against the new U.S. government and District A. Colombia, who refuses to protect the victims from gangs or family violence.
UNBSI News reported that in order to support a lawyer who announced the principle, 18 representatives from Britain and the district gave a free-of-the-art briefing to the Washington Supreme Court.
The full name of the White House, which was issued in August against the American Civil Liberties Union Federal policy, was not published in the Grace V. Mamley session.
He said his song "But his violent gang boys" gave him a joke, but the US workers rejected his security call on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The Athenians of Grace's supporters set the example of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as a country where the problem of gangs and family violence has been faced with, from where the number of people who call for security in the United States has grown.
The 2014 decision of the New American Security Council, Apple Board, to allow unsubstantiated citizens to apply for protection from family violence.
The District of Columbia's Attorney General Carl Resin, in a statement, says that the new principle "has ignored the sovereignty, federal and international laws for many decades."
The French-Abd-Court Brief says, "All citizens' requests for information and status should be judged by this federal law and this national ban is contrary to the basic purpose."
In the report, Attorneys further argues that the principle of non-acceptability of citizens is being violated in the US economy, because they are more likely to be victims and they are "sustaining the necessary rules."
Attorney-General Jeff ordered judges to refrain from providing victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Religion, religion, nationality or political opinion in a particular social group is prohibited or protected by fear of those who have to leave their country," the session announced on June 11.

U.S. government has accused China of "galagali" by "propaganda Knowledge".
An American press accused the US press of using a campaign against China's American state Beijing, a week after publishing a statement to the United States of China on four pages.
The U.S. President Donald Tramp of Iwa's best-known Chinese Deanic Des Mins Registrar's pay supplement, and China's US Congress elections on 6 November, has rejected the complaint.
According to the trauma, Beijing American elections are attempting to interfere with what US officials say in Washington a new attempt to force China.
It is a natural event that the foreign government will make known to the press, but Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in the business war, which has resulted in increasing the amount of money they have contributed to each other's contributions.
Chinese and American experts say that the war was designed to destroy China's most powerful victims, such as Iwa, who supported the party's republican republican party.
China's US statesman and Iwa's former-day Governor Terry Branstad, who is a major producer of agriculture in China, says Beijing Americans have damaged the economy, farmers and businesses.
In a letter to the Dice Minins Register in Branstad Rubber, China says that "the pride has now doubled with the knowledge of our own rebellion."
Brenstad writes, "By learning how to give money to the Das Mins Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the anti-corruption and the history of the free media of China."
"On the other hand, on the way to Beijing, you will find a limited anti-constitutional meeting in New Zealand and you will not see the reality of China's serious economics which may be at odds with China's people, because the media is heading for China's Communist Party."
He added that his letter "has refused to print a major newspaper in China," even though he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
The Republicans want to keep the debate away from women voters before the midterm, researchers warned
In the face of a number of charges of sexual assaults against many of the local republics, the Supreme Court's prime minister, Brit Kavanf, warned that they would find an answer to the opposition from women particularly in the Middle East elections.
The issue has increased rapidly, and most of the republics seem to want to continue voting in public already.
In a post released on Saturday at the University of Syracuse, Professor Grant Rihar of State Science at Maxwell School said to Hill, "They can't come back in any way."
Rihar says that the pressure of Senator Jeff Flek (Ar-Arizona) to the FB is likely to calm the pressure of the press for the moment, he is skeptical.
"Women will not miss what happened tomorrow and November," says the leading adviser to the progressive Movan group, as the magazine Washington D.C., and national female photographer Karen Jean-Pierre.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christin Blazie for the Kavanf's opinion, the judge's decision to continue with the judicial committee's decision to continue the protests on Saturday morning was "November!" Slogan said.
"Nindian political researcher Stu Rothenburg told the site," the media's media and media account will end.
"People say there's already much more; it's true.
However, it may be even more, especially among women aged 18 to 29 years of age who do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even prior to giving a witness to the people of the Ford against a petition against the Supreme Court, researchers suggested that if the Republicans were to proceed with their consent, they could be reparated.
"It has become a critical issue for JOP," the former National Committee of the Republican National Committee said last week.
"It's not just about keeping the committee's vote or the final vote or the Qafaff, but about how the Republicans have taken the matter and how they have used it," said the Preoritis U.S. Group, who helped Democrats in the vote, their director Goi Cecil told channel.
However, it seems that the Americans have some doubts about who to believe before Fords and Kavanf's testimony, and then the people are concerned.
A new survey in Yugoslavia has shown that 41 percent of respondents are sure to believe in the testimony of the Ford, where 35 percent say they must or may believe Kavanf.
It has also been shown that 38 percent said that they thought Kavanf was lying or probably lying when he received his witness, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flickr, FABI is currently accused by Deborah Ramirez, a report by the Guardian.
Ford testified to the judicial committee's sworn oath last week that he had been dismissed by Kavanf Nash at the age of 17.
Ramirez accused him of having sexual relations with a party while he was reading the 1980s Supreme Court of Nominee.
The World Wide Web aims to initiate a new Internet initiative to connect with Google and Facebook.
The World Wide Web has launched a launch to compete with Team Burners-Li Fesbook, Amazane and Google.
This is the last project, inrapt, a company to create a source platform slide to be created by Burner-Lier.
Slid users have the right to choose where their data will be stored and which information will allow them to access.
In an interview with Fast Company, Bernards-Li Russiantizes that Inrapt's real purpose is "World Authority".
"We must do this now," he said about Startup.
"It's a historic moment."
This app allows all to create P and D or "Personal Online Data Stores".
It can include contact lists, Todo lists, Calendars, Music Library and other private and pager tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsft outlooks, slots and spectifs can be found in all of the same browsers and the same.
The other thing about personal online data storage is that it will fully rely on the user - it can access any type of data.
Company called it "the personal power through the data."
The idea of Inrapt's idea, like Siovan Bruce, will help bring all the resources, processes and appropriate skills to get the balance.
The organization is currently building a security platform for Bernards-Li, Bruce, IBIM, with a group of dedicated non-stop developers and software codes.
This week, professional developers worldwide will be able to create their own focused applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Burnars-Li said that he and his team would make a complete change with Facebook and Google where the model of all their business would be completely changed at night."
"We don't want permission from them."
In a post of a media post published on Saturday, Burnars-Li wrote that the Inrapt "the purpose of the inrapt is to protect the integrity and quality of the new website on the slide"
In 1994, Bernard-Li Mascusets Institute of Technology established World Wide Web Consortium and changed its value to the Internet.
In a few months, the network security debate has emerged as a powerful coalition of Bernards-Li.
This key will also be used as an agent and director of the Bernards-Li World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I look forward to this future youth on the Web," Bernards-Le adds.
Bernard van: The Victoria Cross Clearing of the First War · Global Voices
Adi's century inspired the only winner of the Church of England, who won Victoria Cross during the first world war.
Lieutenant Colonel The River Bernard Van Purscher won the attack on Bellengles and Lehancott on September 29, 1918.
Anyway, he was killed four days later by a terrorist and he never knew that he had gained the highest respect in the British Empire.
His two daughters in a Cuscawaze in the Rushden, Northamptonshire, reflect his memory.
His daughter Michael Van says it's "exceedingly" that his dad's death is happening 100 years later.
According to London Gegett, Lieutenant Colonel Van of the 29 September 1918 "leaded his battalion through the wave waves of Guang Kushaa and Falde and Mechingan" in the time of the Saint-Quantin Channel.
Then he went to the Firering Line and led the line with "Serbow Courage" and followed the line with only one field song and gave three enemies a shot.
Lieutenant Colonel Van Van was killed by a German terrorist on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, says his dad's actions, "It's something I've never been able to do and what's brave."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Cuscawaz, were taking the lead in the Brandwood Imperial Youth band.
Michael Van says, "I understand fear of paradise," and he adds, "There is an increase in the growth of truth in support of the people of the world."
M.M.s had spent all night looking at 206 blotos, but they had found Pope Pig instead.
Imagine that you haven't been shown all night long to see a good ballatter 206 and the original event.
The original bill from San Jose was 13 feet with six feet and the entire night live on Channel 5 in the U.S.
Early in the morning, when Gegard Musasis and Reri McDonald were preparing to face each other, the Coverage turned into Pope Pig and killed the visitors of the United States.
In particular, they've been up to their knees for this party, so some people are tired.
On Twitter he described a child-friendly cardboarding as "one kind of non-racialness".
"They were forced to bring children to court on the ground at 6 a.m. by the government's rules," Mr. Dave Shuarz said about the question of the question.
"Papa de Pig," yes
Ballato's organization meeting Scott Koker says he will work on creating a schedule for future U.S. visitors.
"We may be able to solve it in the time of the repel," says Koker.
"Then there will be six o'clock in the morning, and we will not be able to do this until they are gone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was dried, a big message came later, and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise it won't happen again.

It's a terrible situation."
Dezart Island Disc: Tom Deli has lost "infinity" due to sexuality.
The Olympic Diver Tom Deley said that he was embarrassed at growing up because of sex – but it has made him successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't know before he went to high school, "They're not like me."
When speaking of the first radio presented by Lauren Lavarn, he told the Irish disc that he spoke about the right of the others to give "a chance".
He added that after the birth of the child, his Olympic victory was undermining his mind.
Christy Yong, a regular representative of the ongoing event, has taken several months to get away from the illness.
At Lavern's first event, Dale said he understood the rest of the "small" because "the children's favorite was not socially acceptable."
He said, "To this day, that little feeling and feeling different have actually increased my strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove himself "something" so that when everyone could know about his sex, he wouldn't be sad.
Two-time Olympics were won by the Brindisi leader, Hei Hei's profile algibi, and in Australia he worked on his presence in order to invite more countries to acknowledge the Commodity in this year's Community game.
He said he had opened his eyes, because he thought he could live openly without trouble and wanted to give others hope.
This three-year-old champion says to read a man's love -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he was shown in 2013 -- "I was surprised."
Deli married this score winner over 20 years ago, who said there was no problem with ageing.
"When you were so young," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died three years later in cancer -- he said that it was difficult to find someone who was so old that he could see it as soon as he could.
The couple gave birth to a son named Black-Dele and said that his "all-view" had changed.
He said, "If you asked me last year, I said, 'We have to win a gold medal', that was my idea.
"In fact, there is more to the Olympics than the Olympics.
Ruby is my Olympic composer."
His son's name was Robert, who died at 40 years of age in 2011 in the Moscow cancer.
Dale says that his father never admitted that he was going to die, and he was asked whether his ticket was secure for London 2012 - because he wanted to stay in the first row.
"I've never been able to say, 'You're not going to live in the first row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when his trust was stopped, and until not until he gave up his trust and died, and I didn't admit that he wasn't innocent," he said.
The following year, Deli participated in the Olympics and won the bronze race.
He said, "It was the dream of my whole life -- to give the Olympics to their viewers, it's not a good feeling."
It also attracted the taste of his first song - the hair of Hadar Smel - which was followed with him in the preparation of the Olympics and which is still playing in his song.
The BBC Radio 4 is on theDazart Island Disc Wednesday, 11:15 BS.
Upfront, Michaelson is sitting next to the radio station on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson Rubber will play his 47th radier cap match, but if he doesn't want it to be a bad Milton, he'll have to get his form back.
Michaelson, who is playing the 12-year-old record on this double event, has to live in Bench in the forum of Saturday and Forsam instead of Captain Jim Furrick.
Instead of staying at the Hall Hall centre, which he was playing in the United States, the 5-year-old champion has lost his job and ranze's job.
The 48-year-old driver is not suitable for the golf national course, where the long ruff often hit the long-distance track.
And if the course isn't bad enough for itself, Michaelson, 9th March, the British Open Championship French Mollinary, who has won their four match this week with Ruki Tommy Flytwood.
If the Americans who are at the beginning of the 12 singles match are able to start well, Michaelson's match can be proven to be important.
Furic showed confidence in him, even though he didn't say much.
"But today he fully understands his role, puts his hand on my back and says he's ready for the day," Furic says.
"He has strong faith in himself.
He has given the team a lot of things in the past and in the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I hoped more, but that's what happened, and we were thinking about going this way.
He wants to name the ground, like everything."
The greatest player in the field of Mace Michaelson in the Rubber game will be released by the Best Rider Cup match record.
It can be held in a radar cap in Korea, which is not even able to record its personal records.
Michaelson's team has 18 wins, 20has, and seven havens, even though Furic says his presence awakens Tim.
"But beautiful people, amuseds, wise men, love people, like being in a team room and a good person," he says.
"I think the new players have enjoyed playing with her this week, which is very good to see.
He's just giving more than the game."
The European Captain Thomas Björn knows that big lion can be invisible
Thomas Björn, European Captain, knows from experience that the radar cap can be created in Senegal on the last day of the Great Lid.
In 1997, Deen's suicide occurred in well-being, where Savi Balestero's leading group won five points to the Americans, but in March, only one of them won the Finnish line in 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You must remember that we were a great leader in the good people; our great leader in Brooklyn, where we died, and in the good people where we won, but in the name of the good ones," Bjorn says, he is seen in the picture, last Saturday and last two days, from 5-3 in the 2018 class of Gluff Nazial.
History will show me and all the team that it hasn't ended yet.
It's been a long time with great enthusiasm.
Get up and do the right thing.
The board doesn't end until we get the point.
We have a goal, that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where our bird's eyes will be.
I've always said that I'm looking at my group's 12 players, but who we're on the other side of the world is a very good player."
In addition, Bjorn says, I'm glad that our players have done the hard golf course. "I'll never be too confident about this.
Tomorrow's another fight.
Time will come in front of personal perceptions, and it's a different thing.
When everything goes well, it's good to be with the partner, but when you're alone, you're fully tested as a golfer.
This message must be sent to all players, until all are done well.
Now, you have to take your companion away and bring him a better return."
On the contrary, the opposition will be watching Jim Furic to play better as a team of players, especially Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who brought three points between the four points.
In Europe, " day-to-day solo events" are part of a winning team in Har and Brooklyn, and the experience of the Nathaki-Pervertan has also been enriched on the last day.
Prior to his last name in 1999, President Ben Crense excited his players about how he said, "I remember every word."
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to get rid of it as quickly as Brooklyn and Madina.
When the game is over, it's a lot of pressure in the middle of the game.
We'll build a line-up by it, and we'll name the kids as we think, and we'll do something."
Police, Justin Roger, John Am, Tommy Fletwood and Jan Potter were given the responsibility to take the lead against Thomas against the Europeans, starting with the Mace Rory Macleri.
"I've set up this group in this order, because I think it's going to cover all of this," Buzern said about his election of the Syngloss.
A new German warship is back in power
The local media reported that Germany's newest team to replace warships in the previous battle-war was to be launched in 2014, but it will not be until one year after the fall of the wrong system and snobling.
With reference to the U.S. summit, it was stated in the Daily Jet paper that the first "Rainland-Falz" ship launched by the New Baden-Wortemberg-Seren was stopped by the first half of 2019.
The ship was about to join the ship in 2014, but the high-level project has been a problem due to the problem of Deleveri-neighbour.
In 2007, the ship of the four Baden-Wortemberg-Serries will take the place of the Bremen-Class Frigate.
It is known that they will have a strong cam, anti-aircraft, and anti-ship software, such as Ride Radar, Infrared and Acoustic Signer.
Other important features include long-term maintenance - new frigates can be modulated for more than two years from the country's border.
In any case, it means that there are so many warships - which will help Germany in the demonstration of power abroad - will become old when the water is named, the news of the Day Jet.
Last year, the F 125 frigate came to the title when the German shipping agency refused to launch the ship and sent it back to Hamburg's Bloom and Vos Schipeard.
This is the first time that a ship is sent back to Shipbilder after the ship's delivery.
The reasons for the delay have been very low, but the German media points to a number of important "software and hardware errors" that will cause the ship to abandon the war.
The waves of the software are particularly important, because the movements of the Baden-Wortemberg-class will be managed by nearly 120 Nabiks - which is among the people of the former Bramen class.
In addition, it showed that the ship would be too heavy to lose its capacity and would create a barrier to joining the fleet's future upgrade.
In the second world war, these 7,000 tons are thought to be twice as heavy as the Germans used in the Second World War.
There has also been a problem with the involvement of the wrong hardware, the entire project being trained by the Croesus.
The first level of 2.2 billion pounds has reached 3.1 billion pounds (3.6 billion dollars).
In the recent context of the warning of the collapse of Germany’s nuclear technology, new frijets have become increasingly important.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bertells of the German Conservatives Committee admits that on the ship, "Motane's proper ship is flying."
The worker says the problem has spread over time, because no replacement ship has been taken from the former ship.
He regrets that no ship in Baden-Wortemberg-Serge was unable to join the ship.

The organization has set up the first and only dedicated third-party storage place in the state of Dumfrage and Galloy, where the ten-member population of Scotland is located in eight countries.
Estet Manager David Thompson says this is an ideal place for tourists.
"There's a good place to stay here in Trive," he says.
"There's an old building here, there's a lot of old trees and all of them have a good place.
But we still don't know much more about foreigners, so we'll help us understand what we need to save them here and elsewhere."
He stresses the importance of knowing that there is an abortion prior to the maintenance of the property, because it inevitably kills 400 women and children as a result of the destruction of a mother’s home, and can guarantee the full number of abortions.

Ronaldo refused the prosecution and the lawyers went against the German press
The charges against him are described as "false news" that people want to raise their own "crisis" for his name.
His lawyers are ready to take action against the German News Magazine of Spigel, who have published this complaint.
In 2009, a hotel in Las Vegas accused Portugal and Juventas of accusing an American woman named Catherine Mayorga.
Against him, he was accused of giving him $375 000 in order to keep silent about the incident, which was recorded in the report of the Schubar Dr. Spigel.
A few hours after the announcement came, Ronaldo, 33 years old, commented on the report when he spoke to his 142 million followers in his Instagram Live video.
"No, no, no, no.
They're telling lies today," Balan-D-O said to the winning camera on Friday.
"They want to develop their own contacts using my name.
It's normal.
My name means they want to lose their own, but it's a lifeblood.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well." The player added.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file charges against Dr Spigel, whom they claim to be "an unquestionable report of secretity".
Legal Christian Sheltz says that the player should be "one of the most important of personal rights in recent times" for moral damage.
The event was reported in Las Vegas in June 2009 at a funeral of Pams Hotel and Cassino.
According to the paper delivered to the National Clark County District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go to the home of the player, where he is subjected to pressure.
Maiorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo acted in harmony and told him that he was disappointed by "99 percent" "good people", "one hundred".
The document claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that they were having sexual intercourse, but it was controversial.
Mayorga further claimed that she went to the police and was taken to the hospital with a picture of her attack, but later she became king outside the court, because she was "fashioned by fear" and was afraid of being "infamous".
The 34-year-old said that he now wants to repeat the sentence, because he has been mentally disturbed by what happened.
Ronaldo Manchester was in the process of joining the Royal Madrid Unit during the crimes committed, and in Greece, he joined the International Club of Italy for $100 million.
Brixit: The U will 'unsuspend forever' to be the car manufacturer
Foreign Minister Greg Clark says that the United States will be the first to build a car in the world after Brazil.
He added that it was "depressive" that U.S. Taoto Bibsky told the U.S. that if he leaves Britain without a contract, they would temporarily stop producing their factory in Darby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that if it is broken, it can go to work for a limited length of time.
Burnston's factory - which has created Toota Aris and Avanis - has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with nearly 90 percent of which have returned to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain and the Yu finally came out of the market, we could end up in the city."
In addition to the agreement on how other cars built in the UK with Honduras, BM Dublin and Jaguar Rovars, there is no agreement on how other cars will be managed without the European Union.
For example, BM Dublin says they'll close their mine planet in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The basic concern of car manufacturers is that Supplies China's involvement in the unconstitutional Brexit of the Treaty is not what they say.
According to the Twitter production line "just-in-time", UK and YU are coming in 37 minutes from the drivers for the ordered car.
If the U would leave without a contract on March 29, the United States would be in a state of misery, which would make it possible to slow down and face an international crisis.
The organization says that it is impossible to maintain an inventory of more than one day's value on the dryer planet, so that production can be stopped.
Mr. Clark says that in the future, it is the Teresa May's promise of a relationship with the U.S. "It's done well at the limit."
"We need a deal. We want to make a good deal that will not only keep us successful, but also enjoy the possibility of future progress," he says in a bibby Radio 4 event today.
"It is not just the tea, it is also evident that the success of Supply China is essential."
It is impossible to say how long it will be to stop production, but they have failed to reduce the capacity of the longer-term charge factor and can lead to much work.
A 24-year-old worker and the Union of the planet's abbot Peter Suvalaris said his members are alarming: "If these things happen to me, they won't come back again.
One government official said: "We need a specific and reliable plan for the future with this U."
Howit House announced that the tramp meeting with Rojanstein could be delayed
In the middle of the Supreme Court's Nomini Bret Cavanf, Donald Tramp and Deputy Atterni General Rod Rojosstein announced that the High Parerth meeting could be held "after another week" and that Rubibar Hoyette House would be "after another week".
In the election, Russia's supporters, the supporters of the tramp and Russia's possible connection and the decision-making process of Special Adviser Robert Mueller.
A few months ago, Dr. Deputy went to Washington, D.C., asking whether he would abandon the Attorney General and through him whether the Moeller's freedom would be questioned.
At the beginning of this month, Russia reported on the possibility of removing the president by 25 October to record his conversation with the New York Times tramp.
Rosstein rejected the report.
However, he went away and reported that he went to the White House last Saturday in front of such a report.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting was held on Thursday afternoon, when the trauma was due to the National Union.
Tramp says he "do not like to divorce Rosstein", but Kavanf and one of the women accused of sexual immorality against him, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, both of them witness at the door of the Senate's judicial committee.
A week's FABI ordered a week's charge against Tramp Kavanf, for which the full vote of the entire synnet was delayed.
The press secretary of the tramp is a member of the press-scretary of the Sander's office in the Fox News.
With Rosstein, he said about Miting: "No date is right, it may be this week, it may take another week for all the other issues of the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I always want to tell the media."
Some journalists will oppose this report, and no press briefings have been made in the White House since September 10th.
Agent Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders says it's not "show people" to journalists because they don't have a briefing, but he says, "I don't believe they've done what they've seen."
He then suggests direct communication between the tramp and the press.
"The current president has more questions than any previous president," he says without mentioning any kind of evidence: "We have judged that number."
And in the future, there will be a briefing, Sanders says, "but news media is much better to talk to me if you can ask the President of the United States directly.
We've been trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a few weeks ago and have been talking directly to the President of the United States in the area of press briefings."
The tram takes a regular question when attending a meeting or an interview with guests from the White House.
One journalist's conference is very low.
New York might have seen the president this week why it is possible to do unplanned work and sometimes to see things in front of the press group.

Health Minister N.S.S., Scotland, thanked the European Union for its work and expressed a desire to remain in their seat in the future.
Jean Freeman M.S.P., U.S.A., sent a letter less than six months ago.
The Scottish government has already promised megabs for the State of the U.S. government to work in the territories of the country.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: There is a debate between Yuk and Yu on the whole of Greece, which can be expected to result in this conflict.
But the U.S. government is also preparing for possible non-contractual situations.
I know you're all going through an alarming time.
That's why I want to remind again how important their contributions are to me, especially the nationality of each member of the staff.
The entire European Union and its staff have brought with them valuable experience and skills that have strengthened and improved health care and have benefited both the patient and our community.
Scotland is your country and we want you to be here."
Christian Ebarkrombi's real weapon against the head of the cat
Tenesy's Mike Organ reported that the Tenese State Tigers' Liner Christian Ebarmby has been heavily armed in the head of Mace when he was wounded in 31-27.
The president of the state of Tennessee, Coss Red Red, told reporters that the attack had taken place some time ago.
Reed says, "He's come to Sydney to read as much."
Teachers and medical staff gave Ebarmby an oxygen at the Sydline and then brought him back for further tests.
In Nashville, Tennessee, a member of the tennis club, Dablu SMV has told Chris Harris that he was outside the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that "no description of the type/type of the attack is yet to be found" and Tennessee State is trying to report the time of the attack.
After moving from Illinois, Laul Shart, a second-year-old student, is playing the first time with Tennessee State.
Before he left the game, he had five motorcycles, which took 18 motorcycles with him on Saturday.
When foreign customers buy a fortune in the United States, they have to pay more stamps
When foreign creditors buy new assets in the United States, they will have to pay more stamps and use this extra money to help the homeless.
This approach will ensure the success of the Corbin campaign to attract the four voters.
This slow growth will be applied to those who don't make it to the United States.
Tražari hopes that more money will be available to help the homeless in the year.
When foreign creditors buy a fortune in the United States, they have to pay more stamps - and use this extra money to help the homeless, Teresa will announce it today.
This approach will further enhance the success of the Cuban campaign to attract voters with high-ranking and high-ranking residents.
This stamp will be used for people and organizations who are not in the United States and will have to work in the government with the help of additional homeless people.
In addition to the current stamp, it may be more than three hundred years ago in the second house and in the second house of sharing.
Tražari hopes it will cost up to £120 million a year.
In London's new production of coins, 13 percent of the U.S. foreign residents are singing, which has increased the price and has made the situation more difficult for the first-house creditors.
Most of the country's affected areas - especially the government - have become "unknown city" among foreigners.
The new principle was adopted a few weeks after the call to the House of Commons by Briss Johnson Stamp.
He accused the land of land-use non-use of large-scale construction organizations and called on Ms. Mace to cancel the main value house in order to solve the "dwelling problem" in Britain.
Mr. Cobbin announced an attractive series of proposals for a housing reform, which included extensive control and "no-flight" cuts.
He wants to give the Council more power to build a new house.
Miss May said: "For eight years I said that I would restore my prime ministry to British dream - which should be more beautiful for every new generation.
And that's what it means to be in trouble with the house-to-house.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and live.
However, it cannot be said that foreign and foreign organizations that are not in the United States will easily become as rich as British citizens.
Many people have gone far from home's dream, and the problem of homelessness is real.
Jack Ross: "My urgent dream is to take over Scotland"
Sanderland boss Jack Ross said his "supplication" was a future manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotland residents are currently enjoying the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which is now in the third place in League Wan, three points from the first group.
Last month in Moscow, St. Maren returned to the Scottish Premiership to this Greek stadium.
"I wanted to play as a player in the country.
I got a beer cup and so far, say to the sports community in Russia.
"Then I grew up with my father and father in the small town of Hampden in Scotland, and it keeps me behind all the time.
If I succeed in managing the club, only this opportunity will come."
There are Dick Advoct, David Mays, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Nil, Roar, Gus Poet and Paul D'Canio among Russians.
The former Aloa Athletic boss, Burnsle and Epswis Town, said that he rejected the offer of a large club name, which he did not understand.
"This moment will be a success for me, 'Can I bring this club back to my favorite bed?'
It's certainly worth the favorite league because of the club and the beauty, "he says.
"It's not that easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as successful if I can get the club back there."
After 15 months of being a coating staff in Dumberton, Russia's manager's life is only three years old.
He then helped Alaa to recover from a third level and then to transform St. Miren from a second level through a champagne chip into a victory.
And Russia says that he is now more popular than Klyde, Hartpol, Falkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton's academics.
He recalls taking the responsibility of saying, "It was probably a real Milton."
"I really believed that the management was better for me than the game.
It's amazing to hear it because I've done it right, I've lived the car and I've enjoyed some success.
But the game is a draw
You have to go to big things every week.
I still feel the same way about the pressure of work, when the management seems right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, it's the most popular thing I've ever had in my life."

In July and the sale of bars increased by 2.7 percent, the figures showed that 4.8 percent of the income of the restaurants had been lost.
CiJ's business adviser Peter Martin, who compiled this statistics, says: "The unexpected long-term participation in the world of India is the same in July as in June, when there has been an increase of 2.8 percent of the pedophiles and a decrease in the sales of restaurants.
In June, the number of jobs increased by 1.8 percent in July.
Drinkers are getting drunk and the bars are so good and the restaurants are so bad.
The main dishes also smell hot coffee, but the restaurants don't name them under their names.
People seem to be running out for just one drink.
All can be found and drinking has increased by 6.6 percent in the month, with less than three percent in the food."
"The end of April is still missing.
The effects of the weather and major social or crisis events in the area of the house are greater in the area of business outside the home.
There is no doubt that the groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent of the annual sales will be particularly painful.
Food operators will not be able to come from a long and cold winter in bad weather and will tell them if the normal weather in August is going to bring some comfort."
In July, there will be a new challenge and a 2.7 percent increase in mass sales in restaurants, which represents a decrease in sales in brand roll-outs.

Hundreds of deaf students say they have a clear "question" account to show their parents, and they have hidden it.
One mother, who saw her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site, saw a Kisheri calling on others to "sit me".
A study of digital Avarnes UU and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conferences (HSMC) found that between 11 and 18 years of age there are 40 percent of the profiles, half of which have accepted secret accounts.
H.S. Chief Mike Buchanan says: "It's amazing that this is an attempt to create a place that parents and teachers can't find online."
Ellid Doyle Sketch Athletic Board will be "Wess for Athlitis"
At the annual general meeting of the Governor's Board, Elid Doyle was elected as an independent director of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle Scotland's most successful track and field Athlitis and Sherman Yan Bett described this approach as an inadmissible opportunity for critical managers to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level.

He wrote on Twitter: "I've had a stroke before.

The doctor said that I could say how much I could be healthy.
It was very hard work, but now I've learned to relax, and today I've started to exercise again!
Thank you for sending a message!"
The Internet is divided by the mother and grandmother in the knowledge of the Son of God.
A single bomb organization has shared the Internet's opinion with a knowledge to compare children's mothers with those who are breast-feeding.
What is said is, "The Sun's pump in the first voiceless way in the world," a popular music video by Elvis, in support of the campaign, has been released to show the freedom that the new pump gives to modern mothers.
The mother of four reals goes on a rough ride with a song containing: "Yes, I'm the second of my own, but I don't have a leg" and "If anyone sees it, it's not the left of any animal, it's my neck."
Cyrus continues: "Fill, pump, I'll eat the children, I'll blow, I'll double my bonds."
Despite the fact that the company's Facebook page has been released, there has been a debate online.
In 77,000 videos and six comments, the video has been received from Egypt's visitors, many say it reflects the "fear" of deep art.
"The worst decision to make in recognition of this plan is the worst decision.
They need to be as pregnant as we are to produce babies, except that their children are taken away from them within a few days of their birth," one writes.

Another commented: "It seems to be harmless for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them in the intelligence of the blast pump for the mother who keeps the child safe?"
Another said, "It's a very distasteful idea."
Others have stood by the theory, a woman admits that the song has become her "announcer".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I ate two kids, I wouldn't be one.
It looks like it's too bad when you pump.
It's a little crazy about knowledge, but I've taken it very well.
It's an interesting song," one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a complete knowledge that it's aimed at the mothers who smoke (which is usually in their job or in the toilet) and it's the idea of their own "groves".
This knowledge does nothing to the praise or criticism of Daily Arts."
At the end of the video, a group of women say they've all brought the bomb in their brother.
The knowledge is based on the idea that many women feel as hard as they smoke.
Although the Elvis pump is completely sound, it does not have a tube, and the Nursing bridge, which also allows women to hold their hands, keep their ears shut, and even get out of the air.
Anna Balarin, Mother's partner and ICD say: "Elvie Pamp is a biological phenomenon that should begin with courage and enthusiasm.
We'd like to take a photo of women and women's deep-rooted geeks at Sun Pamping and all its Challeng spatleys, a new amazing and related way of expressing the incredible sense of freedom.
Elvis Pamp hasn't been in the first news yet.
On London's fashion week, a mother of two children used this formula to throw Catwa for the design of Marta Zakuboovski.
Several neighbors took the child to the top of a black text limit
The number of children arrested has increased, although the monthly limit has been slightly altered, as the difficulty in the operation of the tramp administration and the policy has made it more difficult to keep the children to their sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the Spaniards are afraid that they might be in their own country without the papers and ask for children.
This trend is increasing in June when the Federal authorities announce that possible sponsors and other adult members of their families will be required to print and share the information with the local authorities.
In the past week, an expert on housing and leisure has testified in front of Matthew Albens Congress that this agency has arrested a few dozen people who have called on innocent children.
The agency later announced that 70 percent of those arrested were innocent.
"About 80 percent of Spanish or Spanish family members are illegally in the country and a large part of them are criminals.
So we're looking for them," Nister Albens says.
In an effort to bring children to a more rapid society, workers are applying new rules that must be brought to court within a month of arrest, which was 60 days ago.
Many of the guests will not personally come to the judge by videoconference calls.
Those who are considered to be incapacitated will be executed quickly.
According to security agencies and reports published by the system in recent months, children may be more anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent events or to escape.
Supporters say that there is more concern at a large centre like Turner, where children are shown to be more anxious, likely to be ignored, because of his size.
They also said that if children don't have enough time to be physically prepared or to give up their friends, many may be able to get a few of them to get more out of the train so that they are already late.
U.S., France and Turkey's 'Awake' have been told to move to Syria temporarily.
With regard to the general prosecutor, Prime Minister Walid-Al-Muelem announced that he would return to the country of Syria's citizens, even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moalem, who is also the prime minister of the country, says that foreign troops are on the ground of the country, and "We will take the right action."
"You have to go now without them," he said to the doctor.
Moalem pointed out that in Syria, "the end of the war against terrorism", where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "wars to clean up all Syrian territory" against the terrorist and the "unlawful foreign presence" both.
There are nearly 2,000 members of the United States in Syria, and President Bashar-Al-Assad is the Kurdi Army and Syrian Arab both to provide the main education and guidance.
There are more than 1,000 members from France in this war-related country.
Moilem says the situation is good for them to return and he owes "something in the West to spread fear" which he has urged to stay away from the refugees.
"We have called upon the international community and human organizations to help with this return," he said.
"They're political with the whole human problem"
The United States and the European Union have announced that Syria will not be given political assistance until the end of the war between Assad and its opponents.
Cotonians of the League say that the end of the great terrorist attack in Idlib has given Russia and Turkey the opportunity to move forward through the recent political debate through a buffer between Russia and Turkey.
The Russian-Turkey Treaty, supported by Russia's Syrian army in this area, has opposed a large number of attacks, where three million people live.
But Moalem pointed out that the agreement had "a clear time limit" and he expressed hope that this sovereign approach would work against the Jihads fighting the Al-Qaeda-Assads of France, who would be "recorded."
The nation's president Stefan D's mission was about to invite a new committee meeting with government and opposition group members to prepare for and reach the end of the war-resurrection process soon.
Moalem explained that the Syrian government's involvement in this committee should be limited to the panel's "to examine current contexts", and he warned against an unimpeded attack.

It is not surprising that the 17th vote in Pennsylvania is being held, since two prayers are fighting for a single arrival due to the rebirth of the Congressal District.
The recently rebuilt city of Pittsberg District Pitts has led the Democrat Representative to fight the Lamb of Con, who has won a special election in the past.
Lamb fought against the Republican Keith Rothfas, now represented by the 12th district of the former Pennsylvania, many of which are the newest part of the 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts are generally organized in an unjust manner according to the republics, which has resulted in the reformation of the map.
This election of the new 17th district has been in favour of raising money among major groups, Shakha Democratic Congressional Committee (DISC) and National Republican Commission (NARSC).
In the 18th Congressal District, Marche Pensylvania met Lambe after winning a special election, which was announced on behalf of the 18th Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
More than a decade has been entitled to the Republicans, and President Donald Tramp has won 20 points in this district.

Cotonists have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already approved Beijing, moving from Washington a little later.
Mr. Tramp Panama met with President Juan Carlos Varler in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, but later participants moved the team to the management of the tramp organisation.
At the beginning of the month, Hilda Nort of the Department of Foreign Affairs reported that the officials of the Dhaka decided to return from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama to the American leaders of the Kuwaiti mission.
However, only El Salvador was declared to be punished, who received nearly $140 million as an American ransom in the area of drug control, development and financial assistance in 2017.
The proposed team, which included financial assistance and a specific visa ban, could rise to the country as a result of its high poverty and death rates.
With the progress of the internal meeting, North American and Central American workers stopped a high-level conference on security and economic growth in the Americas as a way to prevent citizens from entering the Americas, such as last year.
But mid-September Nagad, government officials made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which made it possible for El Salvador to end.
Cotonists have announced that the vice president Mike Pans will speak at this conference, which was held in mid-October, in order to inform the administration of imports.
And the American angels in three countries have not returned to El Salvador, Panama and Dominic countries to receive any new strong message or punishment from Washington.

A special report by Robert Muller on possible obstacles to Mr. Tramp's legislation, which now has sufficient evidence in the public record.
It has been said that Mr. Tramp had no contact with Russia at the time of the election.
If the Congress's hand is changed, Mr. Tramp has to take over his responsibility, just as he is ready to go back to the voters and may eventually be facing his colleagues again.

What we should do if Mr. Tramp Deputy Atterny General Rod Roženstein withdraws, which will determine the part of Mr. Muller's claim.
Since its release last year, Roženstein has been in trouble with the fact that he has secretly advised the president about the recording and has taken note of his inability to do so.
Mr. Rojanstein says the Times' news is not true.
"What will be our response if the F.B.I. is to start a campaign against the Free Cavanf, even if it is incomplete or unjust - or even if there is a credible charge of sexual harassment and false testimony?

Women are losing their nightly sleep in the care of their families.
Despite how the participants should deal with it, very few people talk about it with their family members.
In a survey of Nessawad, half of participants said they were talking to their husbands or wives about the long-term ministry.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of the family to talk about them, but they don't take the initiative to talk about it," says President Holly Snyder, president of the life-threatening business of Nassanwood.
Tell me where to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: If you do not reveal your wishes well enough time, you will not be able to prepare your family for your ministry.
Work on your advice and contact your family to discuss where and how you want to accept it, because it is also important for you to make a decision.
Talk to your financial adviser: Your advice can help you find solutions to these costs.
For long-term ministers, you may want to have a fixed duration of the mission police, if you have the means - you can self-assess a hybrid life-valued police or your own resources to help them.
Resolve your existing documents: Try to stay away from the fight.
Use a proper health care proxy to help your doctor alert a trusted person and to ensure that you do not have contact with the patient so that he or she will comply with your wishes.
And, keep in mind the fact that you're going to get one of your assets.
Select a reliable person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your gift will be returned in the best possible way.
Don't forget about it: Remember that your elderly father needs a doctor who is taking him to the hospital.
Do you know about her allergy and the current medicine?
Keep all these items inside the project so that you can keep them ready.

Make all the plans."

In a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not talk directly about the matter, instead he said that what is going on in the movie is the public's "fashioned and cruel and false" attitude.
"This is something that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the movie a few weeks ago, you'll see Rag when you see naked and sick and lying people," he says.
"When they see the data is empty, "Oh, I didn't.
Oh, I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dean Finstein, what the hell are you doing?
Remember his answer... did you fake the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lie."
Hey, wait a minute.
We've failed... No, we haven't," he says, copying the Senator.
In July, the letter was sent to Ford Finnstein with a description of the charges against Kavanf, and the letter was released in September - but Finnstein refused to leave his office.
"I don't care about Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't do anything," says the Finistin committee, a report by The Hill.
"He told me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret according to his word."
But he didn't want to talk to the president, he opened his eyes at the end of the Saturday night: "What I say is that it was a very bad language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but I've never seen anything worse than that."
Three women who have been accused of sexual misconduct speak to the president of the Supreme Court of Nomine, who says that the Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
"They want power back at any price.
Look at the lowness of mind, look at cruelty, don't have to hurt someone, don't have to change someone's ability and control," said the president, "and the media know.

A hundred lives on the ground in exchange for their lives assured Air Traffic Controller
One of Indonesia's air traffic controllers has been killed after their hundreds of flights to help fly the plane.
More than 800 people were killed on the island of Sulawesi, created by a large earthquake, and many people are missing.
The next company, Joralo, is on its way up to the village bar, and the people are trapped in the desert.
But despite all the deaths of all the workers, 21-year-old Anthonias Gunawan Palulians did not abandon control Tawa, which was at the risk of being hit by Cis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He left and assured that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then in Ranawwee, would be safe to fly.
Then he pushes down the control tower for fear of falling down.
Then he died in the hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation front, Johannes Sirit says, may have saved a number of people's lives, reports the Australian ABS News.
We arrange a helicopter from Balikpan in Kalinanta to take him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter arrived tomorrow morning.
"Our hearts have been disturbed by this news," he added.
In the past, the government's fear that thousands of deaths could be prevented, Mokabila Agents reported that the traffic in the town of Dongala, Sigi and Butong has been limited.
"It is thought that the number of deaths is increasing, because many bodies are still under attack, which have not yet reached," says the Agency's newspaper São Paulo Nugroho.

It's already sad, but things can get worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widododo, went to the palace and told members of the country: "I ask you to stay at your rescue work day and night.
Are you ready?" Report from the CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia's long-term earthquake struck more than 550 years ago.
Micronesia's Flights: The Air New Guinea reported that an Aeronautics on the Legon Airport
When a plane crashed into the Pacific Lake of Micronesia, they had previously announced that 47 passengers and workers had been rescued from Dobwana Airport, and now they know that there is an accident.
In a report from the Air New Guinea hearings, a man cannot find a traveler.
The airline has announced that they are working with local administrations, hospitals and contractors to find him.
The airline has suddenly refused to report detailed information such as age and nationality.
The flight helps to rescue local passengers and workers when they try to name the airport.
The workers announced on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline has announced that five passengers are in the hospital on Saturday, and they are all in a position of stability.
The reason for the accident has not yet been clear about it.
Airline and U.S. Navy both say the plane takes water before arriving in Ranaway.
A number of observers thought the plane had landed in Ranawo.
American traveler Bill Jensens says the plane went down very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jans.
Jans says he and others are getting water from the Comum and arriving at the airport in the evening.
He said the airmen were shooting at the gun and had a light shot on his head.
The U.S. Navy knows that it is near to helping rescue the Nabiks who are in charge of the Syrian occupation, who fly 30 feet (100 feet) to the water before they go through the air, bringing people to the shore.
According to the Agency's network report, the last two decades have killed 111 people on the Aarline, which has been reported to be an Air Nugini.
Researchers have been able to spend time with a living woman
In 2014, a woman was sentenced to life imprisonment in Mississippi and was sentenced to a retrial hearing.
U.S. judicial researcher Paul Raolet Goonda has been a few hours of evidence as an expert in the investigation.
He describes how he built 29-year-old Asami Quentan Telis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers made his death story on the night of his death.
Rawlet says he's retrieving a lot of cell phone information that shows that the dead were together on the night of death with Telis and Chambers, which was reported against the front door of the television, by the Clear Laker.
It is reported that at the time, he was with his cell phone Chambers, even though he insisted that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town at night.
When the guards asked if Telis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied, "The lie is because his truck was in Nashville that day."
Another misunderstanding is that Telis said he knew him two weeks before Chambers died.
From the cellphone record, they've only known each other for a week.
Rawlet says that some time after Chambers' death, Telis will delete text, call and contact information from his phone.
"He's taking her away from life," Haley says.

In the United States, such students as The Fijis and Komun have seen a resurrection in recent years, such as students from the East and People.
The other one?!
New York and I have accused a couple of working after the "Brussels" text.
When a mother receives a text from an interpreter from a mother, a Nani from New York for the mid-year-old student is protesting against a married couple who called him "Arikan Führing".
The wife refused to be a referee and wanted to accuse "jujulum".
Two children's mother, Linci Plasco-Falxman, expresses her frustration after the first day of work in 2016, knowing that Gigel Maris is a new parent of the child.
Ms. Plasco-Falxman wrote her husband as text message.
Come on, she's sending it to Mrs. Marissa twice instead of sending it to her husband.
Later, when he realized his mistake, he wrote to Mrs. Plasco-Falxman Maris, saying that their former African-American Nani, who had been working badly, hoped a Philippines, a New York Post report.
Mrs. Marissa was given a day's notice and then sent back to her house.
Maris is now planning to get a divorce against a couple of couples and wants to lose as a monthly $350 for six months, even though she was first sold as a nanny.
"I want to show them, look, I can't do this," he says to Post once and again, adding, "I know it's possible."
The couple objected to their author's claim that Maris was a legitimate act that would not be trusted after he was accused of being an untrustworthy person.
"He didn't want to say what my wife sent him.
He's not a linguist.
We're not a bisexual couple," says husband Joel Plasco Post.
"But will you abandon your children to someone with whom you have abused, even if they have erred?
Your social child?
Say it."
Plasco said about the "julum" charge that his wife had just given birth to a child before and was in the "very difficult situation".
"Would you like to fight someone like that?
It's not a good thing to do it," says that program banker.
In order to keep an eye on Aini Mambala, the social media in the public court strongly condemned the behaviour of this couple and the fight against equality.
Padington's publisher voiced the fear that readers might not be able to communicate with the good people, published in the new letter
Band's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was born, says about the letter: "It's hard to say before the sky what his thoughts will be for the first time.
After the great success of Padington, it's very funny to know.
His father, who worked as a Bibsy's cameraman before he received a book from a small game well, said that he was desperate to reject his work, and he also said that the 60th anniversary of the release of the book was "Amalmud” to him last year.
Regarding Padington, whom he described as "the most important member of our family," he said that his father was very proud of his immediate success.
"He was a quiet person, and he wasn't a bad person," he said.
"But Padington was so real to him that your child had made a fortune: you're proud of him, even if you don't have a place.
I think that's how he saw Pandington's success.
Although it is a fruit of his creation and imagination, he has always been grateful to Padington.
My daughter was on the way to death and I had to call.
Shortly after his release, his daughter was taken to a hospital in Los Angeles, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called regularly and said it was very bad, and he wouldn't survive," said Mrs. Adnan-Laparoz.
"And then I got Ned's phone and I know he's gonna die in two minutes, and I had to tell him on the phone.
And I do.
I say, "Tashi, Darling, I love you very much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The doctors stopped working in his body long enough to keep his heart involved and went out of his body.
He died a few minutes ago and then everything stopped.
There was no way to wait for me, you know.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was changed to the family and the people.
I'd have to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laparoz, who was in shock at the death of his daughter, ran away on the side of the other travelers - he was indifferent to this difficult situation.
No one knows," he says.
"I had to lift my head, and my eyes were filled with tears.
It's impossible to describe it, but I was the victim of the infamous device of the plane.
Who needs my love and compassion.
I know how good he was.
She puts a card to stop breathing
Two women, who lost their loved ones in death, work to stop the souls of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put a card with a text message in the Welsh Bridge and keeps a phone number where people can call for help.
Miss Davis' son died from depression when he was 13 years old and was 18 years old.
"I don't want any of my parents to feel what I represent," he says.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydia, says that his son was a trusted boss and a respected leader.
"Everyone knew him for his hair.
They all said, "The house is bright in its place."
Anyway, he quit his job before he died, 'cause he's really gone dark.'
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 years old, found him dead.
Mr. Davis said, "I am afraid that this effort will fail."
Mr. Davis made a card, "Tell everyone that there's a person you can talk to, he can be a friend.
You need to sit down and say no.
Miž Hamfres, who has been a partner for many years, lost his 15-year-old companion Mark after his mother died.
"He never said that his mind was bad or he was drunk or anything else," he said.
"Two days before Christmas, I've made some changes.
"Christmas' day was a very bad situation - the children didn't see them when they opened their gifts."
He said that his death had been a great emotional blow to them, but it had to be cut off: "This family had created a great place.
We've been robbed.
But we have to walk and fight."

In front of the future question of the Bret Kavanf when the F.B.I. began
"I thought if we could give him what he wanted - since the time is limited, the opportunity is limited - we could probably bring something else," said Mr. Flyber, adding that he's afraid, the committee might "read in vain" in the face of this crazy act.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanf and his Republican supporters ask F.B. now?
Their duty is related to time.
On 6 November, only five weeks left in the middle of the election - if, hopefully, the Republicans do evil, their lives will become very weak to get the most people in the country's courts.
George Dublow calls the Bush senators and appeals to them to support Mr. Kavanf, who worked under the White House under Mr. Bush, through which he has met his wife Ashkel, who was a personal friend of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FB reported?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanf can get at least 50 votes, so that he can be confirmed in the Supreme Court by the Vice-President Mike Pans.
The number of North Korean troops is "smoothed" under Kim.
Seven years ago, after Kim Jong-un arrived in power, the number of North Korean troops decreased, as a law author of South Korea said.
Park Being-Seg, referring to the Ministry's integration data in South Korea, says the last year's number was 1,127 - which was 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says that the main reason for harsh control between North Korea and China is for human judges to pay money.
There is no comment on Pyjing.
The number of ethnic groups from North Korea who come from South Korea has been given citizenship to South Korea.
Saul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally restricted since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them have fled China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier than being able to be the most protected undefended zone (DMJ) in two Korea.
China, not as a citizen of these goods, but as an illegal citizen and often forced them to return to their country.
The relations between North and South Korea - which are still in the war - have been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the last month, the leaders of the two countries gathered to discuss in Beijing, where there was an ongoing discussion of the structure of the Thames.
It was followed by a historic meeting between President Donald Tramp and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they were automatically agreed to work for the creation of a free Korean weapon.
But in November, North Korea's Prime Minister Reyang-ho condemned the US ban on progress.
In a common language, Mr. Rey says in a language that has been used by the U.S., "If there is no room in the United States, there will be no room for our national security, and in this case we will not set ourselves up for the first time."
Nancy Pelocy Bret Kavanf calls "histeria-grest" and says he is not responsible for the Supreme Court.
The head of the House, Nancy Pellosi Supreme Court, has named Kavanov "histeria-grest" and says he is naturally qualified for the role of the Supreme Court.
Palosi heard about this at a meeting in Texa Tribion Festival, Texas.
In front of the Committee on Judiciary's Senate, Pélosi said about his response to Kavanf's testimony, "I can't believe that if a woman had ever worked like this, she would have been called "histeria-grest".
Kavanf Zor admitted that he had sex with Dr. Christine Blazi when they were both Kisher.
During his first description, Kavanf was excited, his family and he went up to the school to talk about life and went to Shavas.
He specifically condemned Democrats in the Committee and accused Liberians of using a term "extraordinary and Compulsory Charter" that Hilary Clinton's presidential election in 2016 is taking place from the crisis.
Pelocy says he believes Kavanf's testimony proves he's not worthy of the Supreme Court, as it proves he's a coward against Democrats.
"I think that the information he gave and how he prevented Clinton and Democrats has proved himself incapable," he said.
When he was asked if he would honor Kavanf if he was sure and if the Democrats were able to get him into the house, Pelosi continues to explain.
"I'm saying it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or F.I., then he's not only the Supreme Court, but he's not the court, he's not."
Kavanf is currently the judge of the DC's Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelocy adds that as a Democrat, he is concerned that Kavanf Afordable Kaar Act or Ro V. Weed will oppose him because he is a Conservative Justice.
In hearing of his conviction, Kavanf asked whether he would change some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not possible that Histeria-grist, a blind person, would go to court and say, 'That's not right,' says Pelosi.
And women should control it.
It is a fair debate, month and year after year, and it cannot be held.
"Let's get out of here," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's slow, what do you say?"
He also said, "A woman from the neighborhood has helped me a lot, who said that she cried too, but she chose the point that when she started crying, the person who spoke to her said, "You may have felt sorry for me because I was crying.
I'm really tired."
Then he went on.
I thought it was amazing."
In part, they act as a public expression of anger, because they have a fundamental right to misunderstand.
One of the first things I've ever seen in a job, a man-in-the-art office, where I once saw myself sneezing in an incredible rage, was a woman holding my scarf - which was a wrong manager I always feared - who took me to the throne.
"Never let them see you cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're crazy.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, then Colorado Democratic Congressman, worked with him during the presidential election of Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart went to a foreign ship named Munky Bisanez and left for work, there was no reason for him to ask his president.
"It wasn't a very interesting decision," he said to rest at home 30 years later.
"There are already seven other prayers fighting, and no one else wants them.
One said, "Snowait and seven left."
As the preaching was slowing down, he had been behind the mob and therefore insisted that he wouldn't pay $2 million in this car.
It was a war of war.
He saw that if a supportive man was given $1,000, he would only be given $250.
"What do they think I'll get worth?" he said.
When he announced that he would not engage in an organizational campaign, he became very proud of his supporters and his money-generating system, which made it difficult for him to turn the voters away from the representatives, and he became angry about the possibility of marriage.
"You may think that my dream has come true," Mr. Schroeder recalls the news media's reaction.
"You might think, Clinex, my corporate sponsor.
I thought, I thought, where would they give me a hug?
"He's crying?"
How the US-China war can lead to Beijing
The first mountain of the U.S.-China war was full of chaos, and when the war broke out, the bi-country bilingual conflict can be long-lasting, like experts.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, warned first about the launch of the Solar Panel, the Espaat and the Aluminum major China Ruftani plans to start this year.
The most notable answer is this week, when China's total imports from China are about half a billion dollars (150 billion pounds) of new shells.
They've made a promise like Beijing every time - they've recently increased from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars in US dollars' worth of money.
China has decided to fight with its eyes, and the world's second largest economy cannot be seen soon.
Washington's claim to follow up, but apparently the Chinese president Shi Jinping will be very disappointed.
However, experts say that if Beijing is able to play cards properly, the US pressure on economic warfare can help China in less than a long time.
"As a result of a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing, the economic situation in both countries can be created more dangerous than that of Wakybhal Mahle," says a researcher named Abigail Grace of the Center for New American Security, who calls for Asia.
Syria said 'Prepared' to return his goods to the state minister.
Syria says the country is ready to return to the refugee camp, and for seven years they have called for the warhead country to return.
While speaking in general terms, Prime Minister Walid Al-Mowalem says the country is making progress.
"The progress in combating terrorism is stable and secure today," he says.
The government has been unable to restore normal conditions in areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
The situation is now similar to that of people who are forced to leave the country because of the economic situation of terrorism and the perpetuity of life and food.
According to the national estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people from the country need human help.
Al-Mowalem says the Syrian government welcomes all assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he also strongly said that no counterattack will be accepted or the aid will be received by the beneficiary country.

In the United States, Phil Michaelson, who was unable to play well at the most of the tournaments, may have died at -3 16 o'clock in the morning, and died at his grave in Francesco Molinary.

The experience of Atbar Rider Cap, Sergio Garsia, Spain, has become Europe's greatest winner at 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I haven't left now.
It's been a very bad year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so glad to have you back.
It's the team's success, I'm glad I'm able to help," European Je Abegaplutt says Garcia.
He owes his country's hands, which has lost the American Ligend Gluffer Tiger Woods in the Rubbar Syngloms in two and a half years.
"I'm too proud to lose Tiger Woods, and I see her grow up," says 23-year-old Ham.
Woods France lost his four masks, and his records were on the radar.
This is Bemanan statistics for the best of all players, which has won 14 main games since Jack Niclas was only in his head.
The top-valued Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, the top-ranking performance show, has been on top of the team US for a week.
U.S. President Jim Furic said after his group's terrible confrontation, "I'm proud of them, they've fought.
Today, we have something on Europe.
We couldn't.
Congratulations on Thomas.
He's a good leader.
All of his 12 players played very well.
"We'll stand back, I'll work with the U.S. P.J. and the radar team and go ahead.
I'm proud to be the leader of these 12 people.
You'll have to tell them.
We didn't get up in the game."
Red Srout: Pinellas, Manats and Sarasots reduce tension
In the first new report of the Florida Fish and Wildleiff Commission, the red rose has been seen in the Tumpa Pressagar region.
According to FD, Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Colliery have seen the state of the pacific flower - which is a symbol of the decline.
The red rose's blue blue penellas ranged from about 130 miles south of Li County to the south.
Hillsboro County can be seen about 10 miles away, but it has been less noticeable in the past week than in the past week.
