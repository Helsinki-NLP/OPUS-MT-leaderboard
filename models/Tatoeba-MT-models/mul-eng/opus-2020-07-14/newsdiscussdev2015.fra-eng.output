I think it's gonna be a typical ruby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to see with the rugby clubs I knew in NZ.
But it doesn't make any sense, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's running in the rugby is the big thing...
Yes, we do not interrupt the prayers of the Muslims and we do not break a person’s nose during the drinking games (end, unless it is part of the game), but we are actually pinned into black for some evenings spent.
I've never played a drink game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeah and Ride the Bus enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospects of first-year students seemed quite typical.
That said, this new information left no doubt in my eyes that they will be far more far away than the mystical posters and blogs under the alcohol business that are often associated with university ruby teams.
The incident with the Muslim students shows particularly well that they were trying to cause the maximum.
You certainly don't know anything about the rugby clubs.
But then why let your injuries and stereotypes prevent the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is popular with former students of these schools for which the competition rugby is a tradition.
In other words, old guys from the private.
There are very different environments from those who play in rugby in NZ, of very different attitudes.
So are the "myokinic posters" acceptable?
I've never seen racist behavior at my university's rugby club, but the naked courses through the fields, the flight, the destruction of goods and the mission were all part of the game.
Not at all.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in my last comment.
You can see it differently: say that your own body itself is part of this ancient water.
I'm going to win seriously.
Thus, antistral also this interstellar cloud (of, not traditional:)
@lux You have not read the article: a small half of the water of your pastis has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yes, well we can take it very seriously when we consider that the fleet of pastis has an average of more than 2.3 billion years, which is not as bad as it is.
A sacred foot of snow to the catastrophic and rainflakes of all fields that predict the end of oceans and water resources, while this water still exists.
An irrefutable proof that the recovery ended 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@Manon tooo: What evidence is there that the rechasing has stopped?
I don't see the connection.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second grade and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological problems.
It is not a question for the "catastrophists" as you say to worry about the destruction of oceans but rather the reduction of water reserves by humans (you know the sweet water that represents less than 1% of total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, this is not the most threatening climate recovery for our species, but especially the reduction of low or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that sustain our lifestyles more and more gourmands.
As for the study that you are reading and that you are making the best effort to quote the source, there is little doubt about the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to the problems of soft water, I assure you that the French are far from being concerned about xD Then you have to stop considering the ecology as a non-failure dogm, the ozone layer is being slowly referred to (estimating 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
The ecology, yes, the religious doctrine and irrigated ecology, don't thank you.
"Then you have to stop considering the ecology as a dog without fail, the hole of the ozone layer is about to return quietly" Yes, it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate recovery is a necessity because if we send too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A lock that will catch the heat without releasing the oxygen by the action of the oxygen and that will accelerate the closing process exponentially in a nearby circle.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the smallest sign indicating that 10,000 good men would come on the ground to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
Of course not!
In the small brain of Abbott, it may be that sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We're moving forward to rounds, that's certain.
When are they gonna get out of this village idiot?
The latest findings show that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 more than any climate model allows priority for replanting.
It is not logical, since CO2 is the food of plants that is the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flower in the world.
It should be said that this scientific fact has never been published.
Have you seen the army see some part?
Don't do anything, dear government.
The CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument about the food of plants is only a failure.
And before you start your fire against the Wall Dooms, the most abundant english is not CO2 but nitrogen and sophre.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials may be carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant English, so Silverhead's argument is false and worthy of being reticulated.
Direct Action is a trap, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Red Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was the most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most advertising to re-mount the liberals to marginal voters.
Your contribution, in return, merit the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants produce less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and humans need to eat more and more to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this is a fair member is evidence.
To date, he has not submitted academic rigidity certificate which prevents him from breaking the rules of XVIIe.
To this end, the penalty for him and not Thévenoud is inconceivable for not the evil of the world, even though the UN regulation is not a tax treaty.
That this lady's doing a whole thing isn't to her honor, it's mostly like history.
If Mitterrand had put all those who claimed Mitran...
I remember that in the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academies" was upset: "Let's say to my guardian or guardian of the Sceaux" (post that until then had never been occupied by a woman).
For magic!
"The political arrene" ...!
The sandy bath, the back-right of the Republic reflects, the marigot of operas, the table of illusions, etc ...
But the air is assumed by gladiators, people who take real risks, good grain, bad grain.
Qd the phallocrate is based on the label and Parliamentary regulation by violating the civility + elemental paraplete under the false paraplete of good ways, the sentence applies to him "quality" for his partial understanding and his misunderstandings of the political arena.
The behaviour of this member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making the provocation to talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, he can now be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The two-level academics and we see that the members are sensitive to the pockets...
The UMP will have to try to solve its internal problems and stop causing cocaine and scandals.
Academie's got two, especially when we tell him what she doesn't say.
This delegation is acting as a college in full-time youth crisis, which is provocating and whose partners, in delegation, want to see the Principal to cancel college hours.
and defend it on the basis of a text that they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15 per cent of the members of the UMP.
Mr. Judge, I call on two expert witnesses that a few thousand years apart.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
The dogs, the dolphins, the otters, the horses, they do everything stupid for the simple pleasure that they're looking for.
On the contrary, it would seem that the majority of us are working, moving, and making magazines.
The strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by our two lifetimes, but we pass the majority in the nest.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion that it's anthropomorphism.
The game is a meta-communication.
Watch out.
It's always an illusion.
In addition, the "communication" means necessarily a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's true.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate with the dog that I would like to play – body language.
After that, there is a variation indicating whether the game will be a race, an object to go looking for, etc.
This is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that we hear a lot of stories about animals that are being "played" while they are simply communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useable" (it may be, or not), is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of game based on any physical reality."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have violated it" Perhaps, the hope made him live...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, be healthy and have the power to answer an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to respond to it at the age of 15 years.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite excited by those who appear first.
But when we see what many have kept their education at school, especially among the most likely public to commit aggression against women, my enthusiasm is not the least in the beginning of an accompaniment.
"the most likely public to surrender to attacks on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's good, we understand.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel the rose, even though it doesn't strongly correspond to your thinking patterns.
It is true that the dear young Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen very much to class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
Evry's wasted youth too!
If the reactions did not respond anymore, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I learned nothing of this at school and I never raped anyone (and that's not in my mind).
Should I like chance?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values...
The family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How to start reading life when we can't read?
And what about young socialists going to dance schools to teach gender equality?
This would be more effective than doing moralistic mountings on Twitter, but it would have to go out of beautiful neighborhoods...
That's a big campaign.
They're nothing else but to give moral lessons, it remains the best.
It's all photogenic, but I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a blog about using his bread.
This week's article isn't going to work.
It's not the time to make jokes about the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have played a double word game with the word "nam" to refer to a great mother.
60 books for that?
This would not even fill the stomach of an old 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How does it make more money, less there's in the asset?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure weight or number of calories, nor is it the quality of a film or piece not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a minor?
This doesn't make any sense, and that's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more plates.
Of course, he should not be like that.
The Sportsman in Seaalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini plates.
The more you pay for it, the more you have the chance to get a child's lot with art in your seat.
At least they've done their best to put up with it.
So when I want to go to a restaurant in South York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good places?
It is that the Manif for all is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, it is a kind of homophobic collection.
But it's not just there.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern child manufacturing systems.
A child must not be raised in a battery high or manufactured by a technology device.
- High battery?
You've got to get out of here.
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "production", you must claim the prohibition of PMA for heterosexual couples, that would be the merit of coherence.
I am also surprised that the manuf "for all" has not yet had this logical claim to its catalytic attraction.
it is true that this is not the only cathodes that show: other religions as well, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is also helpful to remember that these different churches have been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a widow, Mr. Dupanloup was violently opposed to the willingness of the gvt to admit girls to school in the name of "the family's defense".
We're still in the same scheme.
And, more recently, the same currents have rushed to the collapse of civilization and to the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
The credit is that we can give it to these people's positions.
You don't need to be catho to avoid the marketing of the windows and children...
All of this is in the right line of the decline of Western civilization, further challenged by others!
For me, freedom ceases to one another: yes, to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love themselves and others.
But it's not about tolerance that the child is a beautiful object.
And this is also valid for heteroes in GPA query.
I can't just love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had a better control of the balloon and knew how to avoid falling moments of stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, besides Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will make a significant number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have noted if more than 42 selections had been given to him in a national team...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Because this article is talking about the goals he has marked, I am not going to talk about other things he brings, especially in ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa does not bring or does nothing), but perhaps this would be another reason why he has been much more often chosen than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 07 2014 12h48 Recommendation 119 It's the way to criticise Rooney at this moment so we can forgive you for doing so too.
It is good to note that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Auguero has marked 56 goals and has made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take them to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
In addition, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to recycle it.
I'm obliged to ask if you really look at the foot or if you think Peter Crouch A would merit so much choices as Rooney and B) would mark so many goals if he had so many choices.
I really don't understand where the criticisms about Rooney's capabilities are coming from as a football player.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing the quality of football (not even attacking) Wayne Rooney with those of Peter Crouch?
You're doing this without bluffing?
There really are people in the mass.
Please note also for your government that Rooney has not always been the front car center for England during his career in England's team.
Instead, he played before he was removed, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch, mentioned above, German Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You've written this out loud.
In a country where the arms gate is tolerated and in a state where 71% of the people have a weapon, I find it completely schizophrene and paradoxal as a way of proceeding.
And even those of this school are not quite agreeing with the U.S. arms-port authority!
Crayon is always a killer.
Stop at the connery: the 5-year-old girl.
How many gammas do they play with handguns at this age in our home?
Is that what the killers are doing so powerfully?
Although the port of arms is in the American constitution and it strongly influences the culture of the country, I do not think that the rich sizes are significantly different from ours.
A little good sense and reason kept svp.
It's a disarming process!
Make sure you're sure!
The information on this variety is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not have any premiums for the taste of the infant.
Would we be surprised by the principle that a serial killer can no longer have a strange behavior at the age of 5?
If people need a psy follow, it's more mabuls in this school than students!
Let the parents get their taste out of there: she's in danger!
All right.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant one.
Alabama is not the most representative state of the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
What about young people?
These gruesome blue costumes that men wear have nothing to do with a entrepreneur!
What was Alan Sugar or Richard Branson at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar carried a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson brought a roll-over powder.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but everything's going to stop if I'm tired and without a soul.
I don't have the impression that that's what he meant.
On the contrary, maybe?
But that's what it's like to be depressed!
You made me.
I'd have thought a great knowledge of English would be an excuse for business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou's doing these days.
Maybe by saying "ostracisser," he meant "aliener".
That would be logical.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracism doesn't always make sense.
On the other hand, if all candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar was wearing a gray suit, it could be said that their intention was to distract him.
But here, no.
It would have been said that it was corrected – strange. Perhaps the whole sentence was invented!
It's not weird.
Well, who knows what he's got to say?
Of course nothing, but someone just wanted to quote something...
Thus, the word used in the article was well "obstructive", which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States was still low at about 6 per cent.
I've never seen you since 2001.
The prices of essence fall in all states.
The American economy, along with Obama, is constantly being strengthened.
Who says better?
You have a very short look...
Their economy becomes "sustainable"?
To live there at this time, I will say that the United States is nearing the explosion as inequalities become public.
The political system is literally capable of financing electoral campaigns.
The racial tensions, police violence, mass imprisonment have an extent that we don't imagine in Europe, but Americans have an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
This is the main issue.
A few days ago, the English financial environment said that France was lost.
Now, it's America that's at the end of her roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UN to save the world.
Another of these articles that simply forget the essential.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
These and a board of tickets would not have been able to change for a long time...
Based on the expansion of earth's resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And the weakest and the poor, a very large majority of citizens, will "drink" or rather die.
I can't read this Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy to import compatible foreign voters has made him even more supportive of him?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their ongoing cold war with Russia.
The shameful performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the age of 617 votes.
About Clacton 11% for the Work – funny, really exciting.
The whole world is more or less at the time that the government's massive immigration policy was designed to "take the nose of the right to diversity"
The Labour wins the partial election, the Tours lose the partial election in security against ukip = Crisis Work Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it's the same Multiculturalism that brings this manoeuvre back, the pendulum has spread very far since the end of the war, and I think it will now divide in another sense.
Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol-Secret de Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depression Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in the den knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for the Labor it is a victory at Pyrrhus.
Search for the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argument against the word "dissolved", it will win the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a winner, but she's a witch.
The Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I have little interest in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia.
On the contrary, I wonder if the alliance between Venus and Mars, etc., should not be considered as well?
In general, the Earth has to be seen as more “pity ” or evil than we can imagine.
Is that so?
A few little perpetrates.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us about a "mechanism quite simple: with the disappearance of the ice on the earth's crust, the pressure on the handle slows down, which would give/give a) a break in the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface????
In any case, either the "footcut" or the facilitating access to the site (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inverse As for climate recovery, it seems to me to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
So friendly, patriotism, is this volcanicism not affecting our environment?
Is there any effect on our climate recovery, the future or the past?
Isn't it true that it's no longer boring?
When complexity cannot be resolved by simplification, we apply this simplicity and observe.
Yes, but also, when it's nighttime, we see less.
Good morning, the end of the last ice period was also accompanied by a stronger sysmic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain ranges on the highly engulfed continents of Canada, Scandinavia).
CB Cordial
It is too often ignored that the earth’s crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it up or down from a few 30 to 60 cm, in contrast, following its passage to the Zenith, as it does for ocean waters.
The result is that the melting of the technical plates, as well as the marinas, is more or less facilitated by this moving box, as much as the polar shells are relieved by the source of the ice, thus causing a change in the earth's balance to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am afraid of this "human", saying the superman of Nature and his self-proclaimed commander, to reciprocate by his stupid action on the environment that created him and which he was so separate who became harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all of this to remain the supreme commander of this nature who exceeds him in the organization of his own views, by an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, the others, moving from collaboration, money.
The earth’s crust does not rest on the magma, but on the ground floor, which is made of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at it.
Ready and proud.
That reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful Wild1 story
This reminds me of a totally brilliant series of 2002 around which was called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost nobody remembers them right now.
The damage you've never done in addition to the first impression.
Your loss...
“The ice, our distant ancestors” You should review this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you, Brian.
I'm almost certain that the "Human History" documentary has already been carried out several times, they're still going to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian's "air miles" Cox, who's going to Ethiopia to pretend to be looking at a brain in a bottle.
And that narrative...
It must be hard for you, obliged to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a group of support for you, that's what I'm saying.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Marcel Gauchet is a Marxist bus?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that is foreseen today.
So she needs to be herself, of course, so not.
True, but Descartes is also present at the time of the arrival of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this excitement.
But at that time these are just the premises that appear, today individualism forms the whole society, whether educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're good in the individualism of "mass!"!
Without making an inexhaustible horizon, there is no parentage with the Cartesian approach to examining what we believe, what we believe ourselves.
More than rebellion, doubt is fictitious.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
By putting the problem at the level of its paranoid numeral, it blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of the follicle.
And it led to the most repressive and reactive vision that follows: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and being anti-conformist, it is to fight this wildfire.
We call Marcel Gauchet to be an order defender.
Excellent idea!
You're beautiful and rebellious, you're asking some...
Blacks and rebel, to others.
Beautiful and robotic, including the most followers of those who see themselves rebellious in their vision.
Thank you in any case for his controversial polymers to be released under the fires of Marcel Gauchet, this patient and enduring humanist, and if it is pedagogically clear.
David Cameron supports the increase in the tax threshold on inheritance
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay for the social benefits of this rich person?
If the robot is going to increase its net value once it's no longer in power.
Business councils, accommodations, consultation fees, a series of best sellers written by a blackman on "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once he has passed the left arm.
Of course, he does not want tax on inheritance.
Isn't that the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay very little tax on inheritance due to super well-paid accounts and tax relief programs.
This has all the signs of an Empire in which the heritage kills innovation.
He'll be 100 £ once he'll have left the gun.
Nothing.
He'll probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well beyond what you say is worth.
What was your position when the Labor doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you think Brown thought he was his own heir, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We haven't picked it the last time, we've had a coalition at the place.
You could not allow him to be accused of lying unless he was actually elected by power.
Like the rest of us, Dave will not die "normally".
Climate change and global warming will end, he and others will end.
His “richness ” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
A non-compulsory income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeds £1,000,000.
We must all be obliged to pay the essential services and pay the debt.
I agree with you, Exidonys.
I'm not saying that discipline's educational is useless, of course, I'm just saying it's not enough to compensate for some natural "inadequacies".
A little reasonable statement for the professor of mathematics she was!
Like what...
Better recruiting and training teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class does not know of any other quantitative approach.
There are 2 possible answers, 1 would be to select teachers according to their ability to convey knowledge => reform of recruitment methods.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Without understanding them, she doesn't know how to act or react to work well => It's reduced to create a challenge relationship that affects everyone in the world in good health => there's a need for training skills to teach.
A meteor that learns, of course.
But pedagogy is primarily an art, a natural provision and a profession before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not a manufacturing of car parts.
The pedagogy is not even equivalent when we're professor of mathematics!
Education sciences cannot compensate for a lack of natural abilities.
What is lacking right now is a true vocation in the bcp of those who embroiled the prophet.
If there are gifts, pedagogy (I prefer disciplineal education) allows those who are less willing to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective question.
The real unknown today are the students who tell us 1/3: learning doesn't mean anything I already know what I think.
Slate's article well describes the Chaotic situation of this return.
Let's fix the old Normal Schools of Institutors..
It ends at 3 p.m. this week, but it starts at midnight.
If this is found, it is appropriate in any way to its use of time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
I don't think that's right.
It's been years since it started at midnight.
We have this trick called iplayer that allows us to listen to the application when we want it!
The Internet, it's rather incredible, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio broadcasts anymore.
I have a type of usb adapter at two of my SKY box and who's connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV has made it very complicated.
Well, I think I'm being deceived in the hours, and I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 hours.
Although these men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in their front hour when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least that would please people.
They should start getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its issue is of any sensitive matter that has been discussed, and it would be better on a chain like the LBC.
The lack of women DJs in the day, where not one of the regular cheerleaders, Chris Evans' morning at Simon May's release on the night of his return to work, is not a woman
It's five emissions.
So which (of these five) is the most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows it very well, but don't say anything - for the moment.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detailed of these times.
Jeremy Vine may have been transferred to the offices as a real journalist, but the dinner keeps the whole daily mail from a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's calm, waiting for the current team to take him or make him turn around.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For 40 years, we have the same two parties who have been in power and who have given the keys of the country to the others in the least good condition that they have not taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, much poorer than the banies with increasing isolation.
It takes km to find a movie, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But as they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't act, they don't care about political men...
But thanks don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, these are men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have a very high rate of abstinence and early alcoholism as well...
The UN advocates human beta, incult and ignorance so much that it still has a huge potential for growth, it really needs to be bad for them not to do better...
Today, the UN is primarily concerned with poverty, the fear of the day, the fear of the other and the feeling that there is no vision.
But yes, you're right!
What amazing humanity.
Happily, there is a bunch of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and wise to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the voters for c...
Here's what's going on.
Who's "they"?
In fact, there is less than one resource in less than one resource.
Here's the comment I left on Twitter (@priya963) Listen you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I am saying here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being set out, such as childcare and socio-productive roles.
This allows women to recognize that they can work in the economic sphere and that is super - it is necessary.
But this is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double flow, that is, we will expect them to move on to their work as they continue to play their socio-professional role.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
The economy and benefits do not recognize the role of sex.
The money speaks, and if a sex isn't at the height, then!
The benefits come from the life you lead.
What are you doing, what is the advantage, and what do you have to offer?
Benefits are derived from the heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, the companies would listen.
Employees will never employ women between 20 and 45 years of age.
Say good-bye to my sister.
It is very problematic that no one is talking about social work that is not paid in this article.
In some countries, the value of unremunerated social work (with the majority of women) should be equivalent to over 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention that men do not do it enough), but it allows us to operate our societies and preserve our work.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to McKayadee, how can we take into account the responsibilities that women have assumed in a way that is disproportionate to women when they are engaged in gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot of people who need to burn a house.
The tiger is not Russian. It's only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are only responsible for the current situation and would be better advised at the negotiating table.
The right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, long-term exercise before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no antiquated missiles in its possession.
You're going to free Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yes, you do.
He just came to me the same kind of idea.
Here's a premise that's been found to shoot some separatists to join China.
If Siberia's tiger is in China, it's China in Siberia.
It's just time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, magnificent feline and in real danger of extinction finally turn into an article that leads to Putin?
What's he doing?
So this is not a leaflet on the Siberian tiger, but a booklet on the follow-up of a Poutine operation.
When we expose ourselves to the media, we also expose ourselves to the irony of criticism.
The permanent victimization return of the Soviet poutinian sympathy.
Hollande had also taken the powder with her chamé without calling it in the French Anti-Français.
Our teacher Alain Bougrain-Dubourg is a sacred defender of the Great Russia has been personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger's got everything, he's got a bar...
That's what Holland is doing. It's something.
At first glance, it seemed like a horrible coincidence.
However, on the basis of the article, it would be said that it is both a response to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
So it's hard to find something to do.
And if only 53 per cent of this sample had broken teeth before and 73 per cent after, it's a little empty to complain about parentalism.
After all, there's no one who dares to brush his teeth!
In fact, the complaints appear to be related to the fact that they are intended to be addressed to the complainants and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if this seems to be true, then this is not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Development to young people.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I think.
But he had a reasonable thought.
There's an inconsistencies in breaking the teeth.
If you brush them after having a bottle of wine, it can damage the stomach.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can cut the knee and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guinness Book of Records where someone had tried to brush his teeth the longest time and the Guinean judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of a frequent and prolonged toothbrushing.
Firstly, it is very important.
I think it's going to be an experimental design that's broken.
The simple contribution to this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
This is why most behavioral studies include tricks such as double eye, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person experiencing social benefits, there are two things that differ from the test: (1) They are not volunteers, and (2) they do not return information on the times when they are breastfeeding or not breastfeeding (slightly incorrect results in the air by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Is there any side effects at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr. Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including uterine) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited treaties could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterine flu affect this phenomenon?
The trend is similar to a kind of flu.
The consequences are likely, but as long as we don't want to have a perfect clone of ourselves, is there a problem first?
I think it's going beyond the limit of rationality.
The desire for motherhood and patriarchal status should not be forced to go further, without the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and for her baby.
The medicine is not all powerful, it is not unlimited and yes it is sad and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they wish to have.
That's nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the train.
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk and manage your little witnesses to yourself, alone in your little pants to yourself.
from their "conferencing" this magic bag for them to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep you in my safe if he can still give you love?
The current stressful circumstances make the PR FRYDMAN cautious about its communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that this is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
What you're going to put us as an early argument: cf here these reactions all men carefully....
Marjane, no organ gift has anything to do with it.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not entirely anadine.
I was enrolled as a spinal cord provider (I have never been selected because the selection is very strict and it is understood both for the recipient and for the giver), it is a real operation.
Now as a man, I wouldn't be able to judge in a sense or another or take part in this gift, but I'll listen to the women talking.
@Margane: Indeed, it has nothing to do with it, and it strengthens the act of love that it involves.
Giving a queen to a member of her family who needs nothing more than anodin, and that's done!
Please don't combine Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially that there's no more real competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
The Messiah is the best football player.
Deportito has become a yyo club.
They're too good for the Second but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sports before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo continues to do everything to fight all the real Madrid goals this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a calm conscience...
I don't think so.
I think Ronaldo will finish his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the international oil investment company?
I looked at it on a fucking connection, so I can't tell you a lot if it's not because Valencia was well defended and without counting the property, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the ground environment wouldn't go too fast, but they played well.
The game of Parejo in the whole is getting better.
A brutal criminalty allegedly claimed but saved to a fair title by Diego.

A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, “On the Origins of Momification, ” well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archeologia 524 of September last.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and do what becomes intuition.
Not surprisingly, before you get complicated, it's easy.
All science progresses by little.
And the woman's body, which was thus preserved, was ?
Oh, my God!
Good morning and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me that a black girl had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, especially geographical and temporary (I think it was 1,000 years ago in the first known African mummies).
Do you have information about this?
Thank you for your advance.
She sings a little reading.
These may not be pollutions of modern times.
Would the desert at the time not be far away now?
Why not imagine plants such as the cannabis strung to the place where there is only the sand now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough for a European scholar to claim, even without any proof, that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and the Africans today have never invented me.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If this is not and always "from his bad predecessors."
You should read the article.
Here is an article prepared by the neoliberal chains of the free market that deals with the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people approaching Ebola and on whom the Spanish government thinks of us, so as not to give us a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but governments in particular (e.g. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, do not hesitate to call your local MP and complain of lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a band of connards, good to nothing and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt this is their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all due respect and compassion for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that enable millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say, yes, it is important.
If they had to repatriate the missionaries completely, I don't see why they couldn't send them to an air force base and take them there in a field hospital instead of in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had a mission to deport the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalised hospitals in Madrid, which is its basis for power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-wing journalist in public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's wrong with the next elections.
To be just towards Cameron (I know this is not easy here) he is socially far from his right and would find his place in the religious communities of right in America.
Now he has to sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously come down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party right to Spanish law.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government thinks about almost everything it has to do with it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading informed rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called The comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting the work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, it will not be done.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
A lot of TPE patterns - PME seems to read The World to take time to condemn Mr.
Steps on the early intellectualism of the atmosphere.
A Law teacher in the College of France seems unable to know the labour market unless it is a Nobel prize for the economy and proposes to liberalize it completely.
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villermé observed children's work at 8 a.m. 10 a.m. every day, when the Canuts were taking a view of a signed collective convention.
Oh, good old time...
Your reaction is also fascinating by your knowledge of the TPE pattern meter!
Its aim is not to know the right in all its sizes, but to manage and produce.
Four manually registered amounts on my youth payroll, more than 100 information today!
Here's an example, we could quote a lot more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without any measure of consequences, and which engulfs the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you wrote it as an expert and not as a Sorbonne client.
In order to break the gap on the archipelago argument of the French Labour Code in relation to the winter, a serious university would be extended into Swiss texts and would have compared the number of official texts, then comments (the absence of the latter might mean that the Swiss laws are more understandable than we are).
By comments in a Code, whether of work or not, we refer to the case-law, including...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is charged with applying the laws when a employee is licensed, for example...
Who's this complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisdiction, conventions, contracts) are applicable to the work and trade of non-supportable obstacles?

How hard is that?
Pullmann "The art has practically been immunized against the criticism of Mrs.

There is certainly a time when new revolutionary absurdities are making the criticisms...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I have recently received, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Come on!
You'll see, the choice is not missing in the world of art.
If China is able to produce new artists who are not Communist parties' passports, the world will be interested.
Yes, GenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are the portals of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not the portals are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those among you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you're talking about.
Thanks for that, you're coming to ruin my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but it was worth it to expose it at all costs (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who excavates old ceramics and calls it art, isn't it?
There's art, and then there's vandalism trying to attract attention.
True artists are different.
A beautiful artist.
His father is also a non-bad poet.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is reluctant to take a selective mandate of the extremists on any board (including Zionists) must be set aside.
Philippe Karsenty and his theories of the plot, which have valued him with several judicial sentences, are both ashamed of Israel and the Mary of Neuilly.
He does not represent either one or the other.
Philippe Karsenty fought against the truth alone, marginally.
HOW TO TAKE ASSESSMENT
What's to do the Marie de Neuilly against Philip Karsenty, who attacks a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls to attack this citizen?
Crime Apology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges ?????
This type of care is needed, as is the case with Ulcan Chelli, both in the theory of the antijuif/anti-Israeli conspiracy and whose resources are perfectly identical to those of their most angry tractors.
As many people believe in every political decision the hand of the “synastics” (the end of which is intended to disappear, because of his abuse), both there, as well as the LDJ or even the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an objective antisemitism “that is not without remembering the earliest hours of our history because it is still the spirit of my good lady who was believed to return to Russia in the 19th century.”
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the summit on September 11 are a very serious Beatrice.
And this type has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
In order to clarify my analogy with the theory of the 11 September summit, there is confusion about how to deal with the issue.
It is entirely obvious that a completely farfetched truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to put it in place, is not supported by this theory to detach it (as in the case of extreme religious).
It is a logical and inexhaustible step forward, the end justifies all means, even lies, which is a cable, but the cable does not seem to disturb the mission of the concerned.
You are advised to be careful and not put the whole world in the same panel, but that is what you do for September 11.
There is still a lot of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/consortes do not seem to be forced to answer.
There are actually very colorful theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, no more is no role right now...
Health NGOs and public health portals find that the results of the study are widely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
As smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it caused in our society will be exposed.
More than expect everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to be happy to say tricks like "excessive consumption of alcohol is growing," but what demands (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you think it's an attack - you're going to drink a glass and you're here?
It's better to risk it than to endanger my mental health by leaving me alone.
The government ends the pleasure when it costs him money.
Here are other alarming advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two averages per day are at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should compete (all of one or two wines, but not more than three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to pay them back, like the smokers!
They already do it - soon this will be the tree!
My father didn't smoke or smoke, and the cancer took him to 64 years.
So I'm going to continue drinking my two red bottles on Fridays and Saturday evenings (and the other evenings when my wife isn't there).
Why is the Cancer Council encouraging children to go to places where alcohol is served? It is an old age that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a risk of cancer in our day????
The sharks don't catch the cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Requins can attract cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when we can run and run together.
Complete agreement.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
To both of them, they destroyed the F1 under security.
We hope it's better than Schumi or at least Wendlinger's crash in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but focus on point 1: this is not the F1, but the circumstances of the circuit that have refused to move forward so as not to run TV broadcasts.
In fact, +1
I just want a quick and quick return to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that failed to occur between depletion and f1 were without cost warnings.
We knew that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, said it for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the FIA allow these manoeuvres without getting out of the safe car?
I cannot accept that the risk of meteer or failure of chance cannot be identified when it has not been prevented from predictable.
But this accident was him.
It is true even when it is said that there was a yellow suit, which not only means "restriction to pass through the area" but has the first intention of signaling a danger.
It's not embarrassing, it's happy for the family who should be in front of the TV.
Even under yellow crews, pilots will just lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the vibration can be much more slowing the next turn and the pilot, believing to arrive with enough margin, can even be speeded down at a normal speed.
Well, we're in the empty space there, until we're not seeing the images, we're not going to be able to issue a written notice.
I don't see too much of that change.
Is there any injuries?
According to the CBC, no injury has been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before it happened, which makes me ask what caused the crash.
It's hard to believe there's still balls where we're supposed to be keeping 24 hours.
I don't think there were people injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may have been animals, such as eggs, raccoons, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the strongest population density in North America and Toronto's agglomeration accounts for at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains will not go as far as enchanting and these types of trains often cross popular urban areas.
Nearly every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains fail very, very often in one day.
In addition, as roads often follow water courses in regions where lakes, rivers or oceans exist, they also go through densely populated areas, because people always want to live near water.
Also, the whole railway traffic passes through the center of a city because it was a central element of the original construction of road lines here.
You may have tried to be useful, but there is a potential great deal for railway accidents in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report about this last night, really shocking.
Did you obviously not read the article on the destruction and explosion of a train in a town of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city just before the railway.
That said, when ferret roads were built, they passed through the center of established communities because it was the direct and central road.
It may be that Canadian National Railways Company employees should attend the next Conference on Dangerous Products in Calgary, Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, is about the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers it could not exist for other reasons.
The problem is there, and the executions of the theologians do not only strengthen this fact, but what good is it to discuss the sex of angels?
"God said, it's good - it's bad" > It's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
A word from a leader (Muslim country but not important): "But without religion, how do you want people to have you?"
In other words, listen to the care of a Rabbin priest and pray, that is better!

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, there's Robespiere in some way trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults : the strong euro ( rather at this moment ) or the free market ( probably supported by the State when it needs to reflow ) , etc .
Great ideas from religious developments.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profanity.
Where the rationale emerges, the religion is at the back and expresses itself in the shadow.
Religion is born as an ideological support of the State, and the gods served the ambitions even if they also brought forms of protest.
The theology condemned between loyalty in the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time did not know the question.
Fanaticism is often described as a bad interpretation of "holy texts".
This does not stop the examination of these texts that are filled with explicit prejudices to the hatred of the offender.
Rather, these are the moderate religious (and fortunately the majority) who "read bad" the texts and only consider them to be humanism and common values to all mankind, both atheists and believers.
For me, fanaticism is the evil and evil application of passage of sacred texts from their context.
Thus, some verses of the Koran calling for the killing of the "mercenaries", "infidels", "hypocrits", "jufis" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if it is not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a situation of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit: "on the "foulard", it is a religious requirement that makes the almost unanimity of the "sacrifices" today.
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point of this is that this has led to a general conviction.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same injury as that shown in the clip?
Néandertalian bands superseded and hypersexualized.

What they have brought us out with our neighbors, For life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Junior Einstein, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasmanie and this satanic Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, here's what he gave us!
If you turn your eyes off the TV for a moment, you will see Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples, which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The Australian film produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The outstanding Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Kate Blanchett.
The only thing that hates your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me have another opinion.

The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most brilliant.
Its articles are seriously missing.
It understands whether Putin is founded and those who support it.

Good effort, Savantcosi!
But you may not know yet that Castals is just a small Moscow telegraphist who has only done that in his days.

The almost totality of 331 deaths since the ceasefire is civilians of the Donbas victims of military bombings, from controlled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically proposed responsibilities in the article without osser until clearly designated separatists is in the world's Ottoman line that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities in order to maintain the felicity of the pro-European newborns facing the Russians courageously.

If I fully understand your concern about the wicked are Ukrainians and Russian Stalinists would not be a little Communist by chance.
Extract of the (very long) document you read about MH17: "The ticket is absolutely not intended to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent".
The Minister for Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
From the propaganda?
In Alexandre Castals, where do you have these details about the macabre?
From the Ukrainian army (she unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (possible to say anything)?
ALLEEEEEZ Romania!
All right, you're in Hungary!
I'm telling you that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the contrary.
That's what I'm saying, I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the local authorities who has not stopped denouncing the Romanian football until the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Cooperative" before the start of the season whose team would win the championship, which teams were in Europe, which would be relegated, and which would keep money to its size, mainly by selling players who were well below expectations.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, had been doing business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but apparently he had been counseled by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have cost him an innocent sentence), and was taken for 3 and a half years.
The trial also valued the prison for the Becali brothers, four club owners, Steaua Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for crimes related to football.
George Becali also earns a penalty for trying to do (and then dissimulate the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the champion, to win the title and win the jackpot of the League of Champions.
The team he tried to do was our neighbor from Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first Cluj champions, while they were rejected.
I'll always be able to do so much right now.
In the dissimulation of this attempt on corruption was involved, among others, Piturca, who signed as a false document suggesting that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a land sale.
So this uneducated poor man, an idiot, a liar and a liar don't represent me, and he'll never do it.
The Hungarians are just a band of nationalists of our day.
You might think that after the last time they broke down the stairs of the stadium and shops, and where they burned racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but not.
I think Neil Lennon was trying to get back to Al-Ittiqad.
Wherever it ends, it will be a disappointment after Stockport County has rejected it.
Super article.
If it were Sarkozy who had done it, we'd have heard the left to cry like a big disease.
But as it is the Dutch gentleman, friend of trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but all low.
This is why the economic environment sometimes prefers that a party complains to the left is installed in power.
These are the bankers who have financed Obama's victory, and they have not lost their investment!
"the idea is absurd that most employers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should employment be generalized by the control of beginners in 2015?
I hope that in the crowd, the tax pool, will also generalize the absolute control of so-called plutocrats, bankers, kleptocrats, tax evacuations, volorous patterns, and other malandrins.
Can you make a phrase without the words bankers or plutocrats?
You're very proud of your garden every time
That's true when we're in class: we treat the population of strangers and without teeth.
In each new period of unemployment, these are the dozens and the dozens of candidates I address to employers who are most often not even charged with a reception charge, it was automated.
It is also the total absence of follow-up or support from the Employment Party.
To conclude, I will add that the "socialist" pattern of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read here an article from the buried canard?
We learn that a roommate can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue looking for jobs by his own means.
It is learned that controls have allowed the radiation of people who, for more than half, were no longer affected by unemployment.
So we're asking how we can control people we've never seen.
We are asked what sanctions are a radiation for anyone who has not access to employment services or unemployment allowances.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow for more radiation, we ask ourselves what it will help recruits.
"We learn that a driver can stay several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue looking for jobs by his own means" Indeed, it is shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done a great deal about racism in the foot no longer?
Should we throw them out of the EU?
The EU was the only economic source and should remain.
The aim is not to be a "police of thought".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It doesn't make any sense about an economic plan.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is Europe's most innocent society.
What equality????
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the corrupt mobilists who are the U.S.
The best solution would be to leave the whole East behind this lucrative organization and create the green.
At least we'll finally look at your football.
This antioracism cruise is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
The currency and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
What, then, is Europe going to let the United Kingdom enter?
The Uefa should appeal to them for pleasure in the comedy of Blaster and his men.
That's been happening for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Dr. Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to see little symmetrical phrases back, just a story of keeping the polymer?
Whatever it is, it's a fact that every small event towards peace, there's, there's, there's, there's, and there's people who're working to throw oil on the fire.
The decoding would mean that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli, and that this alone explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would mean that in order to resolve the question of Israeli-Palestinian, it would have to be against the Israeli identity of the armed Israeli occupying the occupying Power as a colonizer.
In 1945, instead of creating a Jewish state in Palestine to destroy an Arab population that was nothing in Shoah, it was more reasonable to see the Bavière of its German inhabitants (which they were capable of Shoah) to replace them with survivors.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to complain about and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic residents.
Mr., Take the example of Western Sahara colonization...
That Morocco is the colonialist, that's evidence!
But as for Israel, it is also necessary to inquire about history, its allies and its supporters in order to enter into the truth.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruism, we agree.
So stop your pirates to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule was colonized by the Romans but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, the Gaulois or others.
In Palestine, there is a discrimination based on origin.
In addition, the State of Israel is defined as one of a "Jewish people" in which no non-Jewish will be able to participate.
The State of Israel discriminates against the non-Jewish, where they are happy.
Conclusion: In order to resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break up with the evils that oppose Jews and non-Jewish.
In Maghreb, some people have even been baptized in the name of their first status by this lifesaving civilization!
Two facts that must be ignored.
Firstly, the Zionist European project (colonise to fit Palestine) involved the deposition of Palestinians, which was therefore an internal anti-Palestinian project, the solution needed to break with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has been missing since the start.
Their eternal result will give them what the dogs will die.
He should start his rehabilitation with small shoes.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite of the game.
So much suffering, including racial injuries and physically hard tacs in football, but Suarez was punished too long.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the Puritans say.
Yes, I hate all those molars.
The football is a sport of contact where the tiles exist and, as a result, players will be hurt.
The fact that his teeth are in the flesh of an enemy to have the advantage did not ensure his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 steps to have performed a similar management.
It's now the third time Suarez did this.
If you kill someone at work.
What would be the effect on you?
I knew someone was going to die.
If you're dyslexic, I'm sorry.
I'm slightly dyslexic.
I'm sorry for this mess with two balls.
I'm afraid he had to come back to play with his teeth full of teeth.
All these words games on Suarez are losing their killer.
I failed to kill the enemy.
An essential condition for a good school course is respect for students of their teachers and the school institution.
This applies if parents are to blame for this respect for their children.
Parents communicate this respect more easily if they feel respected by their children’s teachers and school.
In the good institutions of those who make their students progress, parents are considered as partners, not as imm.
Who can believe that it is the professor who should do all the work (learning, education, learning respect, limits, living together short) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the fee.
But it's no doubt easier to take her to school.
Mistake on parents is not operational.
No one really cared about them.
Then when the action is taken, it will remain limited.
On the contrary, the school institution could have a lot of things.
Operational solutions are available.
The actors (profess, hierarchies and Ministry) should play their role there and do not continue to be affected.
A group can be disbanded to relax, not families.
Don't talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
It's like being teachers, but the first role of school is forgotten.
Transmit knowledge.
And if it requires parents there, the school ensures the instruction of their children.
What is the Minister who is about to put in place what was called the Public Instruction.
Next article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Do you really expect an intelligent comment from this morning of the east whales?
It's a beauuf, it's clear, but I think it's rather Willoughby, and so on the North coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
Not surprisingly, there was a budgetary urgency.
Let it fall and the economy will rise immediately.
Hunters Hill, in fact.
Real estate
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His election is the seat of Sydney Nord.
Indeed a drink from the North coast!!!
Well, if British BBC TVs wanted to compare the non-conservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously have concluded that they were led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It's going on for a grinche, today. :(
Yes, but his good leader let him go on his hunger regularly.
You will also be more generous if you wake up in the morning and realize that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legitimate and illegal benefits will remain beyond your scope.
Pauvre Joe.
It's really pathetic.
He tried half to present a budget and then left.
At least he doesn't threaten to hurt anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to order, without gas turbines, in a distant country and to call for State aid.
And as she can make the lobbying, don't be afraid of the result.
And so bad for the job in France that she has nothing to do, she's always looking forward to getting married when their company has losses on the markets, especially outside...
it is just because their lobbying has not worked but the order has been cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or an arrangement for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been completed.
Now, to know if it's okay or not and how BF's going to comply with the law anyway, it would be nice to know that "the world" thinks about it!
The Brittany Ferries company is detained by the legumes of Bretons.
Those who burn the centers of taxes and fraud.
They want state aid.
That they didn't seem to me at least normal.
And as far as a ship is armed with a métropolitan fleet is 30% more expensive than any other civilized balloon, it is normal to wait a while for the State.
Or we are condemned to tolerate the British monopolies on the market.
That's the choice.
It is an eternal French problem that considers its seafaring faces as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where there are sometimes different people from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, no investment, no short notice.
One of the reasons why Britain must find its sovereignty.
That's it, and then they'll create the Breton Balloon with equipment exclusively composed of pure breads.
With this, of course, they're going to lower the costs in a significant way...
You heard me.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything that was related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond the alone Hackett career, which has always been closer to the spirit of Genesis in the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
In fact, they do not mention Gabriel’s work only no longer.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "disgusting everything that relates to the prog," as they are about to broadcast a documentary of an hour and a half on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the only projects of its members.
As for the alone career of Hackett, which would be “closer to the spirit of Genesis in the 1970s, ” I do not agree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, to play a set of Genesis songs on which he has several degrees of participation and to claim to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to collect a half-final demo bag and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
Curiously, Bank's first solo album is absolutely brilliant, and in fact in the spirit of Genesis of the 70s.
They've gone beyond the alone Hackett career because, we're honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been made if they had not had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I have not always seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups such as King Crimeson and Gintle Giant who have an interesting story but lack the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good note.
I would say even if the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it's ADORAIT the progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest calls "predicted": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
The chance is absolutely great.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a terrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is an obvious success.
There will always be a difference between a convicted criminal and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his misunderstanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him from vision and reflection make him the fairest and wisest of a society.
I mean, they have no excuse.
They're indefinable.
Yes, we had your point of view, the first time already.
This is exactly where you live, Mr LeClos.
There must be a very different spirit from the community of mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his misintended understanding of things.
But this is also the result of pain, hatred, guilt among the neighbors of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never prevail against those who decide wisely about the death of others from health and just reason of their pedestal.
However, in an attempt to balance the analysis, we could also claim that the death penalty has often committed wild violence, which he has been able to play against people who have made it free of charge.
The neighbors of these unfortunate victims will likely experience their pain caused by the disappearance of the one who was the storm, sometimes the torturer, the loved one and the one who sustains their nights.
Let's not put them off.
Thank you Emilio for this thought I find very fair.
The article is strong and loving.
About Marc Asnin, he proved great intelligence.
The one in the heart.
That's certainly what I've read more just for a long time.
However, it would be believed to read the stories of another time, old things, that the barrier of the past would be forgiven, and here are the dates that lie, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I don't really think Philip Roth is so great.
Similar to the other two "American Romances" mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all superseded.
I thought you stopped the white man.
What does that mean?
Roth is great, better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is definitely better than this Penitentiary Bellow, who received the price.
Perhaps Nobel's judges of this year decided that if we had to have an American laureate, we could have a [read] racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They produce all "genio novels" as if it were a literary kind.
They're homonymous Joseph against...
What have you got?
How many DeLillo books do the anti-DeLillos have?
I've never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Do you have The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, more fat, smaller, and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'm going to end a day underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who pretends to live in the same world as I do and have enough books from DeLillo to reject his talent of writing, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would he have fought??
It's of simple interest.
It was a homour treaty, "the law", not a definition request.
Between the text and the spirit, it appears here that the lady has acted in the UN only interestedly, and not in the institution she represented, that we are asking what the term "conflict" is going to do.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take a very good look!
Yes, State services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating the value, or they have not prevented it from being dangerous.
After we understand that French employees are not dynamic and seek only peace.
The waterproof areas that become constructive on the next day when a large construction program will be launched are classic and not only on a low-cost basis.
Look at alluvial mountains near the rivers.
We were told that "from our day, there are no more floods thanks to the regulatory barriers."
Now, we need to expand the backrests and cross the fingers.
But this will be due to state services, of course...
Is it on the ground, on the whole of promotion?
A few lands.
So 6 million euros.
It's clearer, right there, the interest?
Sort the calculator and you're going to dream of the life you could have in place at Ms. Babin's place, the first UMP associate of La Faute sur Mer and the former president of the Urbanism Commission, who allows you to build!
The two mothers of the Sarkozysme Triomphant are the old and the real estate.
I'm from the left and not from all sympathizing with Sarko, but svp, not from the political low or low cuts of all Azimuts, we're not in there in a battle of powerful bugs.
I wonder if the tiles involved in these recent fossils were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. girls are violent criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So what the hell do you think you're doing, you?
The United States isn't a shithole.
Yes, the American girls are tired of the raccoons they've been dealing with every day.
Of course, none of them ever do anything, but the girls "come out because they're racist".
Here's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the U.S., and it is unfortunate that an incident like that occurs in order to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You're ignoring him here.
The good flicks must denounce the corrupt racist flickers.
VENDEZ-LES!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism isn't here.
Is this the first time you participate in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you're accused of being ignorant while it's obviously you who don't play anything - of many sources (US sources) have noted the permanent problem of racism in the United States (not obsessive speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent of the tension on this subject at this time.
As a result, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in various ways, where treatment is carried out by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the birth of some and I am shocked by the false birth of VA and others.
And where do you think the investigators find their information?
On the Internet?
They will question the responsible, speak to them, resulting in confidence.
That Man goes to the Elysiana has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is recovery, verification, analysis.
And that's where we understand that the chocolates were interested in doing it.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a case-by-case anti-sarcozysm basis (a non-place and no conviction) that seems to have been convicted by judges (2 brought in correction), two Dutch friends journalists.
If this corruption that is revealed between justice, politics, executives and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, your spirit is blinding you!
RV with Holland...
And of course all that is only coincidence and not teleguided!!! ...
If you think that only Sarkozy's supporters are innocent!
From the extract I could read, the VA article makes it just to drag the arroser.
I've even had such a big deal.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of disappearing because journalists are not "astrins" in the secret of sources, is it not?
In contrast, there seems to be no connection between VA and power, while there seems to be confusion between the world's power and journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the world about the background and its dangerous relationships.
We are well in front of a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
From where this editorial to the Aborigines, which has long said about the complexity with the current government.
It's not a matter of right or left, it's more serious.
I'd think the island was going well with the smoked shark!
It's just for figures and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I'm sure if I was a second-generation immigrant who was happy because my parents had come here I would have doubts about the issue of immigration, but that's not a reason to resist the controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC issue on immigration was Sikh of the second generation who said that she was on the side with the number of people who entered and the changes they had made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not of all co-operatives, even refusing to give up just a drink because of the woman's religion, he also refused to go into her place of worship even though she told him that he was not obliged to pray.

As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whatever limits and answers it must be admired even if it is a public director:) How much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left, it would be Communist.
According to you, what did the New Labor do, especially on the left?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS is repeated, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms for the well-being of the right of the land), the culture of social benefits, the age of the whole, the right politics that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is of the right and not of the community, I said this to bloke, which I mean, they have managed a very high percentage of the population in order to make them independent of the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your arguments ready as much as you want, but what I asked you is specific examples of left-wing policy, or a right-wing program defended by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all my respect, that's not what you asked Daniel Johnson asked what the New Labour had done that was particularly right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you requested.
Yes - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, shares the situation of his parents with those of the economic migrants who are now in Great Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He had every reason to do so.

You should renegotiate the treaties you'll tell me.
Or, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" is still a meaning in Europe, what should it do?
Unfortunately, the Commission is not concerned about the long-term tax competition between countries for companies.
That must be a lot of refuse.
Europe's not the solution, it's the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail sector fully marketed.
In the end, this means that entire breads in the French territory will no longer be served by the rail.
The departure that has already been caused by many territories will only make it stronger.
Every sacrifice, including the advantage of a country, on behalf of the liberal dosa didn't seem like a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that it will have to deal well with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has been released for a long time.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but they do not have the means to make it difficult to meet their commitments.

It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you, of course, are still coming to the end of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic life so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is exciting and very difficult.
That said, it would seem to me to start the separation process between your life and the complications you have inherited.
We'd say it's what they do, but it's hostile to me.
Since you all live as close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones become surfaces, do you think of a "plan" of "out" so that you can make a difference between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a sympathetic real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure on the court, they can be resolved.

Very good advice.
My counsel, ask the children what they want to do, even if this means meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever.
Warn them that they will not have his promises about contact and ask them to reflect on how this would make them feel and how they will manage the disappointment if they do not have their own responsibility.
Try to keep them in touch with their father.
If they see that you do this for their good, despite your own feeling about the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you, and if you do all you can to facilitate a father/child relationship, they will be grateful when they are older.
I believe that children end up understanding who's wrong, if they're allowed to see things by themselves.
Going a little further you are close to Godwin point.
It is raining, in 30-40 years civilization will have disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, that is the power of land against the power to do so.
In addition to globalization, the country which is doing at least social, tax, but also environmental, has a competitive advantage, and others are obliged to follow.

These are not the climatesceptics that produce C02.
It is the whole world Those who heat themselves, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in dwellings that have failed to build, those who buy industrial products that they have to produce and transport.
These are not the climatesceptics that have shown against echotax, but truckers.
No policy is climate-optic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climates send more than CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not suffice.
There is also a need for political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on car, etc.).
And politicians act partly according to the sensitivity of their electorate.

The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our retirements, to look at our old, to see their hygienic pools, to bury 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your milk and your bunnet, which enables you to recover, to increase the heating ET to eat this sandwich at breakfast).
Don't be like me.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a lie or is it not made out?

Here's how public money is spent to allow an infinity minority of individuals to spend good time in the space making gypsies and round the clowns while playing in front of the TV cameras.
Therefore, the reality of the television has nothing to do with the fact that the authorities expect a baby to be designed here to expand the world and retrieve the media coverage to Western kingdoms that are used to the mothers of the tablets.
They may have to go back to the ground to find out we're burning here!
Unlike what you think, we don't send men or women into space to make gypsies or clowns, but to work.
And these work is very useful to mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily life are the result of space research.
So, yes, it's money that's useful.
You can quote only one thing that improves our daily life and derives from space research.
It's just a chilly smell.
the bill style that works the point in the air (for example to write to the ceiling)
To pay for his treaties?
To participate in the manufacture of an unusable product?
Or suggest how to make more money for investors?
Bref, working to work doesn't mean anything, it's even the vacancy.
I'm the last one to play high.
After the infinity of individuals entering the space, there are several tens of thousands of others working on what is possible.
You know, people who worry about what, including more and more private companies, especially about driving the train to the station.
If you want to buy a plastic gun...
But those who don't think to buy plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
This may be the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic cup was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to trick people into believing that it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
The plastic holes may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it have hurt the author/editor rather than put a picture of the "eep" in question instead of the generic photos of "plastic apples"?
Or is it even curious to ask yourself what the inscription (if any) that appeared above?
Mauvai's typical report is based on the fact that "this is not just a plastic sword" and not on the inspired Jihadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The family of Dirani, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that seek to overthrow the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people would stop arguing about the fact that plastic shoes are harmless.
In their hands they can be deadly.
Even the little covered ones we give in the fast rest can feed the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the smile given by the author.
It is not difficult to try to make a "ha, ha, a plastic knife", the fact that you have expressed it actually supports its argument.
I saw on the occasion these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or stones on the walls, they never had the threatening air, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus Christ, you're right.
And that makes all her sense right now...
I've seen this guy who's been in the Middle East at Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic bags to anyone all night!
I love the conclusion.
All the wonderful news, often technology, gives many people the idea that it is a right and a need to gain it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a fixed cost (abbreviation, electricity consumption) that exists in the budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies will result in frustration.
For example, call on the Solidarity Energy Pact, which allows you to isolate the coins of a house for a symbolic €1 when it is used by a modest home (work costs are actually charged by the energy suppliers!).
Simple but uneven even if more than 3,000 houses were so isolated this year!
I'm interested in this PES.
But I've never heard of it.
Who can call them and how does it work?

The study shows that a 4-person family can reduce by 30% its water bill (from 150 m3/year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of the water economy per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
This is not a crisis of demand, it is a crisis of the system that is no longer able to produce enough surplus (if it then redistributiond in the form of real-time income increase) so that these surpluss will bear the increase of the expenditure you are classified in the category "containing expenditure".
In other words, energy precarience is "just" the reverse of the average of the fact that the economy is no longer growing as quickly as it would like.
Note that the theory (neo-)classical of the economy is completely unable to answer such a question, because for it there is no internal limit to economic growth, and there is no element which is likely to impose, more and more strongly, the pace of economic growth after a decade.
From its very definition (in physics), energy is what enables all physical transformation to be achieved.
Because, basically, it's transforming, energy is this way to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any obstacle to energy growth (i.e., "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, is bound to increase production (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive).
Bref, there is a very strong link between energy precarnation and the fact that it comes, or not, to increase the "production" of non-carriage energy.
And the very official data published, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only grow in the years and decades to come (the AEA, in these recent reports, clearly indicates that the production of conventional oil was achieved in 2008, i.e. no oil.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very strong energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and there was nothing left to be done, so it's the same thing.
Take this to France!

You're a Guardian's webmaster?
As noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
In fact, the boys work well.
Although many English people like to move from Scotland when they just lose, there is nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get away from the first tower.
It's even more rigid if we're playing against them;)
England is beginning to worry about me.
Because, now that the "shige expensive generation" is removed, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the XIs of the start, why change a team that gets?
The only English football player who, in my humble opinion, was really "of the international class", is David Beckham, a little efficient, maybe, but I think if he wore a patent like me, he would completely exaggerate me.
People forget their athletic constitution, too, by talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I've never been sick of Ecossais.
I'm going to be surprised to see their hot colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English football player who, in my humble opinion, was really "of international class", is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is true that Juppe would have been wrong to ask for EUR 100000 for a South Korea conference.
And it's not about what he'd get if he asked them...
You mean people are coming to fix a good cut?
For the rest, I'd be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, does not only live on its Members' wages...
I am particularly concerned about what he can say in his conferences.
How to reduce his deficit?
How to get back to full-time?
I would say that no serious conference on a scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if it is entitled to a Nobel Prize, will not require a minimum sum.
Conferences with content are most of the free or almost time.
And I can assure you that these young people are really working and that the results presented in their conferences – welcome – are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the implementation of these two figures is constructive.
The researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It's all clear to me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a representative of UMP ethics
I'm like the impression we're calling him to win the money????
I'm far from being one of his fans, but we're calling him bad (or deceitfully) to manage his campaign OK.
But holding conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, we recall that her transfers are being charged by the taxpayers.
Epidemiology rule n°1: isolate.
All American and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politics.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What degree of infection of the population is that politicians will resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to leave Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola is operating in West Africa, I see it very well to ban all flights and ships in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods to say...
What harm the international media panic on Ebola is no longer used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West Africans.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It's such a sad journal article, a big title so low.
I could read every paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first ones to care - read - Men travel from community to community, etc.
Such more intelligent comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to better understanding and understanding cultural and sociological approaches, and the differences in the role of sex that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Let's go, think about it and write it, we're not happy to do the noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are unable to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before writing?
Although I put the female genital mutilation on the same level as the disappearance - a form of terrorism as barbarous as it is, its survival rate does not make it a different form of torture - it says that its temporary suspension is a "pestilence" beyond understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is Sierra Leone, which can give some degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case, of course, it does not give a better perspective than that of a middle activist in the street.
And I believe that the Guardian was in the process of "morning" as a global resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, extending its fundamental requirements.
Who, in the editorial team, let this appear?
For a territorial election or other money does not matter.
I read without delay that the territorial public function is increasing its effectiveness, and I have never seen an article giving them words or trying to explain why.
What would be legitimation, actually.
There will be no doubt lies and facts to separate us from the good grain of the grape.
The court of accounts costs to meet so many economic disadvantages.
It's true that they've never had anything to do with the people of Cambodia Street.
CTs are not in deficit, they have funding needs that can only relate to the investments they make.
It's hard to use too much concepts as the world makes the game of all obscenities.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective property
Unfortunately, the financial debt is mainly of operating costs...
And as the executive surplus (for example, to make beautiful round-points) carries a growing and uncompromising load (required load up to their deaths, because they work on life + retirement), these communities are growing in investment.
It is therefore necessary to delete the staff member's status prior to the reduction of the appropriations.
It is also responsible for financial accountability for the mayors.
It is wonderful that the inter-communitys should be accompanied by a reduction in the Community's effectiveness and that this is the reverse that is happening, as evidenced by the fact that it is not effective without the removal of others.
How do you want to manage large territories as large as cacahuettes at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse when these territories were created is a revolution, perhaps it would be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay imprisoned, worse English, in the administrative system, to stop him!
Let's try even hard, it's not too hard to explain the blockade situation in which the state of the Veme has led with its provisional men.
It actually started with Petain.
Then he went on to join the series "by the edge of the breath" coming strong about.
Why are they not going to live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco above a movie to leave all this suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind "is the fault of the whites."
"response" does not "response"
I sincerely hope it's the sarcoma.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we take off to be the first one.
Whether it's sarcism or not, there's an argument to go through.
It is now agreed that modern-day Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa some 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly cold period about 150 thousand years ago, they have been able to travel to the North to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand years ago) has been part of the history.
The current Minister of Defence had said a few months ago that no military hospital would stop.
So he's lying.
There was no doubt the only government that seemed to have the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Let go of me!
in 2017:Transformation in a comfortable special hotel with expensive posters for future withdrawals from the Republic ?
Moving from the stage dedicated to Berty?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for Nantis and their families, the " Grand V " care of a doctor at 3 speeds.
We're going to save the money, and the soldiers will take care of the little one else's flu.
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, all horizons?
The London Waps?
I loved their fans that are based on Wycombe/London.
How are London Irish and London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just the waps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
This changes that a football team uses the territory of a rugby club instead of the inverse.
In addition, external movements for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the shame of being bought by the Chambers Sharks, and we ended up celebrating our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I'd say the same thing.
The way they tried to get on the ground, although they had access to other places, did not favor us.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
This must be frustrating for a team that has no bad support and that has been up to the top for more than 30 years to see its stage restored by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent problems of the CCFC, but this must be a good idea.
For my part, I'm not the club's ruby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't do it on the part of some Waps fans at work.
Are they and a few thousands of other people in the South-East going to follow them away or are they supposed to support another team now?
Good article pro-domo and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But why, then, are not all computer systems based on these concepts ??????
+because a giant mass of programs exists (cobol, java), +because all systems don't need them, +because there's no magic bags ++....
And because for most of the computer systems, bugs are not really important, what counts is being the first on the segment.

But they're selling us.
Real-time information has become a key sector in many areas, and few are aware of the intimate details of these processes.
15 years ago, I didn't go to an Olive Garden.
The price report was low.
I'm sorry for those who will lose their job, but it's better to close the box.
I would recommend a more simple menu with choices that are popular.
Reduce costs and prices.
There are already too many salts in our food systems.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to leave you alone in the future.
It should be said that they reason with Faisons more benefits, and not Fasons of the healthier areas and the best quality-primary report.
They're taking us for pimps.
Ah, yes, pay attention to what people didn't have to go too far.
And then we make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt that you must add to the water of pasta is negligible, but this greatly favours the taste of the finished product.
This is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way the potatoes eat.
The final product is so much better.
Without it, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to the company kitchen.
Do you have family restaurants and offer cheap, affordable flats at a reasonable price?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
It's an accident at work that's been bad.
A young promiser, who learned to fly, followed his father's career in prison to kill him.
A man has lost everything and has violently interrupted this birth vow.
If he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, he seemed to be the least.
Where are we going?
All right!
That smell!
The desire to discover is obvious and difficult to forgive and to blame at the same time...
Indeed, it is difficult to apologize for the desire to discover it.
That's what makes me feel some sympathy for a 15-year-old dog.
During the trial, the father of the gamma complained that he never saw his son again but no longer apologized to the relatives of the type he himself killed.
Who's really the victim in this story?
What's all the mix?!!?
The father of the game was condemned for what he did.
With regard to the Connery of Lost Balls, the accused and guilty, he knew quite well that the Balls were dangerous.
The gamma did nothing to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
10 years, it's a bit of my opinion.
To have the intelligence to go to this young man to make the noise?
Actually, it's broken!
If the opportunity is available, take vacations in the valley of the Mosule and sleep in the B&B of one of the small vitivators.
This is twice that I do it, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
In addition, if you're there during one of the many wine festivals held in each community, it's even better.
I'm sorry, Moselle's valley, I fell too fast.
It is a pleasure to see that the German wine is recognized.
Note, rather importantly, German vineers traditionally use only one variety of roots, which means they must really burn hard to preserve a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience different races, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is nothing but the region of the Moselle that must be recommended - France, the Palestinian Rhine (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French area of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German style (or maybe it's the reverse, short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in a bottle of property are so complex, the sweeter is extremely balanced.
Try Schloss Fullrad's spats with a thermal host next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online to have a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a good guide, supremely illustrated.
I understand very well that there will be new readers from the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a summary of each article on German wine since the night.
From time to time, there is an article on German wines that are coming, the new seeds of Baden that are now going to accompany the plates, the roses that are extremely strong, but above all, it's not those Libfraumilch that people used to be when they were young (you, I don't really think that this is always true or exciting, unless I'm going to be more than 40 years old - who, as I say, will already see it all).
Closing the Val de Grae would be a serious mistake and an illustration of the sad state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and an epileptic in the foot of my grandpa and my grandson who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote in the House of Members: these Chambers of Ministers, which are held by the Barbachet, and those decisions taken at the close of the House, have become unacceptable.
Sorboroin's right.
It should do the same in the Green Sun: euthanasia at 70 years.
In addition, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor (sic) assets because they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work in our hommers, real job, and you will no longer have problems with disability!
For the elderly, time has come to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The assets, by way of disappearance, will not be able to have only this demographic transition...
So of the hierarchy, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of the 30 famous.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (this has been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will be forced to rethink all the model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of medical excellence in France: a certain rigidity and discipline that we knew more in the public hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
First we're wrong because the rest of the hospitals aren't at the top.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are also taking care of the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase in the offer of public service in other hospitals than in maintaining a medicine at two speeds.
The Val is a pool of French medical excellence, and well understood a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a sign of further progress towards the mediaty of France.
Without talking about the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The hospitalization day price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Department with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalling Agencys.
The absorption of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, who came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had.
In almost all countries of the world, a child born in this country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries with children born from Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not respond to some very high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why??
It seems to me to take two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to end all the persecutions and ill-treatment and war that make people of their countries flee and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he does not want people to come by boat, then he has to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what's happening during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returned to normal.
Everything makes sense now, number...!
Strangely, British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe in this little superhero when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron has condemned the crimes of war and the ill-treatment that still existed.
A number of European countries have since suspended the Tamouls' sports with links to the LTTE, thinking that they would risk torture on their return.
UNHCR revised its assessment guidelines on asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with links with LTTE be considered at risk of returning.
The year [2013] saw a number of attacks by Buddhist groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Take it easy, boys!
Mr. Nowak, he's gone to the kitchen with so much periodical.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
He didn't have the health insurance in the States?
So I wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas maybe, unless some lab pay for the porchuse of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help come later.
Especially in Texas
Ah aah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is still a little more, we were told that the Ebola kills as quickly as a large epidemic was impossible (there is a scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contamination of the wounded was zero.
The more we find out, the more I'm afraid.
You have to read newspaper roles to believe that a risk may be zero.
It's impossible to see three small but not zero.
Finally, c is a scientific reality, more a virus is fatal rapidly (generally) less likely to spread because the death of the host means its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes comes from the Spanish flu.
Apres c is the general quarter to save mankind. ..
There is nothing obscenities to do before mediated by certain mild and virtuoso, but to the destruction of thousands of other African diseases that we did not know about the meteer, the beard, or the verbs?
Of course, this brings to light the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but the repetition of the announcements is a terrible division.
Freedom of expression, so much love of conservators.
Suspension was to keep doctors under control.
I ask how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms with regard to freedom of expression and the right to private life of Australians.
I think they had never imagined that their five conservators would have violated their rights to freedom of expression.
I'm wondering how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I guess there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that is exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A hot tour for when the problem becomes really out of control.
There are not enough doctors already working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to participate in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy on medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new end-of-market fund for medical research, which should reach $20 billion by 2020, would certainly be just a black emergency case for the budget.
Using the noble medical research forecast, it will collect $20 billion and, on a later date, transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we don't want to believe.
He explained that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the end-market fund for medical research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the low incomes.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
In the end, the "falser rounder" and its Telstra Markets Fund were excellent tutors.
If this isn't fair, then we'll show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is even the "old personality"...
I also noticed it, quite corrosive as you notice.
If only he could warn her to keep a buzz on her constantly..
The worst destination for a career policy: not recognised in the street.
Welcome She has not been recognized in her town of Toul as being sufficiently high to manage it.
How good the good sense of "provincial" is!
We're living an awful time, Mrs. Morano.
I'm sure I'm against the port of the burqa, but that's not the question.
As for this anecdot, it is sarcosis in the state: a minority of medics with the rank of ministers, a confusion between the government function and the executive function (if Sarkozy could come with his head on each side of the road to show that he is well-guarded by public order), the magnitude and compliance with their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" that have been developed to carry a fire weapon and a sign, which would thus have allowed them to perform their self-proclaimed function as judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is actually the main teaching of the matter: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they don't even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it's gonna turn out to be for him.
I want this agent who would ignore the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the cup
I don't agree, thanks to her we're well adjusted...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, she'd have to invent it!
It's easy, however, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde bead.
On what score, N.
Morano appeared in the horrors actually, in the humiliation of the police officer she was facing, and who would have no doubt had to multiply the curves and the "Yes, ma'am, of course, Madame, you tell me, Madame in what direction I should run to get me out of this road without waiting for this woman."
“In one case, the Australian Super Hornets left an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too important....”
The Americans are not bad at this, but I think even when Isis is going to pass them or have already done it, in Iraq at least one of the bodies now no one does.
As for the civilian deaths on the industrial scale, nothing matches Western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-occupational) between the two wars of Iraq would cost millions of Iraqis, particularly children, elderly people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions for the "war machine".
Are you also the kind of guy who prefers sanctions to order and men on earth?
Very good note - the United Nations has been acting incredibly hard and unconsidered in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and are not able to touch the elite - there is no doubt a reason why they have the temporary approval of the Security Council itself.
You may recall that in the recent war in Iraq, the insurers have not lost time to mark their main enemy.
This was the attack on the United Nations Mission QG that they had arrived five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and twice, and I imagine with satisfaction and blood-fried.
As brutal and hard as this bombing is, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a UN mission was targeted like this.
Well, note, I actually forgot that.
Therefore, add half a million people to the total number of deaths of the western nations (at least with the recent difficulties in Ukraine the economic activity was directed directly towards those who intended to harm them).
This does not help your argument but to exaggerate untrustworthy statistics.
The same vaguely reliable figures of deaths related to sanctions are those of children under 5 years of age and they are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors to identify the facts.
Of course, it was in his interest to ignore the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
With regard to additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than hypotheses.
Since the number of pre-sanctions in at least five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is widely shared with this age group.
Of course you need to fear it, but also the gift of gammas in general.
It must stop doing as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that they could be made with strangers that neither parent nor child might ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French are the source of genetics.
It's an important and unfathomable thing to know its origins.
Instead of doing as if it were obvious and using fantastic arguments, we should explain what serious problems a child can face for adopted or designed with a gift of gamma.
If you learn that your parents who raised you did not provide the gammas that you are out of, you can send them to you, in my opinion, because they would have committed no crime.
The latest advances in the PMA (e.g. virus seizures) are at least as controversial as a reasonably well-framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: the frustration of the desire for children justifying these beliefs and this has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just like a point.
Of course, the GPA has to be feared, that's what this stupid issue is.
Of course, it's sad not to have children when we want it.
It's a problem I've met with my husband.
However, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming ill, contracting serious illness, losing all its children in an accident, etc.
Among all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well consumerized, GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a caprice where the other one can be used according to his good will.
Sterility calls for reflection and acceptance.
