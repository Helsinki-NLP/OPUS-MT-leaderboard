A rapid increase in coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The combined incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) demonstrates similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although in different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve their preparation for an island of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical attention and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology neumonia was reported in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases in China reported that the cause agent was a new coronavirus now known as Coronavirus 2 of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without neumonia, and that most of them are recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalised by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine trends in the combined incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (EU) and compare them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the RU with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and RU countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently in the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the WHO definition of case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020 in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (EU) as from 31 December 2019 and that date including 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths have occurred in Italy alone.
Getting the accumulated amount and accumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the accounts of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country of the world, which are only obtained from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the Countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the RU and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID 19 cases reduced to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA and RU country during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the aggregate number of cases reported in each country by 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries
The trends in the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 in 14 days in EU/EEA and RU countries in general followed the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEE and the EU in general, the combined incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and RU countries showed emerging trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 similar (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries, compared with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and RU countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the RU.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that pandemics are advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries, variations in national public health responses and possibly different definitions in countries and protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed evidence.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors from the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 would require intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
The data on case admissions of COVID-19 in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of the cases, respectively (the data are not shown).
However, it should be systematically collected to complement the current monitoring data focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in each 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 intensive care and average care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios with regard to the satisfaction of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the RU of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a risk >90 % over the capacity of intensive care beds are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been aggregated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the RU countries and hospitals and intensive care units are generally addressed to a defined regional capture population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Statistical Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the RU.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained Community transmission stage of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who require medical attention and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change of a containment approach to a mitigation, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not be sufficient for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response in a manner that is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of pandemics.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, other EU/EEA health systems are likely to face a patient wave that requires intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The disease outbreak by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3,000 people and has infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, which has generated a disaster for mankind.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from mucielago and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
The COVID-19, however, has a severity and a lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects more people than young people and men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emergency disease, the purpose of this article is to provide an appropriate and complete analysis of the research topic, which is rapidly being developed.
We will deal with the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and disease prevention.
Although many questions still do not answer, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard-up and unforgettable reminder for all Chinese, who were forced to stay home during all the festival and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the Coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and associated disease was called Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and almost 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients with high data and more than 3000 patients with missing.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nni.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including its virus, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to sum up the progress in research on this new matter that is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare the COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a broken 2012).
We will also examine what is known to date about the prevention and predictive of disease, as well as some crucial questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of the common colds 4.
In this century, however, we have found two times with highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused a outbreak in China in 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third by coronavirus of what is recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, conglomerates of unknown origin neumonia were first informed of 31 December 2019 by Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, he came to know the sequence of the coronavirus.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine and all public transport were suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with Wuhan's marine market, which was considered the site of infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared to be a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, disease has already spread across China and almost 50 countries worldwide (Figure 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the crime cannot be determined yet.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented a more recent illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people from all ages, but mainly people from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were infected were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 was expanded into larger conglomerates in Hubei and around it.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) would pass between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate in patients with confirmed cases was 144% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate in the overall population was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (masculine), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and complex viruses that contain a single-sensitivity ARN.
It can be divided into four genes, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoron virus are the ones that infected humans.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and peptidase 4 (DPP4) dipeptidil for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, are added to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 enzyme (ACE2) and the peptidal dipeptidil 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the membranes are released.
The viral Arn gene is released to cytoplasma; after replication of the viral gene, the genomic Arn, together with the glucoproteins of the environment and the nucleocapside proteins, the form of virion containing viruses, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huan market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrasound sections of the human respiratory epithelial.
It was determined that ACE2 is a recipient of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S protein S of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the Orf3b and a secret protein coded by the Orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNb; however, the Orf8 does not contain any known domain or function.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the structure of the ECE2's electronic microscopy of complete length in resolution 2.9 Å, in conjunction with the B0AT1 transporter amino acid.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed compliance, was gathered as a teller, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex may combine two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be converted into a therapeutic diana for drug study in order to remove SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the average host
It is known that SARS-CoV and MercS-CoV were born in muciélagues and were transmitted to humans through pipes and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was considered that the mucielago is the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in a 96% to two coronavirus similar to SARS of muciélagues called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZXX21.
However, it is still unknown what intermediate host helped the virus cross the range of species to infect humans, and still dilucent the transmission route.
Ji, et al., proposed to serpins as carriers of the virus of mucielaga virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that bananas (long hockey mammals that are fed with hormones and commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a genetic homology of 99% in a corona virus discovered in bananas and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % spread by the total of two genotypes remains a major difference; in the end, final results are expected to provide concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days less than 20 °C with a moisture of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and temperature at 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ether, ethanol at 75 %, a chlorine-defectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective to disable the virus.
All the human population in general is lacking immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
As a result, we can only repeat previous studies with other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4.4).
In general, after the virus invasive to the host, it is first recognised by the inhumane system of the host through the pattern recognition receivers (PRR), including the type-C readers, the Toll receptors (TLR), the NOD receptors (NLR) and the RIG-I receptors (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflamatory factors, the growth of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic fagocysis of viral antibodies.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may help the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response takes place in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, perform an important function in the defense.
The T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly kill infected cells with the virus.
Cooperative T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses may inhibit the functions of T cells by induceing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodys, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated excretion of a recovered patient neutralizes the MercS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, the multi-orgian failure and even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by conglomerate appearance, is more likely to affect older people with constipation and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are committed to have a higher risk of infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and was between 0 and 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the time of effective quarantine according to the more accurate incubation period; this is how it will be prohibited for persons infected with asthma to transmit the virus to others.
As usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected normally should stay in custody for 14 days.
Should the quarter extend to 24 days?
Fibre is often the main and initial symptoms of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptoms or other symptoms such as dryness, dyskinesia, muscle pain, malady, headache, throat pain, kidney pain, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dementia or hypoxaemia a week after the disease appeared.
In serious cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory and acute fever, even without pulmonary anomalies in image studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study of late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98 per cent for fever, 76 per cent for drying, 55 per cent for dementia and 3 per cent for diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients would require respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dryness (47%) and dysnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80 per cent of these would require respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the greater flexibility of MERS with regard to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and gastrointestinal pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99%-100%), dryness (29%-75%), dysnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat pain (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
For 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66 576 worldwide.
Similarly, the mortality of SARS for November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high and rose to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only oscillating between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-COV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a capacity to spread more than the MSRS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its flexibility is less than the last of these two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of conglomerates often occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle as a cross.
Patients usually have prior travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact people or patients in the two weeks prior to their arrival.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients given high hospital status can re-compensate the virus, a warning signal that the time of the quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the time frame.
For example, linfopenia was observed with a protein content of <4×109/l, including a Linfocits content of <1×109/l, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of hepatic and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in some patients, and Reactive C protein and erythrocyte seduction were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimero-D, a product of fibrine degradation present in the blood, was high, and the content of lymphocytes was gradually reduced.
Anomalies are detected in most patients with COVID-19 toracic radiographs, characterized by shadow or oscillating glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA is produced, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II neuronots decreases the surface level and increases the surface tension, reducing the lung capacity to expand and increase the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in Turkish radiographs are often parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decomposition of the neuroscientists, the formation of a hyalinic membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitial system, and multinuclear sensic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The ARN detection of SARS-CoV-2 by a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative errors, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which were no longer based solely on RT-PCR) began in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol to use the SHERLOCK based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic ARN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per sample microlitre) using a cycle of less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
As a result, new techniques can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if they are checked in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors may be more likely to provide support to patients with COVID-19, as they have experienced a variety of therapies used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MercS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These treatments include currently or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
The plasma of patients recovered for treatment is even proposed.
The pharmaceutical companies work to see who develops first antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the start and probably also attacks at a lower level other organs, such as the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve the symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high fluid oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms require extra-body oxygenation assistance (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or potentially fatal respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokines pain is the result of an increased reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Citocin storm is a systemic inflammation response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNfa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNB, IFNG and MCP-1.
These cytokines lead the immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multi-orgian failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 antireceptive monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytoquine tortoine.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokines are the modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; the blockade of IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppression of road 4 of cytokines signalling, and HDAC inhibitors.
steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation.
However, high dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary infections in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the forecast.
However, careful use of corticosteroids in low-moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the date of this analysis, the effectiveness of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the effectiveness of remDesivir has been verified, a nucleotide analogue, administered by intravenous route in a patient in the United States with COVID-19.
Remdecivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remDesivir also demonstrated the potential for inhibiting other viruses with monocatenary ARN, such as the MERS and SARS virus.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the composition of China to carry out a few trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is a great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatic impairment and other adverse reactions may occur after co-administered therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients recovered and generation of antibodies
The extraction of blood from patients who recovered from a infectious disease to treat other patients who were infected with the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not treat the disease is not new.
In fact, patients recovered tend to have relatively high levels of anti-patogenic antibodies in the blood.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other strange objects, and they recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma is extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected to 10 patients seriously ill.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and a better blood oxygen saturation.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for its use on a large scale until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered in detention.
For example, the antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which may result in fatal toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate cells B from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that would vary according to the diagnosis of a disease in accordance with the MCT theories.
Most of the active components are still unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (6.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used MCT only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had a lower recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly close comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time needed for recovery of body temperature, the absence of symptoms and hospitalization was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
What is more surprising, the rate of improvement of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the ICT continues to wait for more well-controlled trials at higher levels and at higher centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and identify the effective components of the treatment of the ICT or its combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 generally have a lot of fear of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in care also experience burnout, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoglycaemia and you, as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as the insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotrian excision, psychotic symptoms, delinquency and even suicidal tendencies.
The trace of contact and mandatory care, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 bridge, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of the infection, the quarantine and the stimuli in their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health attention should be given to patients with COVID-19, persons with suspects and persons who are in contact with them, as well as the general public who needs it.
Psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary mental health equipment, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
They are essential vaccines to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal and human reserves to susceptible guests, and they often complement antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on protein S to generate strong and long-term neutralising antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vacuums have been evaluated with live viruses exposed to animal models for SARS.
However, the inviolability of these potential vaccines in older people and models of letal stimulation and their protection against zoonoses infection should be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS was excavated 17 years ago and no new case has been registered since then.
Rather, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, similar particles to recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As a new disease, the recent COVID-19 has begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases patients can be recovered gradually without centuries.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for disease is essential for health agencies to give priority to their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on informed clinical studies up to now, the following factors may affect or be associated with the forecast of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the SARS forecast, which is also true for the COVID-19.
The COVID-19 was mainly produced in persons aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described earlier.
Patients who required more intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and complications and were significantly higher than those who did not require them (meaning 66 to 51), suggesting that age is a predictive factor of the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
complications and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require more intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart disease and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive ACE2 coagulants, which may cause hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with one another.
Abnormal laboratory results: Reactive protein level C (PCR) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible predictor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the PCR level and the severity and predictive of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of dehydrogen lactose (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT) and kinase creatinine (CK) may also help predict the patient’s evolution.
These enzymes are extensively expressed in several organs, in particular the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Finally, they constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: Torax radiographics and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prevention of clinical depletion and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as previously described, steroids are immunosuppressors that are commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammation.
As high doses of corticosteroids were extended in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteocrosis with permanent and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and during a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered an extraordinary stress, since in general they endured long periods of extreme anxiety and uncertainty, and attended the death of close family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replication in higher respiratory pathways and cause mild symptoms or do not cause symptoms in the early phase of infection, such as other coronary viruses that cause common respiratory problems.
Therefore, patients infected at a temporary or incubation phase may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which make it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV transmission would occur when patients were seriously ill, while the transmission would most often not occur at the time.
Finally, the current COVID-19 bridge is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS bridge.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, which includes the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continent continues almost all of the population with the hope of interrupting the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
While these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the deceleration of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the brake will have been completed for March and the downward phase will last for 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., believed that COVID-19, which seems to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both native and rare patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the recently identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the influence.
However, promising signals have been seen in China since the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be operational.
It was originally predicted that the Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through a continent and strict isolation, disease control has been achieved.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infection and eventually expands or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible via yours or the aliens, and possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the hexas, which created a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent 138-case study reported that 41 per cent of cases may have been caused by non-nocoma infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect people, especially medical care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and, even, transientors in contact with patients or persons infected.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of mencarillas; the use of surgical and respiratory masks with N95 (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks prevent the fluid Gothiques of a potentially infected person from being transmitted by the air or being attached to the surfaces, from which they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only N95 (group number 1860) masks can protect against inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can fully penetrate them; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measures around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five infected surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 (group number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, medical care providers should use isolation bats in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite having used a male N95; the virus may have entered his body through his infected eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use protective helmets or transparent gloves while working with patients.
For the public in general affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with more disinfectants than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary care and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and avoid spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high approval with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alarm in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens by saying that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain disease.
This message made a significant public alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was not used to contain the disease at least in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and take decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public announcements, since each word is important for citizens and can make changes in their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for the formal reports of doctors or staff; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at their time, rather than attempting to calm the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of appropriate and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the system of society's response periodically.
The COVID-19 virus caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has been spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 virus has generated the feeling of SARS recovery.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects more people than young people and men than women, and pregnancy and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a mortality greater than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even though they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in maintaining the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 was promoted much faster and more generalised than SARS-CoV.
The regular Arn trial for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients who are treated may return to the virus.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in the investigation of COVID-19, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronavirus similar to SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the mucielas.
What kind of animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus of the original host, let's say, the killers, to humans?
Without knowledge of the answers to paragraphs 1 and 2, it is not possible to transmit the transmission efficiently, and the bridge can be resuscitated at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 connects to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of respiratory pathways and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also connected to cells that express the ECE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the genetic virus evolve while it is transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, be excavated like SARS, or periodically resurfaced as flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to find answers to these questions and to many others.
However, it costs what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to our normal life.
zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Change and adaptation have led to the evolution of coronaviruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses caused mild diseases, such as the common cold.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have invested the currency in discovering how devastating and deadly human coronavirus infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus to the centre of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus infection is a zoonoses and it would be useful for us to know the zoonoses of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in the muciélagues, in which they are not pathogens.
Inter-reservation guests of certain human coronaviruses are also known.
Identification of animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could also generate important information on human coronavirus pathogens.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as in their zoonotic origins and in the transmission of species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the combination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful hospital change and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monocatenary ARN virus.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the ARN viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, in the form of the crown that they have under an electronic microscope.
As regards its structure, coronaviruses have non-semented genomes that share a similar organization.
About two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 proteins in the structure called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiga (S), in the environment (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessory proteins from each line are also codified by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified in four genes (alfacoronavirus, betaconavir, gammacoronavirus and deltacoron virus), among which the genotype of betacoronavirus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that muciellas and roeers are the source of most alfacoronavirs and betacoronavirus genes, while birds are the primary reserve of gammacoronavirus and deltacoravirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the boundaries of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five beta-ocorone viruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as common or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogens and cause severe infections of lower respiratory pathways in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary events.
The first branch of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, additional knowledge has been gained through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause autonomous symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating of the current history and infected more than 8000 people, with a severe lettuce of around 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arab peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the disease epidemic in 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in musculoskeletal, rats or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutional origin of all human coronaviruses in muciélagues, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but have a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has planted huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework to understand the natural history, the impulse force and the factors of the inter-species migration restriction.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve and the intermediate and amplifier animal guests of SARS-CoV-2, which would have significant implications for the prevention of future proliferation.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, transmission between species and pathogenicity of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parental viruses of human coronaviruses are not normally pathogens in their natural reserve hosts, but that they become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We have also examined the trend of human coronavirus evolution, in which the increase in transmissibility tends to result in the decrease in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analysed in this context.
It has been known about animal coronavirus since the end of the 1930s.
Before first isolated B814 from HCoV-229E from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, various coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as rats, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus findings in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was subsequently adapted to increase in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms such as headache, rash, general pain and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the latter was serious in lactating rats' brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and renovirus viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and are expected to be delivered predominantly during the winter season, in pre-templated climates.
In general, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had a serious infection of lower respiratory tract.
The SARS, also known as "atypical neomonia", had the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronavirus in the history of humanity, and the Ethiologic agent was the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS was remedied by the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases of 774 deaths and spread by many countries and continents.
In addition to the overproducators, it was estimated that each case could occur approximately two secondary cases, with a period of 4-7 days incubation and the occurrence of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience headache, headache, fever, general malaise and scalophrenia, followed by dementia, cough and respiratory difficulty as late symptoms.
Linfopenia, modified liver function and high levels of kinase creatinine are uncommon results in SARS laboratory tests.
Dispersion alveolar disease, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory care.
In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, several organs, including gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokines, which may be fatal, especially in immunodepressed patients.
The virus first isolated from lung biopsy in heaven from a family of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was expelled from a 7-month-old in the Netherlands by the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in small children, adult adults and immunocompressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of heart, conjunctivitis, fever and bronquiolithis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nasal sample taken by a 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
The HCoV-NL63 is associated with the obstetric laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronquiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronquiolitis acquired in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to have been associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to change to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred because of unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virological subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused serious infection of lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves to humans, they also become less viral or pathogens.
The MercS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional contact have been recorded in several European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestations are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal insufficiency, which has to date only been associated with MERS among the diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high literacy rate of 34.4 %, which makes MSRS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses for humans of whom knowledge is available.
From mid-December to the end of 2019, conglomerated patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China, who were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also called COVID-19 disease.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross density of 3,4 %.
Notably, literacy in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while out of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dysnea.
It has also been observed daily in some patients.
Neumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high-density sequence type of 82%, they are classified in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of interest are identified.
First of all, the incubation period and the duration of the human coronavirus disease course are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are most often observed in human coronavirus infections acquired in the community, including non-specific or mild symptoms or, even, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as a result of infection by SARS-CoV, although the relationship is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting characteristics of human coronaviruses acquired in the community as well as SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to check whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human steps, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fetal samples.
If SARS-CoV-2's fecal-hour transmission plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it must still be discussed in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could show stagnation, as is the case with human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human transitions, will have an impact on the final outbreak of the disease in the course of COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses have been eliminated that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that have developed serious human coronavirus diseases.
In order to achieve this, human coronaviruses should be repatriated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that conflict with host restrictions factors.
In this sense, as more time continues to pass through SARS-CoV-2 and more infected people, it will be more likely that it will be fully adapted to humans.
If appropriate, their human transmission would be difficult to stop through the quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have been circling in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetitive people.
These viruses don't need a animal reserve.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV and the very pathogen-MERS-CoV have not been properly adapted to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to maintain and spread in their zootic reserves and seek the opportunity to promote potential human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifier guests.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics both to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and to the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible like human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and will travel between humans without a reservation or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reserve, intermediate and amplifiers of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related antistroker that shares a high level of approval of the nucleotide sequence.
The antistral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenous in this host.
In a similar way, a reservation guest is staying with a human coronavirus in a continuous and long-term way.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of human coronavirus or parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus is introduced into the middle host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenous.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and perform the role of amplifier host by allowing the virus to replay periodically and then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus may cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot support its transmission to the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also be adapted to the middle host and, even, generate long-term endemicness.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservation guest.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Further studies on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Cives of wrapped palm trees (Larvata Papuma) and a dog map in live animals markets were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were registered after killing all citizens of the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farmed palm trees without exposure to live animals markets were more negative in SARS-CoV, which suggests that they only acted as an amplifying intermediate host, but not as the natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of Guangzhou’s different animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as amplifier intermediate hostess of SARS-CoV cannot be discarded.
They all seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Further research of SARS-CoV's natural animal host revealed a closely related coronavirus called CoV HKU3 of Rhinolophus-related SARS-Rh-BatCov HKU3, which exists in Chinese hierarchical mucielages.
These musculoskeletal disorders are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequences.
This and other musculoskeletal coronavirus shares an 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have established the basis for the new concept that murals host emerging pathogens in humans.
Various coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in muciélagos, but no one, except a named WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
It is known that human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been demonstrated that the WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of musculoskeletal musculoskeletal use of the ACE2 of musculoskeletal, cives and human beings as a receptor for entering the cells.
Amazingly, patients with convalient SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, the WIV1 represents the most closely related resistance of SARS-CoV in muciélagues, which shares a 95 per cent nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homologous between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that the muciélagues are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is classified in the same group as the CV-HKU4 muciélago and the CV-HKU5 muciélago.
The CV-HKU4 and the MercS-CoV use the same host receptor, the peptidase 4 dipeptidil (DPP4), for the introduction of the virus.
Arn polymerase-dependent Arn sequences of MERS-CoV philogenetics are closer to their components of betacoronavirs of muciélagues identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, you can't find a live MERS-CoV in wild muslims.
The MercS-CoV and its closest parent, the CV-HKU25, share a sequence of nucleotide sequences of only 87 %.
Finally, the murder may not be the immediate reservation host of the MercS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East have, on the other hand, shown that drug dealers are seropositive in early neutralizers of the MERS-CoV, as well as the original Middle East camels in several African countries.
A MSS-CoV live identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the nasal exodus of dragonflies, which further supports the camels act as guests of the good reserve of the MercS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for investigations with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only by breathing, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main path of spreading viruses of the muciélagues.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have prior contact with camels prior to the occurrence of symptoms, which are reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognised animals that host the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a muciélague coronavirus, RATG13, isolated from aphinis Rhinolophus mucielagus.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to assign parental relationship.
In other words, the killers may not be the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future coronavirus of practically identical muciélagues.
It is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal guests should be among the wild species sold and killed on the largest marine market in Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenonomic sequence have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as bananas (Manis Javanica), could also accommodate betacoronavirus anti-SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pannavirus include a sequence of nucleotides of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equal to closely related to the RATG13, with an identity of about 90 % at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sub-nutrients of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more similar union domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 RBDs are more diverse, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pancreas also reported detection of viral counts in lung samples, resulting in also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of collecting and handling to generate a partial gene sequence that included around 86.3% of the complete viral genome.
We can't undo the possibility that the gangolin is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal guests.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 panel because of the sequential divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less than that between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronovirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in murciélagues, pangolins and other mammals must still be established.
Although higher sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and gangolin, betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the higher total genomology of sequence.
It is highly speculative that the high level of Similarity between the RBDs of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergence achieved through selectivity.
A counter-proposal defines a combination of betacoronavires of bananas related to SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, the combination is extended between betacoronavirus.
A conclusion has not yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from musculoskeletal coronavirus, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rats.
It was reported that a coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (colonavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a three-colour North American muciélague had a close relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another coronavirus known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of camels as intermediate guests.
For more clarity, the knowledge that has been acquired up to the time of the animal origins of human coronaviruses known is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species until it infected humans from gynaecological animals in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was registered.
Previous transmission between HCoV-229E species is not known with such precision.
Alfacoronavirus of closely related muciélagues with HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of muciélague virus to humans directly.
First of all, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with muslims in a shared ecological nest.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related haemorrhage alfacoronaviruses are different and not pathogens in the mucous membranes, while alpacas alfacoronaviruses cause respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alfacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to discard the possibility that alpacas acquire alphacoronavirus related to human HCoV-229E.
In fact, killers are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as the virus of anger, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Consequently, it would not be too surprising that the muslims transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while musculoskeletal alfacoronavirus acts as a genetic aberration of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedians could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MercS-CoV.
The MercS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from dragonflies to dragonflies, and from dragons to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MercS-CoV in the muciélagues, is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that musculoskeletals contribute, with a wide range of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, tight social interaction and the great ability to fly are all favourable conditions that turn the muciélalagas into the ideal “virus promoter”.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV has been introduced into the droids for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate guest, to being a stable and natural reservation guest.
MercS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans continue to be a terminal host of the MercS-CoV, as the transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of the MercS-CoV, the role of bananas, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the betacoronavires of pangoline are highly pathogens in the pangolins.
It is possible to be a terminal host of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, such as the bovines in the case of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 species may be transmitted to humans, confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, killers could be the reserve host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological nest with the mulciélagags, through killing or carbon mining.
Secondly, gangs could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
People commit the virus through killing and eating meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for a study of antibodies in domestic and forestry animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both the muslims and the bananas.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the boundaries of the species.
First, their exchange rates are relatively high in the RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary ARN viruses, estimated exchange rates of coronavirus may be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutes per year, per site 2, according to the adaptation phase of Coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonecle of reading testing, which has resulted in extremely high mutations and attenuation or, even, invisibility.
Curiously, it is known that the nucleotideic analogue remandifies the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exorriboneclease and the polymerase ARN dependent.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be expected that it has already been adapted to another guest near mankind.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MercS-CoV, which is well adapted to droplets.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic origin makes vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long-term RNA gene of coronaviruses performs additional plasticity in the modification of the gene for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of inter-species evolution, which contributes to the emergence of new coronavirus when appropriate conditions are made.
This is supported by the single open reading frameworks and the functions of the proteins encoded to the 3' genome.
Thirdly, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently during the replication of RNA through a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixture vehicle, the change of chain occurs frequently during the transcription of coronavirus Arn.
Arn of full and subgenomic longevity may be highly homologous in order to generate new coronaviruses.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as SL-CoV mucielago and CV-HKU9 muciélago.
HIV-Hosted interaction related to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that affects transmission between species.
The SARS-CoV combination is currently taken as a typical example, which has also shown positive selection in species transmission events.
On the basis of the comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and civilians, it is believed that SARS-CoV is experiencing rapid adaptation in different guests, in particular with changes in protein S RBD.
In general, the RBD of protein S of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the host's anti-body response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in S1 fragment, which connects to the ACE2 human and correptors for viral input.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the receptors of ACE2 from several animals, including the mucielago, the civeta, the rat and the dog map, which allows transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civilian viruses in RBD and 4 of them were found on the grounds of association with the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of civets has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the effectiveness of the interaction of spice protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in unit S1 of protein S implies that protein S compounds with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a study of electronic creomicroscopy indicates that 10 to 20 times greater than the human ECE2 and SARS-CoV protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correction might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminoopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and silic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission from species from their animal guests.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronavirus is also determined by other factors of dependency and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these human-hospital proteins and the natural reserve hosts of human coronaviruses, such as muslims, dromedians and roeers, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission of species.
Human coronaviruses should use host dependency factors and subsidize the host restriction factors in order to make the transmission between species successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-hüsped interaction should still be identified and characterised.
An objective study of the full genotype of the dependency and restriction factors of the host for SARS-CoV-2 could be provided by using advanced CRISPR technology.
The appearance of new human coronaviruses: from zero
The diversity of coronaviruses of muciélagues provides many opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, coronaviruses of muciélagues act as the genetic aerverage of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new species of protein codifiers have the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV's accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered to be important in human adaptation, since the virus of SARS-CoV-related muslims has been isolated, but it has been determined that different ORF8 proteins are codified.
There was a elimination of 29 characteristic nucleotides of SARS-CoV in isolated branches at the beginning of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive change that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible previous combinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in the ARN polymerase-dependent ARN.
Recombinations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemiological MERS-CoV suffered combination events between different lines, which took place in drummers in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses are combined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structured species.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genes, which is most likely to release the virus from the exercise of selected pressures, for example by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a complete ORF4 length in the HCoV-229E prototype, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an ORF4 infected virus of musculoskeletal viruses and cams associated with HCoV-229E could be observed, alpacas alfacoronavirus presents an insertion of a single nucleotide, which causes a change of frame.
Finally, although not least important, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the selection pressure in their reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when caronavirus muciellas were infected, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and muciellas.
The musculoskeletal disorders appear to be well adapted to the anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in muciélagues effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in muciélagues is deleted due to the positive regulation of the inhibitorial receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of Class I molecules of the greater Histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive species of oxygen (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of the musculoskeletal agents could eliminate the replication of coronavirus and affect the read-out of exorriboneclease, which contributes to the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic viruses when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by combination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a case that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservation guests, such as musculoskeletals and stones.
They respond energeticly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
In this regard, the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivity of immune response and cytokines pain, while stronger is immune response, more serious is pulmonary damage.
Instead, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of coronavirus.
The same strategy for dispersion of the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in muciélagues.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon should at least benefit from the temporary phase of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in the musculoskeletal glands is defective.
According to this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although there has been a 95 % nucleotide betacoronavirus that shares a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus that shares a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that the bovines and other animals of the markets host identical viruses to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Betacoronavirus has been found to be highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that bananas could act as one of the intermediate guests or that banana betacoronviruses could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronavirus has recovered protagonism due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in muciélagues and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the importance of zoonoses and animal reserves of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
A wide range of evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MercS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in the munitions and transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
As SARS-CoV infection originates in contact with people and civilians on the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civilians in them could have been effective in preventing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, bananas should be removed from the hot markets to prevent zoonoses transmission, taking into account the discovery of several lines of betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the pancakes and other mammals, it remains to be discussed in future research.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV has been in the droplets for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with the markets of wild animals to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent recent MERS outbreaks, an integrated approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause fractures may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, they are circling in wild condition.
In particular, coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are great possibilities for these zoonoses to evolve and combine, which would lead to the appearance of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly to humans in the future.
The culture of feeding wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From poor experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is an opportunity to make progress.
Although killers have many features that promote the spread of viruses, the opportunities for humans to contact the killers and other wild species can be minimised if they are taught to the population to avoid them.
The continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological nests of the natural reserves of zoonoses.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing several parts of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the musculoskeletals transmit an anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-virus to the pannalines, it will be interesting to analyze what circumstances the musculoskeletal and pangolins could share the same ecological nest.
Secondly, if the killers have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans enter into contact with the killers.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer acts as the real intermediate host, it must be discussed how it interacts with the different species, including humans, musculoskeletals and bananas.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
It is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continued research in this area will explore the evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of the "suppressive houses" and "confirmed houses" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which included our experience and is a good reference to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our direction and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "supplicating case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, now officially known as Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick counselling guide published online at Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He's been paying a lot of attention since he's published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.hc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our director received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our direction and also made a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support his important work and express our appreciation.
However, its work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological events with two points of clinical manifestations in order to perform an adequate analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be performed if there are no clear epidemiological events:
Epidemiological events: (1) prior to travel or residence in the city of Wuhan, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) prior contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) prior contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City and adjoining areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the appearance of symptoms; (4) prior to contact with confirmed case groups of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever, symbolism, syms, cymbols, sympathies, and sympathies in the city of Wuhan, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the appearance of symptoms; (4) prior to contact with confirmed cases of cases.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of infection by COVID-19; (3) total white blood cells containing normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte content at the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some pathogenic or serologic test characteristics as follows: (1) test of reaction chain polymerase in real-time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) follow-up of the complete viral gene showing high homogeneity to the new recognized coronaviruses; (3) positive result for the specific IgM and the specific IgG body against SARS-CoV-2 in a soil test; or a change of the specific IgG body against SARS-CoV-2 positive positive, or an increase of Title ≥4 times in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase response test to detect nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory pathways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serologic tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is more evidence that reminds us that we should be careful with asymptomatic and atypical symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al. flow diagrams should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be checked in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will arise and ask the readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspecting case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and implementing the latest guidelines from their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines in an timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
To date, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Investigation (IEDCR) reported that the number of cases registered infected included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were being found in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
At an online briefing, IEDCR Director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the missing was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was serving at the Kuwait Maite Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video release online, the Minister for Transport by Street and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for more time than expected initially, until this very next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had begun on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first cases recorded by COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men who returned from Italy and also one of them were women.
By March 19, these three had already been recovered.
More than one million infections by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The tsunami took place the same day that Malawi confirmed its first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had its first death related to coronavirus.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronary infections.
On yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-fourth hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, associated with at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that the mercols had more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Throughout the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of disease.
The Thursday, Sergei Sobayinin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's castle until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to earn their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and a vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the remaining tolls in the holy cities La Meca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the remaining toll remained only between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand planned to implement a drop rate between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the thresholds for trade-related hygienic paper
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase thresholds for two and a transaction package in all the country's supermarkets, respectively.
The moon, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were, according to the report, being provided for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-assess themselves.
The Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of hygienic paper to give home to a package by request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Cole, in his press release on 8 March, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets even cover the product within an hour of delivery", and said that the demand "did not have priors", while ALDI, in a publication on Facebook on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
The sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a voice from Woolworths.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To ease the gap further, Cole asked for larger packages to suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made provision for a special supply of planned thousands.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retalers Association, said that minorities are trying to increase the existence, but the restrictions on the time of delivery are difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet the demand, and less offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offers of mercury.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert at the University of Queensland Technology, said that supermarkets provide the existences all night long.
He pointed out that the hygienic role is an extensive article, which causes a low number of existences in numbers, and when it is filled, it leaves a wide space empty in the stars, which intensifys the sense of loss.
Cole and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there were a lot of the article in the stars, if products such as hygienic and disinfectant roles could [compared] and have large quantities, it would probably minimize panic, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The recyclable hygienic paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap told the past miracles that consumed the existences.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Klenex, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, noted that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the news.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered the first bidder free of charge to the first bidder in Melbourne, when they were less subsidised because the buyers had time to end the long weekend of the Workers' Day.
The edition of the NT News youth journal, published in Darwin, included an eight-page paper designed to cut and use as a hygienic paper.
Supermarkets in the beginning showed resistance to restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, in which they said they did not have plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demands, among them, mascarillas, disinfectant, dry products, liquid japanese and resin.
Similarly, outside Australia, Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Octado limited the purchases of the Andres hygienic paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
The Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to motivate Governments to take measures:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, trace, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said.
We are very concerned, both at alarming levels of spread and severity, and at alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Control Centres and Prevention of Diseases in the United States, the pandemic “has no priors”.
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "In addition to influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the appearance to the continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying, "Never before have we seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic conditions arise after WHO's decision in January to declare the crime a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the National Institute of Allergys and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the crime, "in conclusion, it's going to improve".
Up to Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 is a disease-related pandemic by Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Public health emergency was declared internationally important on 30 January 2020 and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths were reported as a result.
About 364,000 people were recovered.
It was estimated that the rate of literacy per case was 4% in China, while, at global level, it was estimated to be between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
Frequent symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
The complications may include neumonia and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to four days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic therapy and support. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth with the toser, keeping away from other people and controlling and self-restraining people who are suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, forty-five, restocks, risk controls at the workplace and closures of facilities.
The pandemic has led to a serious global socio-economic change, the succession or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread lack of supplies consumed by the purchases motivated by panic.
Schools and universities closed to national or local levels in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4% of the world's student population.
Wrong information about the virus was spread over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South Asian descent, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction of heavy-duty travel and closures, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) informed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and an investigation began early in January 2020.
The cases, in most of them, were related to Huanan's largest maritime market, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to the coronaviruses of the muciélagues, the coronaviruses of the bananas and the SARS-CoV. Later, it was discovered that the first person who was suspected of symptoms was sick on December 1, 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the last group of the market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were determined to have a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that, on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to the reports, decreased in China but recently increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had first exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported in young people, and those 19-year-olds represented 2.4 per cent of the cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, believed that 60 per cent of the British population would have to be infected before an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who were tested by COVID-19 and who obtained a positive result confirmed under official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had performed more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to perform tests in people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79 per cent of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 will be recovered.
For those who do not, the time spent from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most common 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of the deaths were compared to people over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to missing persons who gave positive results in the COVID trial, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the number of actual deaths due to the COVID-19 is much higher, since it may not be included in those who have failed without testing, for example in their homes, in the homes of elders, etc.
Part of Italy's data revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A voice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States admitted: "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is a sub-assessment", a statement sponsored by the anecdotal subcontinent reports in the United States. This sub-assessment is common in pandemics, such as the 2009 influenza pandemic H1N1. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death out of continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death out of Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, out of continental China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except Antarctica. In general, several indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to the region and with time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time passed from the initial crime and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given period of time.
According to the University of Johns Hopkins statistics, the worldwide proportion of deaths on cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) by 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the rate of mortality per case, reflecting the percentage of persons diagnosed who failed because of a disease, and the rate of mortality by infections, reflecting the percentage of patients (diagnostics and non-diagnosed) who failed because of a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and consider a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the incidence rate for pandemic infections in its entirety is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the rate of lettality by case.
WHO claims that pandemics can be controlled.
The peak and the final duration of the brake are inverted and can vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectious diseases, if they do not control, are generally stabilized and then started to decrease when the disease becomes available without guests.
But, at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast of when that will happen."
Chief medical adviser to the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "may end in June" if it can be mobilized to all countries in order to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the University of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine of London, said that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain on the move, possibly for one or two years".
According to the study of the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until there is a vaccine (probably 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it is transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "may become a local disease, which occurs all year round."
The virility of recovery would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry (68%).
The most common symptoms include fatigue, rash production in respiratory tract (flame), loss of sense of the olfato, lack of air, muscle pain and articular pain, headache, headaches, vomiting, hemopathism, diarrhoea or cianosis. WHO claims that approximately one of the six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in awakening and blueden in the face or lips; immediate medical attention may be recommended before these symptoms occur.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, do not present clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore, researchers advised to control and carefully examine those who have a close contact with infected persons in order to dispose of the infection.
China's estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people are slightly less than 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more often it is from 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of olfat at baseline was 30% and then decreased by 15%.
Some details of how disease spreads are still being identified.
It is believed that the disease is spread mainly during the close contact and through the small holes that occur in the tosser, shock or talk; the close contact is considered to be a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, the rubber can be moved from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet) without covering the mouth.
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. respiratory drops can also be produced during the exhalation, even when speaking, although generally the virus is not transmitted by air.
The gouts can enter the mouth or nose of the people who are nearby or possibly inhale to the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary re-animation (RCP), may cause the aerosolisation of respiratory secretions and therefore air-producing.
You can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that you can pass through the holes, it is believed that this risk is low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although it may be possible to spread before symptoms and at more advanced stages of disease occur.
People received positive results in the disease tests up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible prior to developing significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, in general, one person is infected with two or three others.
In particular, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in tests of COVID-19 performed in males and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to human beings, although the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that might have affected infected persons.
Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which first isolated three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Apart from the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with jabone, which dissipates its protective environment. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genotype betacoronavirus, its subgeneral sarbecovirus (line B) together with two stems derived from the muciélago.
At the level of the complete genome, 96 % is identical to other mollusc coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the gene sequences between the fungal viruses and those of human beings.
Up to that date, the comparison of the complete gene showed that the coronavirus of the bananas and SARS-CoV-2 share, as a maximum, 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the bananas are the intermediate host.
The virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, in the last instance, it is confirmed by the response in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized Tomography images.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan in which polymerase chain reaction was compared to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain chain response, though less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and neurons.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first line test for diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed in blood samples or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within hours or days.
In general, this test is carried out with a nasopharyngeal sympathy, although it can also be used as a serologic test. Some laboratories and companies are developing serologic tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be sufficiently precise as to approve their generalised use.
In the United States, a serologic test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories alone.
The characteristic features in the images of computerized radiographs and tomography (TC) of sympathetic people include opacities in a glass delusated asymmetric peripherals and missing pleural wastes.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an international database on the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to the superposition with other infections such as adenavirus, the diagnosis of unconfirmed images through a polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A broad study conducted in China compared the results of computerized toorax tomography with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the diagnosis by images is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convulsive neuronal networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in the images, both with radiographics and computerized tomography.
The strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining a good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, nose or mouth with hands without washing them before, and pulling or touching on a dissociating garment and touching the garment directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
It is also recommended that physical distance measures be taken to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or unconstitutional travel from and to countries and areas affected by the crime.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how it has been infected. It is recommended that medical care providers who attack someone who may be infected take the standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. The trace of contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent more transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments with this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to require limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on private solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the presence of a user on other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who said positive in the COVID-19 test. They are circling mistaken ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and oral injection garages are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have their hands clearly swabs; before eating and after singing the nose, towels or towels.
This is due to the fact that, outside of the human body, the virus dies when it comes in contact with a jabon, which decomposes its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based disinfectant with at least 60 % of alcohol in volume when no water and soap are available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces may be decontaminate with several solutions (in one minute after exposure to the disinfectant in an oxidative steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 % and iodine iodine at 0.2–7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloride gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or guard, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic helmets that have been used by sick people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with the flexible code or with a dissipable thumb to touch or toss, and that they remove it immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, since the use of a male can limit the volume and distance of the respiratory gates that divide by speech, noise and toss.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Useing a male can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without an adequate hand hygiene."
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they run a high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of men by the public.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of non-medicines made with tea. China specifically recommended the use of detached medical masks by the healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or to be in competitive places.
Thailand's health officials recommend that people make tea parlors in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited access to public spaces without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask in public spaces to protect and protect others.
The Government of Austria requested the use of men by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use men in public.
Taiwan, which has produced tens of millions of Mascarillas per day since mid-March, requested the use of Mascarillas by train and interurban buses on April 1.
Panama imposed compulsory use of spare parts for free air, while also recommending the manufacture of domestically made macarillas to those who cannot buy them.
The mascarillas have also been used in general in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to prevent the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and commercial centres.
People can implement social distance methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding competitive areas, using healthy forms that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many governments now require or recommend social distance in areas affected by the crime.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there were no COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and later 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two persons. Adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and committed immune systems are more likely to suffer from serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommends that they remain in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to make clear that the objective is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections is virtually or virtual.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt a full social isolation rather than encourage them to remain in contact with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
It includes recommendations that only have sexual relations with a person who lives with, that does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-relief was recommended in the home of those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on adequate self-restraint; many governments have requested or recommended self-care for entire populations in the affected areas.
The strictest self-care instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
To those who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with generalised transmission, self-care is recommended for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies to control a crime are containment or suppression and mitigation.
In addition to introducing other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of disease to the rest of the population, it is intended to identify and isolate infected persons.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigating phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigating measures can be adopted at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to enable the pandemic to be recovered by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of the control of the outbreak of an infectious disease involves attempting to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as planning the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health services and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the crime include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-care; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of massive competition events; Community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental and surface cleaning measures. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the crime once it became evident that it resulted, for example, in the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has implemented mass detection assessments and localized forty-four, and has issued warnings about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to do so and forced large numbers of people who did not.
Taiwan has increased male production and has condemned the accumulation of medical supplies. The simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigating (which reduces the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two thirds and deaths in the middle, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
The elimination may be preferred, but it should be maintained for all time that the virus is circling in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if that happens first), as the transmission is reactivated rapidly when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to remove pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, which includes testing of existing drugs.
Taking medicines free of charge for the meals, drinking liquids, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
According to severity, oxygenotherapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids can improve results.
Several components that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional homes" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of medical attention to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have provided guidance to primary medical care hospitals and services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures where possible, separate and isolate positive patients in COVID-19 and increasing the capacity of intensive care through staff training and the increase in the number of breathers and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the called zero patient).
The first case known as the new Coronavirus can be resumed on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the largest marine market in Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a series of cases of unknown cause neumonia were observed by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Jianghan's CDC on December 27.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police threatened eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was arrested by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
At the beginning of January, sufficient cases of causation were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan as to initiate an investigation. During the first stages of the crime, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was spread to other Chinese provinces, which contributed to migration by the New China Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and an important railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data show that, on 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy with the largest number of cases confirmed worldwide. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have failed and more than 364,000 have been recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted their free movement and established border controls.
National responses have included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as housekeeping orders, shelter orders or restrictions) and landings. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, meet some type of detention in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined to South Africa, and 1300 million people are confined to India.
On 26 March, 1700 million people around the world met some kind of restriction, which increased to 2600 million people two days later, around the third part of the world population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 is referred to as 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case took place on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and his hospital informed Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
The WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan about "distributing rumors" about the crime.
The National Health Commission of China at the outset stated that there had not been " clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a dramatic campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarter in the history of humanity", on 23 January a health code was announced prohibiting travel inside and outside Wuhan, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected about 57 million people in total.
Special vehicles were prohibited in the city.
New Chinese Year (January 25th) celebrations were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoschenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conventions and stadiums, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 bridge, which included the issue of health declarations for travelers and the extension of the Spring Festival wound.
The universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have implemented a number of measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures have been established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
The control of the public movement was implemented in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some sort of restriction on the release of air. Following the beginning of the global phase of the crime in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “importation” of the virus in other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quota for all international travelers entering the city. On 23 March, only a case had been transmitted at national level in China in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a passenger who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, China's first minister, Li Keqiang, reported that the dissemination of cases transmitted at national level was basically blocked and that the crime had been controlled in China.
On the same day, the travel restrictions were flexible in Hubei and Wuhan two months after the restriction was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visas or residence permits from 28 March would be suspended without specific details of when this policy would be finalised.
Those who want to enter China should request visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China urged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic incentives for firms. The Council of State declared a day of struggle that would begin with a three-minute national silence on April 4th at 10:00, in line with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to show their respect online for the physical distance in order to avoid the COVID-19 withdrawal.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 was promoted from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health body reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesús Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the crime.
On 22 February, of the 9336 followers of the church, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korea military bases remained in forty after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The hours of the airlines were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the most widely organized and well-organized program in the world to test the virus detection in the population and isolate infected people, as well as identifying and putting in contact with those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included the mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by persons recently arrived from other countries through a mobile application, drive-three centres to perform virus detection tests with results available on the following day, and increased diagnostic capacity to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the bridge despite not adopting the quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society at first was polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to require Moon's expulsion, which they considered to be an ill-treatment of the crime by the Government, or well, to commend their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in one day less than four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all newly arrived outside must remain in custody for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance for the testing of the 121-country virus.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of infections by SARS-CoV-2 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people were missing later that day.
The early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has designated five billion reals to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to place the areas affected by the crime, and that it would only be placed in the care of the people.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although the heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian New Year continued.
The church shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a center of spread of the virus after China.
Among the allegations of a coverage of the magnitude of the crime in Iran, more than ten countries had reported their cases in Iran for 28 February, which indicated that the magnitude of the crime could be more serious than 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government to that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported that they had obtained positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to release the defenders of human rights detained by peaceful discretion, and also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a greater risk of spreading virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical attention.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest number registered in the country since the beginning of the crime.
By 17 March, at least 12 explosives or politicians in Iran's exercise had failed by the disease.
On 23 March, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every 10 minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO staff member, Iran may have five times as many cases as are reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the criminal offence.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relief of economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the bridge was confirmed in Italy, when two Chinese tourists gave positive results in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
The cases began to increase rapidly, which led the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and to declare the state of emergency.
Later, a group of non-relevant cases of COVID-19 were detected, which started with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the crime, which included placing more than 50,000 people in custody of 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
First Minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, "It will not be allowed to enter or out of the areas affected by the crime.
The suspension of work activities and sports events in these areas has already been ordered."On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.

On 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery in Italy, most of which occurred in the region of Lombardia.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy of a large population of advanced age and the inability to test all people with the virus up to date could contribute to the high level of flexibility.
The United Kingdom's response to the first virus emerged as one of the most vulnerable countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any type of social distance or massive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism from the apparent lack of speed and intensity in response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that he had neglected social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people would work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure of all eight institutions, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of workers' wages to a limit of 2500 GBP per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the first Minister announced measures of stricter social distance, which prohibited meetings of more than two persons and restricted the travel and activities of those who were considered strictly necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could require compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of many meetings and the dissemination of meetings.
The closure of most companies was ordered, except those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmaceuticals, banks, railways, gas and workshops.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the control and maintenance of the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when accused of secretism by the Chinese authorities that prevented the efforts to prevent and contain, and the current crisis in which the Central Government “has provided periodic updates to prevent panic in the New Lunar wound”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gaden Galea pointed out that, although "expectedly not a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it did not have priors in the history of public health". On 30 January, following the confirmation of the transmission of human beings out of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance (SPI), the sixth EPII since the first time the measure was invoked during the 2009 flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the ESPII was "the risk of global proliferation, especially for low and medium-income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tetros stated that "there are no grounds for taking measures that are unnecessary to interfere with international trade and travel" and that "OMS does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, and cited the urgency to support those countries "who do not have systems to detect persons who contravenes the virus, if any."
Tetros also made statements in which he stated that "we are just as strong as our weakest sword" and urged the international community to "invert today or pay more in the future." On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to bring “power of the entire United Nations system in response”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was launched, which allowed coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, would allow them to " focus on the health response while other agencies could bring their expertise to address the wider social, economic and development consequences of the crime".
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was launched to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist national management and assess "the severity and communicableness of disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with key national institutions and to make visits to the site to assess "impact of response activities at provincial and county level, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus", and noted that, although it was still very early to make it a pandemic, the countries still had to be "in a stage of preparation".
In response to a developmental outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global threat assessment of coronavirus would be "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of the reality for all governments of the planet: they open.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared," stressing that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and he pointed out that this statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On 11 March, WHO declared Pandemia the coronavirus outbreak.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned about both alarming levels of spread and severity, and alarming levels of inaction". WHO has received important criticisms because it is considered an inadequate pandemic management, including the late public health declaration and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 persons on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized the respect for the rights of all persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone had the right to interventions that saved lives and that the Government had this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts pointed out that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, persons detained, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups that need government support.
Intergovernmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impact of the crisis by the COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide full and timely information on policy responses across the world, in addition to views and advice.
From policies to strengthen global health and economic systems to address the effects of restriction and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-wide policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenges of coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, by his leadership in the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were challenged because of their efforts to care for the Quartet in central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to the crime in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, expressed a pre-recognition of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, in favour of conspiracy theories on the origin of COVID-19 in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", and it stated that the "China censorship has superseded a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which, in turn, has been marked by some critics such as racism and "distracing" of the failure of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government telegram that described a strategy of communication with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and called the strategy "All About China".
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Communications such as Politicians, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's external policy representative, Joseph Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and gender policy".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to raise its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent assistance to these two last countries.
On 3 April, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 men to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of issuing assistance to other countries in their own country.
There have been reports of disputes relating to male genital mutilation among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has introduced hundreds of spiritists for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, affected by coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, an Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed that the Russian army sends military doctors, special disinfectants and other medical teams to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level policy force" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or useless for Italy".
The source accused Russia of committing an offence of "geopolitic and diplomatic seduction".
The president of Lombardia, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the periodic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "when offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when US manufacturers of materials and medical equipment cover impulse, they can also correspond if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercise "defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticised the year 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it threatens not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries participating, but also the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government has been greatly affected by the virus, with about two hundred members of the infected Parliament, as well as five other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, saying that his country is having difficulties in combating the crime due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The crime prompted the requirement that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family license and higher levels of funds for public health.
Political analysts predicted that it might negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the presidential election of 2020. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea had improved due to pandemics.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive efforts" after Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea would remain in quarter for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
South Korea's society was initially polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed requests to require Moon's expulsion for which they considered a wrongful treatment of the crime by the Government, or rather to commend their response, and the pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that governments could strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree in an indefinable manner, suspend Parliament and the elections and punish those who are considered to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
Coronavirus was responsible for several cases of lack of supplies, as a result of the largest use of equipment worldwide to combat the outbreaks, panic-induced purchases and interruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has published warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to the greatest demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several sites also presented panic-induced purchases that left the standing vacuumes of essential products, such as food, hygiene paper and drinking water, which caused the lack of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic products shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This claim generated an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in four to six months of delays in the supply of medical products.
It also caused a lack of personnel protection teams worldwide, and WHO warned that this would pose a threat to health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a lack of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently prohibited by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by the lack of food.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful and have avoided a deep shortage of food that has been foreseen in Europe and North America.
The North of Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to sector representatives.
Food stores were only temporary, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released raw meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a periodic report of 16 March, China's economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and the retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
Since continental China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a major threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences arises.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on world supply chains that could last for up to two years.
It is reported that the Petroleum Exporting Organization (OPEC) remained "resurrected" after a strong fall in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, world values markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside of continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. bosatile indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced losses since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indexes ended the week with less than 10 %.
On 28 February, Skopje Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit qualification, but maintained a negative perspective.
Action was resumed on the basis of the fears of the Coronavirus, the biggest crash occurred on 16 March.
Many consider it likely that there is an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they responded to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel to any part of the world.
As a result, many airlines have canceled flights due to the lowest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Kantas, while British Regional Airport Flybe crashed.
The impact on cross-border enterprises has never reached a level before.
Several railway stations and terminals of shippers have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important period of travel related to New China's wounded.
Several events involving large audiences were canceled by national and regional governments, including New Year's Festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's tourist events and attractions have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including Pekin City and the traditional festivals of the temples.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's wound until 10 February, and ordered that most of the jobs not be reopened until that date.
These regions represent 80 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of country exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the highest infectious disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled their New Year's celebrations. The minority sector was affected at world level, with cuts in the hours of attention or temporary closures.
Minority visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
The minorities in North America and the Middle East experienced a drop of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a 33 to 43% drop in the oil transit to commercial centres in March compared to February.
Operators from commercial centres around the world have launched additional measures, such as major hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control buyers' temperature and cancellation of events. According to a estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America who had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million migrant rural workers in China were displaced in their homes in the provinces of the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million people in the United States lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Luis. The restriction in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to Angus Reid Institute, 44 per cent of Canadian households experienced some type of unemployment. About 900 000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the restriction began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers requested temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers requested a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidised by the Government, known as Kurzworking, for their employees.
The German short-term working compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
Sceneic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, around the world.
The organizations of the culture and art sector tried to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public and to support artists when possible.
For March 2020, museums, libraries, places of exhibitions and other cultural institutions have been permanently closed, and their exhibitions, events and exhibitions have been cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence, which increases a accelerated rate of disease, is the cancellation of religious services. Important sports events and other social events, such as music and concerts, technology conferences and fashion exhibitions.
The cinematographic industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian prison period of the Quaresma.
Many dioceses have recommended that adult Christians stay in their homes instead of attending church on Sundays; some churches have offered religious services through radio, live broadcasts on the Internet or television, while others offer space to pray from the car.
After the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome decided to close its churches and chapels and with the Plaza of St. Peter empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, churches and temples.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of the monies of the Fridays in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreigners and their residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or posted, among them, the UEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the First League 2019-20, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The bridge interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "be reprogrammed for a later date by 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gambling sites around the world closed and online poker tournaments were placed or canceled.
This has led many depositors to access the Internet, many online sites have reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, several musical groups have suspended or cancelled concerts.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway's, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work via the Internet as an alternative to the show in traditional life, such as live live performances of concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet so that artists can interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, a number of Internet memes were distributed on the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and Oriental Asian descent, and to people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia and the Pacific.
February reports (when most cases were still limited in China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world expressing that the Chinese were worthy of the virus or that they were receiving what they considered to be a fair repression.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside.
After the outbreak of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed applications to prevent Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan was a trend in Twitter.
Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insult, as well as aggression.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Manifests in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who shared a border with China, and studied in the main Indian cities, suffered acute coronavirus outbreaks.
The president of the state unity of the Bharatiya Janata party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God came from them."
The Chinese consular in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "errorists". In China, xenophobic and racism increased to non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and it was described to foreigners as "foreign basis" and intended for "disease".
Many periodicals with payment walls removed them for parts or the entire coverage of coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the bridge available with open access.
Some scientists have opted to quickly share their results with pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory tests for the respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase, which detects the Aaron of Coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the ARN of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population monitoring.
Ancient evidence shows how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too early to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate can be determined from the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population.
Due to the limited evidence, by March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had performed more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant variations in the number of tests carried out in the different countries.
It is also likely that this variable is significantly affecting the literacy rates by informed cases, which are likely to be very high in some countries.
Through the reaction chain of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hesopharyngitis or rash samples.
The results are generally available within hours up to 2 days.
The test of reaction in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase carried out with hemorrhages is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In persons infected with the second week test, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory pathways by means of a suction catheter, or the material released from the toser (exposure).
One of the first polymerase chain reactions was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain response with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, South Korea's Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the reaction chain of clinical degree polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the approval of the emergency use of the National Administration of Medical Products of China of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on a polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) are distributing their diagnostic panel of response in the chain of polymerase with inverse inverse inverse in-time reverse for the new Coronavirus 2019 (19-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reaganant Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the previous versions of test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reactions, and an attack on CDC testing in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests used by two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only since then were the State and local laboratories allowed to perform tests.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at national level of COVID-19 tests based on the response in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, this Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at national level.
No limit was made to the quantity; collection of specifications and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Attention Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests during a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorisations for Abbott Laboratories for a test in the system m2000 of Abbott; FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hholic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cephet received the FDA emergency authorisation for a test that lasts about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isothermal amplification technology of nuclear acids instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of different temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott are planning to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a monoclonal test is being developed using a monoclonal body that is specifically attached to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as fast as an influence test.
In March 2020, the publication review concluded that "Torax radiographs have little diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computed tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms appear".
The typical features in the TC include bilateral multilobar opacities in a glass delucated with a peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination is developed, a pattern of impeding and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the reaction in the polymerase chain was compared with computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction in the polymerase chain, though less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first line test for diagnosis of COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDC has recommended the reaction in the polymerase chain as an initial review.
Part of the reaction of the immune system to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine the immunity and monitoring of the population. Analysis can be carried out in central laboratories or through tests on attention.
The automated high performance systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood species is generally used, although serious species can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single blood sample is usually obtained by a skin puncture.
Unlike the polymerase chain response methods, there is no need for an extraction step before the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that notified the agency as appropriate and can therefore now distribute its anti-body tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is of several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional test of response in the string of the viral RNA polymerase.
The antibodies can generally be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom found that none of the test kits he bought were as good as to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspect patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for specimen", the patient skips in the tube, sends it and receives a short-term result. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyse suspected cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient is infected if he goes to the hospital or needs to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the trials in driving-through centres for COVID-19 suspects, a health professional takes samples with appropriate precautions.
The driving-through centres have helped South Korea make some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Healthy Doctors of Statutory Health said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the hospital environment and that 10 700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance takes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a general capacity to perform 160 000 tests per week.
On 19 March, tests were made through the drive-through system in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, on the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were analysed, including the week of 12/20, and 33,491 samples (6.9 %) were positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Institute of Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyse samples of 64 patients simultaneously, consisting of grouping samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample was positive. On 5 February 2020, BGI launched an emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" in 2000 square meters.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the cost of dealing with the quarantine had been doubled without this capacity for the trial.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjün, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 trials per day. Multiplexed open-source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow an evaluation of up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid manipulation robots.
In March, the lack and insufficient amounts of assets affected massive evidence in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore samples preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now conducting more human coronavirus detection tests in its population than any other country, and was directed to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the level of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of tests of response in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Various test formulas have been developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for producing kits sent to low-income countries that did not have resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases was not available until 28 January, which reduced the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the proof kits at the outset of the crime, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the great availability of South Korea's evidence has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its ability to carry out tests, especially in private sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays in hundreds of thousands of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of hesopathic and chemical agents were increased.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented the carrying out of the private test. Spain purchased test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained unexpected results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to the wrong collection of samples or the wrong use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would withdraw the kits that had stolen the wrong results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China had received incorrect results.
First Minister Matovic suggested that they were shot at Danubio. Atesh Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought in China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not.
The implementation of tests, complemented by a quarter of those who obtained positive results and the identification of persons who had been contacted who gave positive results in SARS-CoV-2, provided satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, performed two rounds of tests throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Nearly half of those who obtained positive results did not have symptoms, and all cases detected were put in custody.
With restrictions on travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, the restrictions on travel from the outside, testing and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has advanced much faster than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and minority establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to recommend to residents staying in their homes on 28 March, but schools were reopened shortly after the wound on 23 March.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from outside, testing and quarantine, but with less strict restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more tests, with regard to the number of deaths, have much lower literacy rates, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who do not have symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that are unable to carry out tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Possitive as % of evidence" is influenced by the country's country's test policy.
A country that only carries out tests in people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive as % of the evidence that a country carrying out tests in all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action to wash hands with a view to eliminating suction, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The washing of hands with japanese constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucus membranes).
The five critical moments during the day during which it is important to wash hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child’s neck or changing clothes, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or sheep meat.
If there is no water or japanese, hands can be cleaned with censorship. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing clothes or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose is sounded, tossed or starved.
After touching animals, food for animals or wastes.
Medical hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical attention may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause a disease) and chemicals that may cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the rate of infant mortality in children at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand washing practices can result in small improvements in growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheic diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate by almost 50% for these diseases.
Interventions that promote hand washing may reduce diarrhoea episodes in a third party, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrhoea episodes can be related to the washing of hands with japanese. The washing of hands with japanese is the most effective and economic way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour in homes, schools and communities around the world.
The neumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year are covered.
Diarrhea and pneumonia combined represent nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing into japanese before eating and after using the bath in a dried habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half the deaths per day and to a quarter of the deaths by acute respiratory infections.
In general, hand washing is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against infection, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance may cause skin damage due to skin resuscitation.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a cutanous infection that causes picazone and makes the skin become famous as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in health workers.
The washing of hands too often is also considered one of the symptoms of the complex obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when the washing of hands with japanese is important to reduce the oral-female transmission of the diseases: after using the bath (orar, defecated), after cleaning a child’s neck (changeboards), before feeding a child, before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or sheep meat.
Other occasions in which proper hand washing techniques should be used to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after removing, touching or swallowing the nose; after touching wastes of animals or handling animals; and after touching dust.
In many countries, there is a low wash rate of hands with apples.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families had hand washing with jaboon. A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had a higher rate of 97%; the United States was about half of 77%; and China had the lowest rate of 23%. Currently, there are several methods for changing behaviors, to increase the use of hands washing with japanese at critical times. The washing of hands in a group of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing in children's behavior.
The essential health care programme implemented by the Philippines Department of Education is an example of action to promote the health and education of children.
Disappear twice a year, in addition to washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is the basis of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of skin microorganisms improves by adding jabond or detachable water.
The main action of the jabones and founders is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The only water is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
The solid apple, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid apple bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, since bacteria are mixed with foam.
Even so, CDCs claim that "the liquid apple is preferable with disposal controls that do not involve the use of the hands".
Antibacterial jabonies have been actively promoted for a conscious public of health.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics are used to maintain antibodies resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial jabonies contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, who have an extensive list of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial jabonies do not preserve the resistance to antibiotics, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surface agent and which protects the skin, sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, assorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more conditions for skin (green oil, vitamins, manganese, vegetable extracts). An extensive analysis of the Public Health School of the University of Oregon indicated that common jabons are as effective as the antibacterial jabons for the consumer that contain triclosans to prevent disease and eliminate the bacteria of the hands.
The warm water to wash hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, Japan’s waters are more effective than the Japanese cold water to eliminate natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using tibia water has no effect on reducing the microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a waterless agent for the hygiene of hands.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the twenty-first century, hygiene agents with no water and alcohol to fertilize (also known as an alcohol-based solution to fertilize, antiseptic solution to fertilize or disinfectants into hands) began to acquire popularity.
The majority is based on isopropylic alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thicker carbon agent (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moistureant like glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol retention.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide also increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 and 95% of alcohol at least remove germs effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to break away bacteria, bacteria resistant to various medicines (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, renovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and honey.
Alcohol-based disinfectants that contain 70 % of alcohol remove 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logirats, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (reducing 4-5 logirats) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contaminated gastroenteritis. A sufficient solution for antiseptic hands or alcohol-based drugs should be used to freeze or completely cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and the outers of all fingers, are frozen for about 30 seconds until the liquid, the foam or the gel are dried.
The fingers should also be washed well, washing them in both palms. The U.S. Control Centres and Disease Prevention Centres recommend washing hands before washing hands for washing, especially when hands are obviously dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on their ease of use and the rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, it should not be used as a substitute for adequate washing of hands unless no water or jaboon is available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based disinfectants may be obtained by the skin unless emulsifiers or hydraters are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol sequentiality can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing emulsifiers caused a significantly lower irritability and shortness of skin than antimicrobial jabones or detectors.
Allergic dermatitis by contact, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitive or the additives present in alcohol-based solutions are very rare.
The smaller tendency to cause irritant dermatitis by contact was attractive compared to wash of hands with water and jaboon.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water agents do not remove the organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and japanese to prevent the spread of many pathogens as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic disinfectants depends largely on the ingredients and the formula, in addition to historically, has been much less than alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to feed.
More recently, formulae using benzalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy japanese and use censorship or land.
Cenics or land may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than apples.
One concern is that, if soil or censors are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of diseases instead of reducing them.
Like apples, censorship is also a disinfectant agent, as, in contact with water, forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using censium or arena as an alternative to apples when there is no apple.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States to prevent the transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with running water tea or cold.
It is recommended that the current water is used because the containers with frozen water may be contaminated, while the water temperature appears to be no different.
Wash your hands to form foam with a generous amount of japanese, including the hair of your hands, between your fingers and below your cheeks.
The apple removes skin germs, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more carefully when they use apples than when they use water alone.
Restrict for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps eliminate skin germs, and restricting for longer periods removes more germs.
Swimming well with running water.
Injugating in a container can also pollute your hands again.
Eat with a clean towel or let go of air.
The soft hands and soft hands are once again contaminated with more easily. The most frequently forgotten parts are the pellets, the mussels, the areas between the fingers and below the nails.
Artificial grapes and dried grapes may include micro-organisms.
Often, it is recommended to prevent the hand from shaking; dry skin may cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when there is no current water or tapion, for example, to draw water from a bonded pool or cable with suitable sources or to use censorship if needed in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "houses" and other economic options.
A home flu is a simple technology consisting of using a suspended wall of a soga and a foot-and-mouthed palace to see a small amount of water over the hands and a bar bar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hygiene process, but there is some debate on the most effective drying in public baths.
More and more are the research that indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study sponsored by the association of the European Tissue Symposium Paper Tolls Industry to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper Towels, Hot Air dryers and more modern air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased, on average, by 194 per cent in the fingers and 254 per cent in the palms.
The result was an average increase in the total number of bacteria from 42 per cent in the teeth and 15 per cent in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the teeth and 77% in the palms. Scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was a risk of cross-contamination of other users of the bathroom and the bathroom as a result of each type of drying method.
The air heater, which airs from the unit at speeds, is said to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to sleep with the micro-organisms of the hands and the unit and, potentially, contamination to other users of the bathroom and the bathroom area up to 2 metres away.
The use of a hot air hands dryer spreads micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in the bacterium count after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant towels for hands is an alternative during travel, when there is no water or jaboon.
The alcohol-based disinfectant must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The washing of the hands of doctors became very mandatory after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind members of hospital staff who wash their hands when they forget.
One study tested a reduction in the rates of infection with its use.
The washing of the hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and japanese or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be restricted together by interlinking the fingers.
If there are residues below the grapes, a cherries can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to warm them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being contaminated again by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("hermogenes") and to prevent transmission of them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the shortage of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of infection of the blood stream related to catheter in 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a guide in demonstrating the washing of hands and washing of standard hands in medical care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's manual for manual hygiene can also be found on its website so that the public can make comments.
Whitby and others have carried out a relevant review.
Trade devices can measure and verify the hygiene of their hands, if necessary.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before asymptic work and
After treatment with patients, the aggregate of antiseptic chemicals in the apple (a "medical" or "antibacterial" jabones) entrusts you with the possibility of elimination to the washing agent.
This elimination may be necessary before a surgery or in surroundings where the resistant organisms are very common to antibiotics. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to count with a flu that can be opened and closed without touching with the hands, a little chlorohexin or yodo for washing, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterilized skin to cool and another sterile instrument to clean up under the walls.
All toys should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and feet up to the code for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When injecting, it must be avoided that the water of the antebrates returns to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized bread and place a surgical battle.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after treating sick people.
In order to control the infections caused by staphylococcal in hospitals, it has been verified that the maximum benefit of hand clearance is in the first 20% of the washing and that it is very little to gain additional benefit when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
The washing with common apple results in more than one third of the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to foods compared to the washing with antibacterial soap. When comparing the washing of hands with an alcohol based solution with a washing of hands with an antibacterial apple for an average period of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the frotate with alcohol reduced the contamination of bacteria more than the antibacterial apple.
However, water and japanese are more effective to reduce influenza A H1N1 and Clostridium strains of the hands that are difficult to wash hands with alcohol. The interventions to improve the hygiene of hands in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of disinfectants on the basis of alcohol and written and oral reminders.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, the washing of hands with apples is considered to be an economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, japanese or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal washing habits.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few flues to wash hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of dried habits and not the lack of japanese or water.
Promoting hand washing with japanese can influence political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause a long-term change in the behaviour of the population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to follow up and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that Community approaches are effective to increase hand washing in the PRBM, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's three-star approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can pass from one a, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations may be part of the hand washing promotion campaigns that are being carried forward to reduce the disease and infant mortality.
The World Day of the Manos Lavado is another example of a awareness campaign that aims to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emioc for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, in particular for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who just gave birth or soldiers in hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of the hands hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant oils called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne diseases and health-care-related infections have led the United States Centers for Control and Prevention of Diseases to promote more active hands hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The Portuguese influenza outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with japanese to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, cartels were held with "correct techniques to wash your hands" along with public bathrooms and bathrooms in offices and airports.
The phrase "swift your hands" is a statement that you do not want to do anything or share the complexity of something.
It has its origin in Matthew’s Bible passage in which Pontius Pilate laid his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader usage phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary weakness, which represented her guilt over the crimes she had committed and which had caused her husband to commit.
It has also been verified that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people have to wash their hands more often than others and have to value more elements for washing hands.
In addition, those who have been allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" compensation actions, such as a volunteer.
Religions recommend washing hands with hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without japanese, forms part of ritual washout in many religions, such as bathism, Hinduism, tevila and netitat yadayim in Judaism, the washing in Christianity and the Hudu in Islam. Religions also recommend washing hands in hygienic, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam are forced to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sijism, Judaism and Islam are forced to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace before the COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace before the COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the work site and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be willing to compete with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Occupational Health (OSHA), work with less exposure risk has minimal working contact with the public and working partners, for which measures to prevent basic infections, including hand washing, recommending that workers stay home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards and maintaining a clean and clean working environment.
Media exposure risk work includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who do not know or suspect that they have COVID-19 but who may be infected by the current Community transmission or an international journey.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large-scale minority sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protection equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that workers in health care and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19, are at a high risk of exposure, which increases very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering checks, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protection equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 brakes can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work by getting sick, by having to care for others, or by fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may vary, both in respect of what goods are requested and in the means of acquisition of those goods (such as buying in hours that are not cheap, by means of domestic or winding services from the car).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from the home and community environments and risk factors of individual workers, such as age or chronic health problems.
They also describe the controls necessary to address these risks and contingent plans for situations that could arise as a result of the offences.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Among the objectives of the response to a crime are to reduce transmission among staff members, protect those who are more likely to suffer adverse health complications, maintain trade operations and minimize the adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The risk control hierarchy is a widely used framework for hygiene and occupational safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrations and, ultimately, individual protection teams.
Engineering controls involve isolation of workers from work-related risks and can be the most profitable solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in the policies or working procedures required by the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of individual protection equipment shall be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g., respiratorys), used appropriately and systematically, reviewed frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Security (OSHA), work with low exposure risk has a minimum working relationship with the public and working partners.
The measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent washing of hands, recommending workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards that include covering towels and drying, the provision of paper and containers for wastes, the preparation for work or tours, if necessary, to discourage workers from using tools and equipment and maintenance of a clean and disinfection routine of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of persons who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have acute respiratory symptoms stay in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptoms during at least 24 hours without taking medications to relieve the symptoms or reduce fever; that health-care policies are flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, the average exposure risk works include those who require frequent or close to six feet (1.8 m) contact with persons who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19 but who may have been infected by SARS-COV-2 due to the Community transmission of the time around the company's location, or because the person has recently made an international journey to a place with overall transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of people and some large risk risk groups, with a lot of people and some low-sized retail selling environments. Engineering controls for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of high-quality air filter filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective barrier doors and the setting of windows for the maintenance service, so that the customer service can be requested from the car car car car. The administrative controls for this group and groups of risk risk groups include recommending to the sick workers who are at home, recommending that they remain at home. Engineering controls of the engineering for this group and high-sized group of high-sized-sized noises include the high-resources for this group and high-risk groups are included workers with the workers who are involved workers in the workers involved in the workers involved in the workers, the workers involved workers in the workers in the general public, these these these these include

The workers of this group of risks must often use respiratorys.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to care for the sick person and offering him a male to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper clothes when touching or drying.
The cabin crew should use unskilled surgical gloves to deal with a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body or surface fluids and, perhaps, individual protection equipment if the sick passenger has fever, your persistent or difficulty breathing.
Guantánamos and other waste products should be disposed of in a safe biological waste tank and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruisers and other passenger ships, risk controls include post-posting the disease, self-loading and immediately inform the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and childcare centres, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of the Community transmission.
When Community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or heart education classes or eating foods in the dining room, increasing the space between the pipettes, scaling the entrance and exit times, limiting non-essential visits and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of the classes. For police personnel carrying out routine activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
Officers of police forces are recommended to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 following the same patterns as emergency medical techniques, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers shall clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning towels before re-use them and follow the standard operating procedure for the maintenance and disposal of the personal protective equipment and the maintenance and washing of clothes.
OSHA believes that certain health workers and infants are in high or very high exposure risk categories.
Among the high exposure risk works are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnosis or COVID-19 suspects.
These become very high exposure risk work if the workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures are induction, induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High exposure risk morning works include those in which workers are involved in preparing the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; they are at a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19, even when they are performed by aerosol generation procedures.
The specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical and morgue care environments.
Samples should be manipulated by taking precautions at Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter are separated from different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they can have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet of patients who have been infected or are suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who are carrying out aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respiratorys with a filter mask approved by NISH or above should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory programme that includes tests for adjustment, training and medical examinations.
Other types of men can provide more protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective coins, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, they pay attention or transport them without conducting aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, gloves or facial protector, bats and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is carried out, the surgical mask must be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 breather.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, restricting access to a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those people involved in its direct attention, using the same mask without withdrawing it while paying attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and dissiplining the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

FECHA/HORA DE ENVISION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, universal time coordinated
LICENCIA: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we find ourselves in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges presented do not go forward, but we know that our best response is to the empathy, cooperation and global community building that conforms to this organization's core.
The camaraderie and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues in e-mail messages, calls and conversations are a great validation of how incredible the people with whom we are lucky to work are.
I couldn't feel more grateful and proud that all of you were my friends.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to reach Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Its work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites in place, helping our friends to receive their payment or to keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, from this coming week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our chronology
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to talk about our approach and our chronology for the next few days and months.
In that debate, we consider what we believed would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the organization's sustainability at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to remove stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to cut the speed, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contractors:
our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next week's notice.
We are not declaring a wounded; if you can work at a more normal time, this would be of great benefit to the mission.
However, the world is an indispensable place right now, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, buy or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not taking your time.
If he's sick, he's not working.
Although I shouldn't have to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to ask for a disease licence or free time paid; just report to your manager and help your team review the calendars and chronology to ensure that the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, warn Bryan of T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with support and ensure that the management is in the same situation).
People who work hours will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff partners who work on time.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if he is sick and can't work.
If he wants to work, he has our support.
Many people use the work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratuitous, especially in these times.
Again, it's about personal care.
What we ask of them is that they communicate with their manager so that we know what to expect and can correct us properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The Site Trust Engineering Teams, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fund Recovery, among others, carry out a critical work that could require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough jobs for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most important projects.
Reduced speed today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to put us in the day" when the pandemic ends.
It will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and we will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust us to our new reality and expectations of working hours daily, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Planning 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which devotes more time to the budget so that employees can give priority to critical work, personal care and the care of loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or wish to work with a reduced time in the coming weeks.
This extension of our chronology greatly reduces the current planning and pressure burdens on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform them of the next steps to the delegates and the teams only have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for its leadership in this situation.
State, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our partners in San Francisco's office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of San Francisco's office.
They used a hospital-use antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our room.
The building has adopted its own duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its employees.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol to COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has transferred its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the patterns shared with San Francisco.
As some of our friends in New York City know, we've also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still under way, but they are likely to take place.
Some of our fellow workers work side by side for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working in a remote way since then know that this mode requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings to intervals of one or two hours as a maximum.
If longer meetings are required, consider how to section them in the course of several days.
Defines the meeting with a list of topics and sends precipitation reading material.
Use the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection.
Design a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or take notes in a collaborative way).
Send an e-mail message to technical support if you need a comfortable voicemail.
Use the reimbursement for refrigerators.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to your friends about shared work
The RR. HH. Operation Team is analyzing maps on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week we ask all beneficiaries of Community subsidies to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editors, until WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could prevent them from carrying out their part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for maintaining or modifying those objectives.
This week, we will follow up with additional maps in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness for interruption and, in part, relief for clarity and capacity to focus on its own communities, both the Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT will be working to set up a Meta-Wiki page in order to provide you with a space in the community to monitor the impact and to follow up our communications with them.
Keep contact on COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 h, universal time coordinated 07:00 h, hour of the Pacific, for a special meeting of staff.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer their questions and spend time with each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information about this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these updated pages and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently very affected.
If you have any question about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything with which you may need help, you will not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and work as a link when necessary.
If they have confidential or delicate matters, send an e-mail to Bryan Juden, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Instead, it is a recognition that our work and our obligations are likely to be adapted in a way that had not occurred before.
These are the measures that we believe are necessary to support us constantly so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support us constantly and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need to take care of themselves and their families so that they can be found in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the team of Liderazgo (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cellular membranes) of the lungs cells, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 contravenes the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic diagnosis for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
Angiotensin 2 convertive enzyme is a metallic enzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal transporter domain of renal amino acids of cholesterol.
The ECA2 is a uniform type I membrane protein, with its enzymely active domain exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of the ECA2 is eliminated from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, solvent protein is released in the blood stream and, in the latter instance, is excreted by the urine.
The ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is attached mainly to the cell membrane of type II pulmonary alveolar cells, to the enterocytes of the intestine delgated, to the venous arterial and endothelial cells and to the open muscle cells of most organs.
The ECA2 MARN expression is also found in the brain cortex, the stranded body, the hypothalamus and the encephalic throne.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter ECA.
The ECA emits angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is a vasoconstrictor.
In addition, ECA2 emits phenylalanine amino acid carboxylic acid phenylamine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to form vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also expel several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the trade of membranes of the carrier of SLC6A19 neutral amino acids and has been associated with Hartnup's disease.
As a transnational protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the combination of S1 splica protein SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the surface of cells has resulted in endocitosis and transfer of the virus together with enzymes to endosomas found within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host's TMPRSS2 protease serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help to combat infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators have recommended that the CCA and the standard BRA should continue.
A review with systematic metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of neumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ECA inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with cerebrovascular accident and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in the mortality rate related to neumonia, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of neumonia".
The recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury and seems to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the leukoma with acute respiratory difficulty syndrome caused by lipolisacariads.
The average life of rhECA2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes apart from the 24-hour transition.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for those people with intolerance to the classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (SRA inhibitors) or in the diseases in which angiotensin II is found. The infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory difficulty.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with a person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the Government in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contacts tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, in relation to systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of the users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google announced jointly that they would integrate the functionality to approve these applications based on Bluetooth directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with joy, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
More than 200 Chinese cities are already in use. In Singapore a application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, it was launched as an open code application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia it was launched "StopKorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the application was pending the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government reported that the contact tracking application was in a advanced development phase and that it would be available for its implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application was planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol in Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry application for patients living in Moscow and have received a COVID-19 diagnosis designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Cambridge University Security Engineering, has raised several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including positive errors and potential lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add applications related to coronavirus in its App Store to "official" or trust organizations alone.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with coronavirus pandemics will be demanded once the threat occurs.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations presented a communication to require limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
the monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
monitoring and monitoring extensions should have exclusion clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
digital surveillance should avoid excessive discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protection against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights should be established to respond to such abuse;
will be required to participate significantly in all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published lists of controls.
The proposed plan by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent monitoring by withdrawing the tracking mechanism of its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, a network-based tracking has been used, rather than applications, to remove both the need to download an application and the ability to prevent tracking.
In Israel, network-based track was adopted.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data present significant privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created using central servers only for communication (see below).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application to carry out the tracking of contacts was used.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected trace information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the Government has also made information on the location available to the public, which is permitted due to major changes in the privacy laws of the information after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralised systems and privacy protection.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The trace of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published research re-mounted by at least 2013. By 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working in respect of privacy solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralised and non-centralised approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include the decentralised approach tracking to maintain privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and the protocols and mechanisms for the mobile communication track for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data shall never come out of the device and all equipment shall be in the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location data or route intersection to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technologies that allow your users to share delicate location and health data with other users and employees, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly consistent protocols formed the World TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect to achieve a broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace Protocol code used by its official government application.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google, companies controlling the iOS and Android mobile platforms announced an initiative to track contacts that, according to them, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
The specifications of the main technologies used in the system were also published.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
Implementation of tools for Governments to create tracking applications for official coronavirus protection of privacy
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planning to address the problems of persistent adoption and monitoring by first distributing the system through updates of the operating system and then withdrawing them from the same way as the threat has occurred.
b'Reperfilation (also known as restation or therapeutic change) is the re-adaptation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not for which it has been originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemical proteins, each of which has multiple links.
The analysis of these Union sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important daily proteins of SARS-CoV-2, there is the protein similar to the papain, the polymerase ARN, the helicase, protein S and the polyphosphate ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several components of medical interest which then optimised and analysed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquina is an anti-paludic drug that is also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the related chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would be among the four drugs that would be studied in the clinical trial of Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests in New York state with chloroquin and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and phosphate of chloroquine by an urgent use authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised as a U.S. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalised but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "use, dose or duration of hydrochloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of chlorine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
In Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are under way.
The University of Langone Medicine of NYU is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the prevention of hydrochloric acid use.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipiravir was clearly effective.
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen had a negative mean of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with neumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was administered to umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is weak and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reservations and that it would force the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Administration of Trump on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of disease if the virus has already been multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or try to design.
A lopinavir/ritonavir study (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefits have been observed".
Drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to change drugs to find a component that is linked to SARS-CoV-2's protease in the scientific community, criticism of the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of specifically developed drugs for HIV/AIDS has emerged.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
The remDesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and infection by Marburg’s virus. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remDesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple filviruses, neumavirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more severe disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remDesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at Cleveland University; one for people with moderate disease and one for those with a more severe disease.
Intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are currently being conducted for patients hospitalised and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with azitromicin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclesonida) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, such as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is ongoing and 200 severe patients hospitalised in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of the colchicin in reducing lung inflammation and complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolled in 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Embarrassed women who love or do not have an emotional anticokinetic method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
The low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published a report on its use.
On April 14th, a multicentre study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying much attention to the rehabilitation of antiviral drugs developed for previous outbreaks of SROM, SRAG and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese patents
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese patents
These are some treatments identified for possible revisions to the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (block IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
{NS}
b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop that vaccine.
Towards the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in safety studies in phase I.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak was spread across the world in 2020, resulting in significant investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As set out in April, the requirements of the ECPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, production capacity, scale implementation and overall access.
In April, ECI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were investigating and developing in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the days of the main platforms that took place in security studies in phase I are the following:
Nuclear acid (ADN and ARN) (developerator of phase I and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenvirus type 5) vector
It was reported that ECI scientists reported in April that 115 possible vaccines are at the initial stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milk Institute) and 37 others are announced, but with little information available (it is estimated that they are planning or developing).
A phase I or II test carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, is controlled by placebo and is performed on several sites, with more accurate and effective doses determined.
Phase III trials often involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, as they control the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet evaluated in humans (continued in the preclinical investigation).

Associates also announced plans for clinical trial and clinical trial in phase I for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 islanders and that, despite rapid progress, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus with partial funding from Canadian Health Research Institutes.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory investigation stage and evidence in humans is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large amount of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19", before which the German government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on ARNm.
The possible vaccine based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in clinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that the trials in humans of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a vaccine research alliance against COVID-19 which includes the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to the full investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other partners of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing in six possible vaccines.
The researchers from the London Imperial College announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an ARN vaccine with autoreplication against COVID-19.

By the end of March, the Government of Canada announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 medical research projects to counter COVID-19, including a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medical Initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh University Medical College announced the trials of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in rats and said that "the S1 subunit vaccines administered by SARS-CoV-2 received powerful responses from the specific antibodies (in rats) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probably nasal powder.
Using bacteria, DNA will be designated to replication into human bacteria and produce innocent particles similar to virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, along with computer resources in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud cloud.
Some vaccines have specific effects.
That means they can benefit more than the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
The initial studies to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic rat expressing ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, demonstrate the need to account for biosafety level 3 conservation measures for the handling of live viruses and international coordination in order to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SRAG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that the existing investigation on SRAG could be a useful template for the development of vaccines and treatment against infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, a vaccine against SROM (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were ongoing, all of which are vaccines of viral vectors, two of adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications in the social media promoted a conspiracy theory, according to which the virus causing the COVID-19 was known and already had a vaccine.
The patents mentioned by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SRAG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, stomach pain, loss of the liver and abdominal pain.
The time that passes between exposure and the start of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and four days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress in viral neumonia and multi-orgian insufficiency.
On 17 April 2020 more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been recovered. The virus is spread mainly among people during close contact, usually through coughs that are produced in tosser, shock or talk.
Although these gouts are produced when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or over the surface, instead of being contaminated in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touch the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the start of symptoms, although the spread is also possible before symptoms and later stages of the disease appear. The standard method for diagnosis is the reaction in the chain of polymerase with inverse inverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hesopharyngeal.
It is recommended that men be used for those who suspect that they have the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they not be used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory pathways, such as rashes, nasal cough, and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially brought pressure on the chest and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-orgian insufficiency and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to four days.
97.5 per cent of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not all patients have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is still not fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. The Centres for Control and Prevention of Korean Diseases (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of the confirmed cases continued asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78 per cent) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both spat and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking in a loud, free voice is more good than talking to a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth in the torser can make the gouts travel 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not often air-transmission, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the passage out of people's bedrooms gave positive effects on viral Arn.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) may cause respiratory secretion and air transmission.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading by the hexagons, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although it is possible to spread before the beginning of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not clearly easy to spread, a person is generally infected with two or three more diseases.
In particular, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in the plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this would vary according to humidity and temperature.
The apple and the protector are also effective if they are used properly. The apple products weaken the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, salt samples were taken in an average of two days after the beginning of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second test day.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related natural coronaviruses.
Outside of the human body, the domestic apple kills the virus, as it returns its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by the COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells by converting angiotensin I type 2 enzyme (ECA2), which is more common in alluvial cells of type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spice" (peplomer) to connect to the ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In the 12% of people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, a severe heart attack was identified, which is most common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammation response and the disorders of the immune system during the evolution of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be associated with the ECA2 receptors in the heart.
The ECA2 receptors have a high voice in the heart and are involved in their function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been detected in patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to a pronosic disorder. In the autopsies of people who failed by COVID-19, respiratory damage (DAD) and infiltrating lymphocytes were detected in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for epithelial cells that express ECA2 in respiratory pathways, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflation symptoms.
In particular, it was observed that the secretive T lymphocytes of GM-CSF pathogens are associated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretive monocytes and a severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocytes were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect disease.
The standard test method is the response in the polymerase chain with inverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is often performed in samples of the respiratory pathways obtained through a nasopharyngeal hesopharyngeal; however, samples of nasopharyngitis or rash may also be used.
The results are generally available within hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two different weeks and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that world laboratories could develop independent polymerase chain response (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, anti-body tests (which may detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but they were not widely used.
The experience in China with the evidence has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first diagnostic test immediately on 21 March 2020 to use it at the end of that month. The diagnostic models published by the University of Wuhan Hospital Zhongnan would suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
The contrasts in mirrored bilateral multilobular glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution are common at the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination may occur, the pattern in disorientated impeding (septal lobular growth with variable alveolar) and consolidation.
A few data are available on microscopic infections and COVID-19 physiopathology.
The main pathological results of autopsies are the following:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild neumonia: pulmonary oedema, neomocyte hyperplasia, atypically large neumacitis, interstitial inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes and formation of giant cells with multiple nucleus
severe neumonia: diffusion alveolar (DAD) with adhesion of diffusive alveolares.
DAD is caused by acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
healing neumonia: organisation of ovaries in alveolares and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoitroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and japanese frequently for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a toss or toss and, in the case of not having pans, use the inner part of the code.
An appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after touching or shaking.
CDC has recommended the use of teaspoons in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce contact with people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling multi-tudinal public meetings.
The distance maps also indicate that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As it is not expected that there is a vaccine up to 2021, as soon as possible, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing hands frequently with water and japanese for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when hands are obviously dirty, before eating and after singing the nose, towels or towels.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant which has a minimum of 60 % of alcohol, but only when there is no water and japanese available on occasion. For areas where hand disinfecters are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two forms for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for the antisepsis of hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisture.
Patients are provided with support, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have the virus use a simple male.
The oxidation by extracorporal membrane (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, a personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy nutrition have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalised with COVID-19.
Intensities and neurologists in the United States have compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophene) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health-care environments when procedures may arise that may cause aerosols, such as intubate or manual ventilation.
CDC recommends health care professionals with COVID-19 to place the patient in an air infection isolation area (AIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. CDC highlights the steps for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment are EPP bats, mascarillas, protective antennas and medical gloves. When available, respiratorys are preferred (instead of males).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by an emergency authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but do not guarantee effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not specified in the product indications.
When there are no masks available, CDCs recommend the use of protective helmets or, as a last resort, married masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is actively being studied for people hospitalised with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flux nasal channel or positive pressure on respiratory pathways.
It is still unknown whether any of these two provide the same benefit to people in critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flux nasal channel. Serious cases are mainly in adults (more than 60 years and in particular over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient head beds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation and 1.4% fell.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalised with COVID-19 finally move to the ICI.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 presents acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control and PPTE modes are required to maximize oxygen supply, while the risk of pulmonary injury associated with respiratory and neomotorax is minimised.
The oldest breathers can not count with high PPTE.
The study on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdestir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may last until 2021, several drugs that are already being tested are approved for other uses or are being tested for further use.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in efficacy and safety tests of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to convalient plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is in serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application may detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through monitoring data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends autoconferencing, but also alerts local health officials. The analysis of cell information macrodata, facial recognition technology, cell phones monitoring and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and those who were in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track the data on mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data from the location of telephones with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect violations of the quarantine.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulia Gallera said that mobile phone operators have informed you that "40 per cent of people continue to move."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackatoon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about the quarantine, travel restrictions and the side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect torture for the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease can continue to evolve slowly or without symptoms, so it will appear to other diseases of higher respiratory tract, such as common cold.
Light cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while heavy or critical ones can stay for three to six weeks to do so.
Embarrassed women may be at risk of serious infection by the COVID-19 virus, according to the data of other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but the COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more serious cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into the water respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorgian failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, changes in coagulation and heart damage, renal and hepatic.
The change in coagulation, in particular the increase in protombin time, has been noted in 6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19; while renal function change has been observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have high liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, a median period of seven days was extended between hospitalization and death.
In an initial case study, the average time from the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of between 6 and 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the rate of mortality among thieves was 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent among women.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples show widespread alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudated in both lungs.
Citopatic changes were observed in newborns.
The picture of lungs was similar to the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or heart disease.
According to the United States March data, 89 per cent of the hospitalized persons had a pre-existing impact, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region could also affect mortality.
The mortality estimates for the victim would vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient account of the light cases can make the mortality rate overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases committed in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The smokers had 1.4 times more likely to suffer serious symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or fail compared with non-smokers. They worry about the long-term cycles of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease of 20 to 30 per cent of lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung images suggest organ damage.
This may also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether prior infections generated an effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It appears that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases recovered from COVID-19 have been reported that subsequently gave positive effects to coronaviruses.
These cases are believed to be an increase in a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered to be natural and animal origin, by means of an interesting infection.
The real origin is unknown, but the spread of infection was almost entirely due to human transmission by December 2019.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, noted as the first date of the beginning of symptoms on 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary regionally and in time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall literacy rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240,191) by 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other measures include the literacy rate in patients diagnosed (CFR), reflecting the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and the literacy rate in infected persons, reflecting the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and continue to a specific population from infection to the resolution of cases.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these may provide information on how many people have been infected.
At the bridge epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) were already missing.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival festivals and affected the younger ones, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population is infected with antibodies, according to blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0,004 per cent of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and mortality rates are different for widows and women.
Mortality is higher between the varons in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk of thieves is for those in their 50s, and the gap between thieves and women is spent only 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in rats and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioural factors may be due.
The immunological differences based on sex, the smallest number of women who smoke and the fact that thieves have congenital infections, such as hypertension, could have contributed to the higher rate of mortality in rats.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected people were Varanese and 72 per cent of the people who were infected with COVID-19 were Varanasis.
By April 2020, the U.S. Government did not track sex information on infections by the COVID-19 virus.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influence and SRAG, affect widows and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and have more exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The head of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corone, VI to viruses, D to disease and 19 to the date on which the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with the international recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both disease and virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease for 2019-nCov as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication that no locations are used in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as natural rashes and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a breather and the supplier could not deliver it at the time required, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed during the night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories of speculation, false information and disinformation arose about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that quickly spread over the Internet.
It seemed that humans could transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in kerdos, potatoes, or pellets.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers are conducting international studies on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARD Study" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing potential vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ECA2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of that virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the virus COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this study focuses on protein S that helps the virus to measure in the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (ADN or ARN vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical examination of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocent copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes disease. It has been suggested that an early-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials were evaluated treatment already approved for paludism, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adapted antiviral drugs constitute most of the Chinese research, including nine trials in phase III on re-deciding in several countries and should report for April.
In April 2020, there was a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19. Several antiviral drugs are evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including the following: remDesivir, chloroquine and hydrochloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of the effectiveness of remDesivir.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with competitive use of remDesivir.
Clinical trials are being conducted at phase III in the U.S., China and Italy. Chloroquina, previously used to treat paludism, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for parental reviews for research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquina.
However, although Wuhan’s Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of grams, it notes that the double dose is very dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for the use of hydrocycloquine and chloroquine for discrepancy of patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese patents also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
It has been recommended that more live studies of nitazoxanid be performed, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The studies have shown that the initial protein S s-protein serotype 2 (TMPRSS2) serotype 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 input through interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine with or without azitromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of the serious COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment patterns after completing a small study.
It is found in a national non- Randomized Phase II trial in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with an analysis of serum ferritin blood to identify cytokine releases, these effects, which are believed to be the cause of the death of some infected people, will be identified.
The FDA approved antagonist of the Interleukin-6 receptor based on past cases for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome resistant to steroids induced by another cause, the treatment of T-Car T lymphocytes in 2017.
Up to date, there is no unanimated evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 from people who need them as a passive method of immunization is being investigated.
This strategy was approved by the SRAG with non-final results.
The virus neutralization is the mechanism of action expected by which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or fagocytosis.
They are developing other forms of passive treatment with antibodies, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
Convalent soil production, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
