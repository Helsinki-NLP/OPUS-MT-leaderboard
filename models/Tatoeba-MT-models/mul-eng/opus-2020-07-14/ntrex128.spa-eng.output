The members of the Assembly (AM, by their signs in English) of Wales are concerned about "the appearance of muppets"
Some members of the Assembly are disappointed by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Gales Parliament (MWP, by their rings in English).
This misunderstanding stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this can be recyclized.
A member of the Labour Party's Assembly said that his group was worried about "who stayed with Twp and Pwp".
For readers out of Wales: In Gales, twp means tons and pwp means cat.
A member of the Gales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Gales Conservative Party stated that his group was "open" to the change of name, but pointed out that the MWP-to-muppet-delay was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Gales is similar to that of the letter or in English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the change in the name, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the appointment of the members of the Assembly will be the subject of its own members."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales granted the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed wide support for the call of the Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Gales Parliament (or the WMP), but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes relating to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the inability of members of the Assembly and the design of the system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how they should be called when discussing legislation.
Macedonians call on the Urs to vote in favour of a referendum on the change in country name
The electors will vote on Sunday on whether the name of their country will be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote was called upon to resolve a conflict for decades with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its neighbour in the north poses a claim for its territory and repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO accession.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the Plenary on the change of name, has stated that the vote will be dismissed.
However, the rapporteur's party, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, insists that the change in name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
San Martín's campaigns are silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
" Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's nothing else."
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now socialist people differently," he says.
"The bars are no longer the rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors go regularly."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders wait and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by buildings of apartments full of the type of people who will not help the saints who remain in the village.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and, therefore, they will accelerate the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments are finally members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martin a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation was in the 30th century.
A black congregation that rendered worship close to the house acquired the building.
A black congregation took San Martín's reins, under the direction of Reverenti John Howard Johnson, who led a shop to street merchants 125, a main road to Harlem's purchase, which refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged, and while Father Johnson’s happy men planned to rebuild it, they also carried the trailer.
The Reverendo David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, called him "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the chariot called "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, expert Tiffany Ng, of Michigan University, noted that it was the world's first carillion used by a black music, Dionysio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church career 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martín did not replace it.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parishion council, the governing body of the parish, composed by lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing his concern that the diocese "has tried to pass the costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the contracting of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some happy people complained about the lack of transparency by diocese.
Tiburón yesterday to a 13-year-old boy who spent looking for lollostas in California
A tyburon attacked and fired a 13-year-old child on the Sabbath as he was trying to find lollosts in California the day the leisure period was opened, according to the authorities.
The attack occurred just before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV channel that he had been swimming with friends for a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, I thought he was just excited that he had caught a swallow, but then he realized that "he was screaming that they had killed him.
%s, Free space: %s,
he had the broken key," observed Hammel when he arrived with the child.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water because there was a tyburon," Hammel added.
The child was transported to the Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of tyburon responsible for the attack is unknown.
Soccer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press wheel that had been in the area a few weeks ago, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper part of the tower.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of tigers in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans stimulate the United Kingdom's beautiful market
Sansbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the steps of their style and beauty.
In order to significantly promote the United Kingdom's beauty market, estimated at 2800 billion pounds and with an increase that is increasing compared to the fall in fashion and home management, the biggest beauty passports will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they are successful, will be the same in larger shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use space in stars that are often directed to home TVs, microns and managerials.
Sansbury's said that he would double his beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other facilities, such as Boots.
The chain will also relax its Boutique makeup range with a majority of products that respect animals, something more often demanded by younger customers.
Also, in the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will test its concessions in two Saninsbury's facilities, the first one recently opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second will be opened in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the change to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local stores make it hard for supermarkets to convince people that they are visiting them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Saninsbury's, has stated that shops will become increasingly commercial centers while the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount institutions by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has integrated discount points from Argos in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has prompted the sales of food and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments was a failure.
Sansbury's tested a joint operation with Boots at the beginning of 2000, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the income of the pharmaceutical product sales points into its supermarkets.
The new strategy is based on the sale of 281 pharmaceutical products from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the aspect and the environment of our beautiful landscapes so that they can make the environment possible for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our brands offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an unresistable destination of beauty products, challenging the old way of buying".
Peter Jones is "freous" after Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pounds deal.
Peter Jones, Dragon's Den's star, was "frequent" after the TV provider Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million-book deal with his life-style business line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion brand and Truly plugins.
This business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old representative of This Morning announced that he had left business in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has inspired Peter Jones, Dragon's Den's star, by leaving his lucrative life-style business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was "frequent" when the gold girl of television admitted that her new contracts, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate to Truly, her fashion brand and supplements, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business has been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and has been described as a favorite to double the fortune of Willoughby, of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced that he had left business in Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly was, unlike, Holly's main priority.
It would be his long-term future, which would last for the next two decades.
His decision to give up all those who were fully involved left behind.
No one could believe what happened this morning, so close to the launch.
There is a full store of goods at Marlow's headquarters, ready products to be put on sale."
Experts believe that the output of this morning's presentation, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products that go from cojines to clothes, and possibly delay its launch further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago who maintain a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined him as president in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 per cent share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a program representative I'm A Celebrity on the ITV channel.
A source near Jones claimed that yesterday night "no business topics were discussed".
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
I voted in favour of the criticism received by the media for making a comment that some would consider "the presidency" and for being so positive about the Norwegian leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump commented with his voice bullona from "noticer of news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting again with him after Trump welcomed the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
The negotiations for denuclearization have, however, been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country did not see an "appropriate response" from the United States to the first steps for North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, it noted that the United States continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his interview.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had produced positive results: the end of the missile tests, help free hostages and bring the deaths of U.S. soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people there were trying to enter this full stage, we'd have about 200 people right here," said Trump, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and a earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, leaving hundreds of missing
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had had to move, there was no national emergency, a prior requirement for catalytic assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which makes things a bit complicated," said Mrs. Sumbong.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are still not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the representative of the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Bearing in mind that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly little prepared when nature breaks down its anger.
Although refugees have been built for tunamis in Aceh, they are not seen in many other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, has contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, travelling from one island of Indonesia to another presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will be at least three days after arriving at the shelter of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's waste infrastructure in the central axis of its electoral campaign, and has devoted much money to road and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's administration, which is facing a reelection next year.
In addition, it must face the pressure of persistent sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were missing, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets using masks, bows and arrows, and other handguns.
See this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the marker before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the First League in Chelsea with a gol in 89 minutes on the Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xerdan Shaqiri to something more than 27 metres from Chelsea's port when the marker was 1-0.
He put the balloon on his left foot with a touch before he launched it to the second floor.
The action was sent above the area and directed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed on top of Kepa Arizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell on the network.
"He was trying to put me in that position to make me with the balloon and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give me as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I see Kante approaches and gives her a touch. I don't think so, just launch the shot."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard marked a gol in the 25th minute.
The middle point of Blues made a taco pass to Matthew Kovacic in that game, before turning into a kingdom near the middle of the field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the balloon and ran out in the middle of the camp.
Later, he made a beautiful move to the space he took to Hazard in the area.
Hazard was sitting in front of the defense and finished throwing the balloon into the network of the second post with a pat with the left foot that Alison Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against Naples at the season of the League Championships. The meeting will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
On the other hand, Chelsea faces Videoton in UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims increased to 832
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the roofs of buildings that collapsed during the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 that occurred on Friday and that destroyed oil up to six metres, according to the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press round.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, remained covered by remains of the damaged buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after a woman was beaten to death.
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, who reportedly arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have invited people in the area who have seen or heard anything from the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the initial stages, but would encourage anyone who was close to Jonah Street, in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
In addition, I would recommend to anyone, especially taxis, that they have been able to catch something in a dashcam that they can contact us, because they can have vital information for our research."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and that she was buried inside a property.
This evening some people who think they know women came to the crime scene to know where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get in his room again, but the police tell him no one can come in or out of the building.
He fell asleep when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now informed that they will be allowed to come back in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a scene of the crime.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
Don't stop repeating "dangerous."
At two o'clock in the morning, there were two police cars inside the hall and another outside.
Several agents remained in the cord by controlling the block of spaces.
Any person who has information sending an email to DM @MerPolCC is requested to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at number 0800 555 111, register 247 of 30 September.
The Statute of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last memorable success by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban style of many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "locora" and a "one attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was impossible to remove the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
It may be sacrificed to Cromwell wrong by his predecessor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the history of a figure that many consider worthy of celebrating.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out in The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century, that at present, a defence of parliament against external pressure, in this case, is clear, monarchy.
If this is a very precise description, it is a matter of continuing with the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and remembering."
A real killer attack a Chinese winner
A hero attacked and killed a winner in a southeastern China market, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a split and covered blood artery near a pool in the Liupanshui market, in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a surgeon was prepared to inject vaccines to the pigs of a pigeon in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his firstborn from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigeons on the market.
The next morning, his first man found him dead and found out that the door of a nearby village was open.
He said there was a big brain with blood in his mouth in his pocket.
The forensic examination confirmed that the grain of nearly 250 kilograms had been attacked by the winner until death, according to the report.
"My first legs were enchanted and destroyed," said the first one, addressed by his nickname, "Wu", to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images of the security camera showed Yuan coming into the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan nor to his firstborn.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the jury was closed to prevent anyone else from attacking, while the police collected evidence at the site.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a hero attacks a person.
In 2016, a hero attacked a woman and her husband in his Massachusetts farm, leaving the wounded man in trouble.
Ten years ago, a hole nearly 295 pounds [295 kg] of grain fell to a winner in his tractor until his wife threatened the animal.
After some of them started in 2012 to win Oregón, a manitoba winner declared to CBC News that the bears were not often aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a "smoker".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... your intention is not to hurt.
What you need to do is have proper respect for them," he said.
The rest of the Rosa hurricane will leave powerful floods in the southeastern United States.
As planned, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves over colder waters from the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rivers across the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next days.
Rosa brought wind speeds of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane from Sunday to Friday morning (East hour) and located almost 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are starting to arise, moving towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the low California peninsula on the moon, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rain in the north toward the south of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some areas of Mexico on the moon.
Finally, when the tropical rain melts with the low pressure that is approaching, there will be strong generalised precipitations in the south over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous rainwaters, streams of debris and possible wastes in the desert.
Tropical intense rivers will cause nearly 3 to 8 centimetres per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain are expected in parts of the south, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Due to the widespread nature of tropical rivers, it is possible to produce frequent floods under conditions that rapidly worsen.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rivers, it is not recommended that you take advantage of the desert on foot.
The strong rivers could turn the canyons into frozen rivers and the storms would cause broken winds and dust clouds locally.
The low pressure approaching will leave strong rivers in concrete parts of the south coast of California.
The torrential rivers may leave almost two inches [2 cm] of water, which could cause small streams of debris and make the roads rebalancing.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the cold season.
Some dispersion tropical hats will begin to approach Arizona at the end of the Sunday and the first hour of the moon, before the rain is generalized at the end of the month and Tuesday.
The strong rivers will extend to the Four Eskines in the morning and during all the Wednesdays.
In October there may be intense changes in temperature in the U.S. by the cooling of the Arctic and the heat of the tropical.
Sometimes this suggests dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen in the entire center of the U.S. Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S., a warm start is expected, with generally heated temperatures that will range from 26 degrees south to the north.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures can reach up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows high probability of temperatures higher in the Middle East of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's comparison
More than 20 million people followed the disseminating testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, who was a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual aggression in the 1980s, gave the Thursday in six television chains.
Meanwhile, the policy continued at the point of death and the media interrupted its usual programming to re-examine the latest news of the Fridays: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Blake, Arizona, to enable the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford informed the Senate's Judicial Commission that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her in pregnancy status and that he was trying to get her dressed in an institute party.
During his passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company recorded the average audit in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that re-transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen tends to have some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playoffs or the Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose tertulants have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, burned the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a comparison that lasted all day, noted Nielsen.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NCB had 2.94 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million and the CNN had 2,52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the comparison, he was still showing great interest.
Flake was the central character of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate republican has issued a communication informing that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras were arrested on Friday morning when some protesters called on him when he was trying to get up to an elevator to attend a conference with the Judicial Commission.
While receiving these responses, transmitted directly by CNN, he showed abstinence.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are many women who don't have it."
Flake said his office had issued a communication and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would tell more about his appearance before the Commission.
The cable and radio broadcasts issued everything in direct hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's application to the Senate to vote for it.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated allegations against the candidate for the following week, which had been requesting some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, partly by the conversations he had with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Fleke made her decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
First Minister Theresa May charged critics with his plan to leave the European Union to "politicalize" the future of Britain and to raise national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The first British Minister, Theresa May, arrives at Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her at the newspaper's door, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to cover the other's tariffs was "all absurd".
Wayde's counsel: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU-boy, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-grade homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims lost his gates during the war.
The police recovered the cages in the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS's branch.
After asking Simpson, the police say he admitted to shoot Wade.
A $350,000 loan has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction judge This published a preliminary report on the Friday in which it indicated that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The Department recognises the merits of the unit of refugees from the State Police of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU sports director, thanked the police forces in the area for their "diligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played the soloist in LSU.
It had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 reboots in a game of the last period.
Tomorrow morning, Will Wade, LSU's Balloon Trainer, said his team is "destroyed" and "in shock" for the death of Wade.
"These are the things that people always worry about," Wade said.
A pink volcano in Mexico City
Ceenza from the Popocatepetl volcano has arrived in the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and censorship emissions at 24 hours.
The center recorded several drums and sacudides.
In the social networks, images showed fine scenes of censorship covering the parablies of vehicles in the streets of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres west of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced the anti-disturbies while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations matching the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized referendum on sex.
A group of separatists who had been caught by the anti-disturbians had cut their way out of their eggs and paint in dust, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also confrontations in later hours and the police used guns to contain the war.
For several hours, independent groups, with messages such as "not forgotten or forgiven", faced Unionists with the cry of "Viva Spain".
Four people were subjected to mild injuries during the protests, according to local means.
The tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters elected for the vast majority the independence, although the participation was low, as the persons opposed to the section voted in large terms the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote in electoral stations throughout the region, where violent confrontations occurred.
In favour of independence, the groups spent the Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support to the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he had no hope that Catalunya would be independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happily for the power to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although strict, in the regional elections of last December, pro-Catalanist parties have fought for maintaining the momentum this year, since many of their most well-known leaders, both in self-taxed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been warned by politicians on both sides.
"If you're becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in elections to the European Parliament next year.
"To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way of declaring the return to democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for excavating a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after reimbursing a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there were damages in access and in the building itself.
At some point, it may have been shot in the car with a ballast.
Menga's attack gives 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by getting the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 parties as the trainer of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's men took a position, with the Hibernian second position.
This period, Gerrard's men have not yet won any victory outside the house, and the next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
First, the Rangers receive the fast Vienna Thursday in the European Union.
In the meantime, Livingston expanded his race of victorys in the division of six parties. Holt, the master trainer, has not enjoyed the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets you pass opportunities to a contiguous visitor
Holt's team had to have taken a step forward long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson stepped up to the defense, but his attempt failed in front of the gate. Then, Alan Lithgow took out the shot immediately after he entered to complete Craig Halkett's head centre in front of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with the Balloon Games stopped.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston searched for an entrance, with a combined game of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, which hit the balloon and marked from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated possession, but they could not pass the defense of the host and the porter, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continued until the second part, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, the porter of the Rangers refused a shot of Scott Pittman from a patada, and Lithgow stayed away from another play of Livingston.
In the Livingston area, they were constantly taking long walks, but they were always disbanded. Two criminal requests were rejected, one after a Halket entry on Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingston's "Fenomenal" (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Stadium
An act and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
The unanimity opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of a rising trajectory.
Its game style and pattern have only experienced changes since its rise, but this is largely due to Holt in the way it has strengthened the team since its arrival.
I've had a lot of heroes.
Halket, the team's captain, was enormous and led a great-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerard, they remained short.
They failed to materialize the games, as they were only able to stand in the opposite field once, which is a call for attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambitious reception in Colombia
On Saturday, 29 September, there were sunrises and a blue sky during the breakfast of the Turkish and German leaders in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan went to Colonia to introduce a huge new mix.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathetic people stood on the steps to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
These manifestations reflect the disparity that this visitor, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist fails after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident took place near the top of the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a competition road from Deptford, on the east side of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was cared for by the paramedics, but he fell down there.
The accident happens after another cyclist dies after being hit by a vehicle that ran off in Childers Street, nearly two kilometers away from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been detached, and drivers who avoid the area have been advised.
Long Lartin Prison: six wounded agents after some disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in an alternative produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the Prison Centre.
The disturbances began in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. and continue.
Specialists of an elite team (named "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercads, in which they participate eight insides and affect a butterfly.
The agents received assistance for slight injuries on their face in the area.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: "A specialized prison staff has been deployed to deal with the incident in the course of Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff have received health assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that the officers will be put in the hands of the police and may spend more time between kings."
Long Lartin prison hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after his arrest.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbants were asked to go to prison to face a serious alternative in which prison personnel were attacked with billing balls.
The Russian hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with recent floods (arid areas could be benefited)
It is not uncommon for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week that comes when the last collection of the Rosa urcan crossed the south of the desert, with the risk of recent floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued alerts by continuous flooding for the moon and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada and the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa is headed directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of the moon.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented in a tweet that only "these hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storm or depression on a radius of 321 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre of Huracanes range from 5 to 10 centimetres of torrential rivers, which can reach the 15 centimetres in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpe, Arizona.
It is likely that they fall between 2 and 5 centimetres of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the south-east of the desert, including the Rock Mountains and the Grand Cuenca.
In places where there is no risk of frequent flooding, the rivers of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rivers are likely to be beneficial because of the dry conditions currently experiencing in the south-east.
According to the U.S. Sequia Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering, at least extreme drying, the second highest category, as reported in weather.com.
First of all, the Russian hurricane router will take advantage of the low California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, that Sunday morning will still have a hurcanized force with maximum speeds of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's losing power.
Thus, it is expected to recover in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm along the afternoon of the moon.
Strong torrential floods could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"There are torrential rivers between 7 and 15 centimetres from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimetres", as reported in weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at Arizona's border in the first hours of the morning as a tropical depression. Later, Arizona will move south of Utah at the last hour of the night of March.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-east of the U.S. desert."
These rivers are expected to result in dangerous floods and floods of forests in the deserts, as well as land degradation in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old had been arrested as suspects of a attempted murder after they had met another 16-year-old with white-arm wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
It was transferred to a hospital, where it remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two of 18 and one of 20 were arrested that same night in the Radstock area in Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suppressed the miggard and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voice in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the bitter and angry tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in a myth held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "pained the mix and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of appointment.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually abused decades ago when they were teenagers.
In addition, Ford witnessed at the session on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the "Americans saw Kavanaugh's passion, quality and bravery."
"Voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most successful legalists of our day, a lawyer with an amazing history of public service," said his followers in West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks pass for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not presenting it, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get big candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are aboard a "resistency and obscenity" mission.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held not later than Friday, a high-level task of the leadership of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds of missing in a earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged down by the huge waves that soak the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres reached the coast at night, drawing many to death and destroying everything at its feet.
Tsunami is produced after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When yesterday it was announced that a tsunami could be produced, people were still on the beach and did not immediately cry, so they were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (NPPB, for their indonesion signals) in Indonesia, pointed out in a press street in Yakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, drove cars, trucks, houses, pulled everything on the ground," Nugroho commented. The tsunami had moved by the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had come to the trees to escape from the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, flats and broken roofs, and a water mix.
The Replica continued to hit the city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a area of 2.4 million people.
The Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT, by its indonesion signals) reported in a communication that the energy released by the great earthquake of the Friday was 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found under the roofs of destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damages could be larger along the 300 km north of Palu, a area called Donghea, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralysed and there was no information" in Dongwa, Nugroho commented.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a communication, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms not to report that a tsunami had struck Palu, although the officials claimed that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an affidavit and shared in social networks, a man who was at the last floor of a building warning people on the road to approach a tsunami is heard.
In the matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, leading ahead buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the immediate material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great blow that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army started sending cargo planes with the help of Yakarta and other cities, the authorities declared, but refugees still need food and other basic products.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims by the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's something very bad.
Although the World Vision staff of Donghea have arrived healthy and safe in the city of Palu, where employees are refugees under lions installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's something very bad.
Even as aid groups launched disaster relief campaigns, some people complained that the transfer to Palu of cooperatives with extensive experience was not permitted.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, provision and provision of foreign personnel may be sought only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As the Government says that it considers it a national disaster, we can begin to provide international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
At the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of the wines, friends and family members of the people who were still missing, they still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the isolated stories that record natural disasters.
The Sabbath was brought to a little boy from an altar.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the shoulder for two days with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, the instructor of the national Indonesian parapet team, had trained two missing parapensists for Asian Games, who had completed that same month in Indonesia earlier.
Others who were caught in the Roa Roa Roa hotel, including Mr Mandiya, were students.
"For my experience in the parapet field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the announcement that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed in the parapet community, whatsApp had been sending desperate messages to Palu's competitors, who participated in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages showed only a grey check mark, not two blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Ladrons are carrying $26,750 during a recharge of an automatic casserole in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves attacked Brink's employee who was carrying an automatic case in Newport on the Levee, carrying $26,750, according to a press note from the Department of Police in Newport.
The driver of the vehicle had emptyed an automatic helmet located in the center of the ocean and was prepared to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for the recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects from the area, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Any person who has information on his identity must contact the Newport Police in numbers 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start calling you Ye.
He announced the shift on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
It's been a while since West, 41 years old, was named Ye, the name he used as title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
It replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel his action for "emotional reasons", as the programme creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, which means 'tu'," said West at the beginning of this year while talking about the title of the album with the radio player Big Boy.
"I am you, I am us, meaning us.
It turned out to be Kanye, which means 'the only', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers that has changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
An ancient West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in mauscules or minuscules, with or without guinea.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now about 50 years of a bloodthirsty repressive against students in the country.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, the troops launched a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left-hand student movements were becoming more and more popular throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to providing support to young Mexicans by giving them monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to become involved in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the financing of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an I.A. investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments are followed by reports on I.A. from several parts of the United States Government, even when, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan last year: its objective is to become number 1 in innovation in IA for 2030.
"Dublining the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, as all other countries go very far behind the U.S. We have the view in the next progress in the field of I.A.", notes Lee.
The double funding means that the next major achievement in I.A. is reached in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with the CBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editor Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, who has invested in one of China's most important companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an I.A. system that won the best US player in Othello. Later, he was executive in Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee acknowledged the previous US Government's technological competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would enable the next generation of viewers to identify.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee commented.
"It's not China that's taking the academic leaders; they're the corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired highly educated people from universities to work in I.A.
Lee commented that some changes in migration policy could also help the US to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The Council of State of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Artificial Intelligence Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China finance persons from academic institutions such as the National Foundation for Science and other governmental organizations finance U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, notes Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, whose purpose is to attract partners from industrial and academic areas. The White House announced the formation of a selection committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in I.A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation which sought to establish a National Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they would change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided on a referendum held on Sunday on whether their name would change to the North Macedonia Republic, a gesture that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbours in the north is a claim of its territory and has extended its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claimed that the change would reduce the ethnic identity of the Slovak population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign was in question if the participation would reach at least 50 per cent of the required referendum so that the referendum would be considered valid.
In the referendum paper, the question was raised: "Is it in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The candidates for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerge from Yugoslavia's deintegration, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live freely within the framework of the European Union, because this implies a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to be decisive.
The change in name requires a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported on one afternoon.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the last elections to Parliament in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, first Minister of Macedonia, his wife, Zorica and his son Dushko, deposited their vote at the Macedonian referendum on a change in the country's name which would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and removed chairs in front of the campaign stores planted by those who were going to book the referendum.
"We are willing to enter the NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with the very high head, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to join Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of Euro-Asian integration."
First Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO would contribute to the investment needed by Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is above 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last month by the Policy Research Institute, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which would lead to a lower participation of the applicant.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 per cent of the respondents had decided to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be more than 50 % of a vote.
In the event of failure, it would be the first serious attack on the policy of the proocdential government since it reached its power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Ağoro, from Manchester City, skips all the Bridgeton defense to mark a gol
Sergio Ağoro and Raheem Sterling reiterated the defence of Brighton in the victory 2-0 that Manchester City received on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Aguro, it was ridiculously easy to mark a hole in the 65th minute.
The Argentina midpoint received a passage in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenses before he entered the open field.
Once there, I saw a round of four green shirts.
He missed a defense before crossing several more on the Brighton area.
He took a walk to the left, where it was Sterling.
The English front used its first touch in the area to return the balloon to Aguro, who hit it with the right foot to avoid the porter Matthew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the network.
"There are some problems in the foot," said Pep Guardiola, the city's coach, to journalists.
"We're talking about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to mark a bullet at that time."
However, it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the content of the First League.
The gol arrived at the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguro received the balloon very much inside the Brighton territory.
He made a beautiful balloon pass on the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touches before heading to Sterling to the second floor.
The front of Sky Blues launched the balloon to the right network before leaving the limits.
The City faces the Hoffenheim on a team of Campeones League on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to party to the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the content by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
However, the always competitive Scherzer expects to force the assembly on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they are, they raced to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West League Division, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies ensured at least one Wildcard post thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can push the rubber with the assurance that the Denver public will be encouraged and that the other team will probably play at the highest level that I have faced this year.
Why didn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem to be reluctant to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would open his number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of Washington is of 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 and 220 entrances.
In the middle of West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his election to the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November it's playing everything we've done.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the most important. I'm not presenting it, but it's a career, so I'm going from one place to another fighting for great candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, see the mix, the evil.
They don't care who hurt or who have to pass up to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resistency and obscenity".
"We've seen it in the last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats "were angry, bad, terrible and false."
He referred to the Senate's Judicial Commission, appointing democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who received public services.
"Do you remember your answer?
Do you want to filter the document?
Mmm, mmm, what?
No, no, no, no, I'm waiting for an answer. Your body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of opinions.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was just surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Members of Parliament of the Labour Party who is told that he is not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a treatment that seemed to be categorically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe.
As was demonstrated in the announcement of the meeting of the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years in which I have been a member of the Parliament of the Local Labour Party, that is exactly what has been the evening meetings of the General Committee.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kinder" policy already being forgotten, if it is really applied at some point.
It is becoming more and more clear that discrepancies are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect radical change of opinion and to adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, either on national security or on the single EU market.
As long as I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a range of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, discontinuing the central policies, saying that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one you've experienced.
In fact, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I am surprised by the professionality and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of ongoing or racist insults, but never escape.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have this wide range of opinions and, with each motion "of censorship" or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that it would be "good".
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a secondary student, motivated by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher who left my school in total literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them more, either as a conceiler or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to recognize my political positions or areas where he was not in agreement with the current leaders.
The only thing I'd say to those who promoted the movement of the Friday is that I don't understand these hopes of losing time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country goes head to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any political opportunity will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Invited Ayr on top
Two tests at the end of the game may have decided in a certain measure the final result, but, no doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this interesting game of the day of Tennet's Premiership.
Now they head the table and are the only invited team of the ten who participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of its defence, as well as its capacity to take better advantage of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so that trainer Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
"We have tried all the parties and followed invitations, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: "Ayr deserves recognition, enjoyed the best opportunities than us."
Grant Anderson's test in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, was in front of the Ayr; but a yellow card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned by the Warriors for the party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this defeat of the opponent and Jason Baggot gained an unconverted test.
Climate expanded the Ayr's advantage with a penalty. Before, just in the medium time, he marked and turned a solo test, which left the marker in 17-5 for Ayr's rest.
However, the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption by a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, to whom they had to get out of the camel, and when the game was resumed, the Ayr progressed with a test of Stafford McDowell converted by Climo.
The yellow card at Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to re-use that they had a man with an unconverted test from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for paying Climo without the balloon, from the criminal line, MacPherson did a test when he was on the back of the wound that was moving forward.
Climo turned it, as he had done almost since the party was reinvigorated, after Kyle Rowe received the balloon sent by David Armstrong from a patada and sent it to Gregor Henry at the bottom to do it with the fifth test of the locals.
Still Game's protagonist wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, advocate of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restoration sector after discovering that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the Director of Afförmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "floating restoration market" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": a non-literal Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen the course to the Pacific
Mariners are watching a general shipyard in La Paz.
In public buildings, there are blue flags on the sea.
From the Lake Titicaca to the Amazons, the naval bases show the theme: "The sea belongs to us for the right,
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, a landless land still remembers the lost coast in Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to sail again by the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution of the International Court of Justice for one October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and seriousness and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will note the failure of the International Court of Justice in large screens distributed throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague court is pronounced in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to provide Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the indigenous charismatic president of Bolivia, who delivers a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has much to say about the resolution of the moon.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency, located in the Netherlands, has no power to assist Chilean territory and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice reached only six months after the final allegations indicated that the case was “not complicated”, said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia's cause, it may have been destroyed in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been delayed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales' beautiful retourism has threatened any good residual Chilean will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to keep conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusual.
The moon will be offered to Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end up to 139 years of mutual benefit disputes", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political model.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless you can trust the US.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says his nation will never be the first to bring nuclear disarmament to an end if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among the rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the moment when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear-related paralysed nuclear matters more than three months after this summit with the North Korea leader Kim Jong U.
Ri notes that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration ending with the Korean War to submit to the north is a "quimera".
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is a generalised scepticism on Pyongyang's seriousness to give up an arsenic that the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang the month that comes to prepare another summit among the mandaters.
Paris fashion files reveal the last line of huge shadows that are about to land on a store street near you
If you want to increase your collection of shades or fully protect yourself from the sun, don't look for more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of large-scale exceptional shadows for their summer spring collection in 2019 on the way, revealing the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible shadows have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the passerala.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige shade with a beautiful wide valley with flowers that involved the heads of the models.
Other large-scale supplements were sandwiches with joyas, a brown hat and even a pine, but they are not designed to keep the hot head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had cosy lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high-cost.
One creation reminded a full, snorkel- and gaffes-induced, while the other seemed to be a dehydrated ice-cream.
If you like the fashion of big size, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge shadows could begin to appear on store streets.
The big shadows come with a strong grip from "La Bomba", with a foot hat with a width of more than 60 cm used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The brand of worship behind this shade so little practical that the social networks together introduced another great creation in the passageway: a beach bag as large as the model in the bathroom that was carrying it.
The dark orange bar, decorated with raffles and a white leather ring, was the main part of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-war period 2019 in the week of the Paris Fashion Week.
As the famous artist Luke Armitage commented to F.C.: "The next summer, I hope to see huge shadows and beach bags in the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale supplements."
John Edward: Language competencies are essential for citizens of the world
The Independent Education Centres of Scotland have an academic excellence trajectory that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the individual and collective successes achieved in the areas of sport, art, music and other Community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS, by their rings in English), are striving to provide the best level of service to students and progenitors.
Independent colleges aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, to the career they choose and to the place they serve as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an appropriate study plan, it is noted that modern languages remain a popular and desired assignment in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak it in your tongue, it comes to your heart."
This is a powerful reminder that, if relations are to be established and to generate confidence with people from other countries, it cannot be relied only on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's examinations, we can note that languages are higher than the classification tables, while the higher approval rates in the independent colleges are higher.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest note A.
Data collected from 74 centres that are part of the SCIS showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied Germany, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools of Scotland support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will need in the future without any doubt.
At present, languages are considered to be at the same level as the CTIM allocations (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the Commission for Employment and Competition in the United Kingdom revealed that 17 per cent of the reasons given to entrepreneurs about the difficulties encountered at the time of job creation were attributed to the lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
The possible job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that someone has chosen, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last his whole life.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically adapt to competition.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language enough to maintain a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, the 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language education is now important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially those of the developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each college will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of a child, in independent colleges you can always choose between several languages taught by a personal teacher specialized in this matter.
The Independent Education Centres of Scotland devote all their efforts to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever their future.
At this point, it is unlikely that, in a global business environment, languages remain vital for the country's future, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "competences for international communication".
Independent colleges will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Independent Colleges Council
LeBron with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting of the fans who are waiting to see LeBron James in his first game with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will play the opening part of the premier that will be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to determine how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell published in a tweet that was likely to play for a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked by his plans for the pre-term program of six Lakers.
"In this stage of my career I don't need pre-time parties to prepare me," he said.
Time of Trump's Mitin in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign minions tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump's planned myths for the next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of its candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court pending, Trump intends to receive support for the next half-year elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's myth in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's myth in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, September 29, 2018.
You can see it online via a direct re-transmission on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump commented on the comments of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who were alarmed by the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and had been waiting for an earlier vote for confirmation of the Senate during, as many, a week while the FBI investigated them.
However, the main objective of this series of minutes is to help the Republicans who are facing the November elections to take the lead.
Thus, President Trump's campaign noted that the five minutes of the next week were "to encourage volunteers and supporters while the Republicans were trying to protect and expand the majority of those who remained in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so crucial for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as possible while we enter the campaign," said Reuters a Trump campaigner who did not want to give his name.
Posted at the Wesbanko Arena Stadium of Wheeling this night's myth could attract sympathetic "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as to have coverage in Pittsburgh's media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate at the West Virginia Senate, who is staying behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president has to come to give him an incentive in the investigations," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that it is about to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual parties on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, it may be that Saturday morning's forums are what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, more in competitions like these.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a little push," Jordan Spieth commented at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: four points ahead with twelve more in the game.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel that they have something of wind in favor and reasons to be excited, among other reasons for the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been a relative of tea to green and preach with the example.
The guitar screams of celebration rose from volume to volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital poutt to empathize the fourth party when he and Thomas went down two after two eggs.
The poet who gave them the party in the 15s was received with a similar call from those who believe that the U.S. team has not yet been out.
"What needs to be done to double the effort and concentrate on the party," Spieth said.
That's what these players have done.
18-year-olds to leave her.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange and devout couple in Europe wears four and nothing can hurt them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on the evening, but also avoided the bogies on the morning, the Friday on the evening and the last nine Fridays on the morning.
That race and the way in which it flows its energy with the public bulicious makes it clear that these are the players to whom it has to win Sunday, and that there will not be other popular players such as Fleetwood and Molinari to sell a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
preferable, both at the same time in different ways.
Even so, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson escaped to Sergio García, the hero of the four balles in the morning, after being married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the nine first days buried in the Spanish and Swedish in a cave of which they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no kind of help to get out of the caves.
The forums and forums are fascinating to see them close because they appreciate the interaction between couples, the advice they give and those they do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage over the last day, but this forum session has also shown that the U.S. team is about to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe is moving forward by 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe shares with a good advantage the last day of Ryder Cup, after finishing the forums and forums with a result of 10-6 on the United States.
The two motivations composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the content with two victorys on a Tiger Woods that was seen in dust, moving forward four points in the classification of Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophies that had been lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a U.S. team that made many mistakes during the morning's drills, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the forums, winning two parties, but it was not able to cut distances.
US Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual parties on Sunday to save the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first new European to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the support of "Molliwood" after a weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the suburbs, his magnificent union served to win a disanimated Woods and the new US Brison Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who had not been too high on the two parties on the Sabbath, had occasional moments of brilliantness, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 parties of furballs and fursoms, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who was restless for the breakfasts in the morning, returned to be Henrik Stanson's couple at the forums, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three of the world's guys, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the south of Paris, Europe did not have all of it.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the United States, getting two points on Saturday.
They won a passionate victory 2-1 in front of Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the suburbs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4-3 in the suburbs after losing both initial trees.
In the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovers from a difference of four points in individual parties only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as the owner of the trophie, just needs an empathy to preserve it.
Although it has been the best seconds for two days, it seems that carrying out an attack on Sunday is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "there's no possibility" that they will be destroyed first unilaterally if they don't trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its distrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would be left unifying nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the annual General Assembly of the international body that Korea had adopted "a major measure of good will" over the past year, such as leaving nuclear and missile testing, disarming facilities for nuclear testing and committed to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we received no similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will be first united."
Although Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea by Washington's resistance to a "for stages" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it makes gradual steps, its declaration is important, since it did not refuse without further unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has resisted calls to ease international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased the pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, even by putting objections to a declaration of end- of war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a camera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention any of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced to the U.S. leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korean leader in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party to denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in a similar stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was impossible to direct North Korea's missions to the U.S. soil after the "bad President" Trump, in a suicide mission, called Kim "cohete man".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage in the move towards disarmament, but said that she was still very much to do and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea was denuclearized.
The Wednesday, Trump said there was no time set for this: "We can be two years, three or five months, no matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions imposed by the Security Council must continue with and without compliance until the final and fully verified denuclearization is realized."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously in North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for the ballistic and nuclear missiles programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo spoke with Ri out of the United Nations General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again the month that came to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He was from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea complained that his "needs were the ones of a mafia".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to deporting a missile location and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "relevant measures".
Kim had informed him that the "relevant measures" she was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
Thanks to a new course that takes place this year at Harvard University, all university students spend more time in an attempt to fight the growing magic culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One teacher discovered that students from the university number one in the world do not often have any idea about the basic care of the same person.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, it is believed that the first of his class was in the United States.
Its motivation to launch the course arose after giving a talk on how the privacy of sleep affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she just got caught up in this, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of dream, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, in addition to improving general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students only sleep during the week.
The duration course includes an interactive series of tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom where students click on coffee bags, cortinas, sports shoes and books that tell them about the effects of coffee and light, as well as the impact of sleeplessness on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart disease, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, an icon of the camps with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the students' behavior immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the effects on tobacco smoking health," added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride for "to spend the night in the lake" still exists and added that modern technology and the pressure on which students have been subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping in enough time and a good quality sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a sense of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year in Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it all over the camp.
It is hoped that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students are thinking of setting up an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of the "white light" that emits the screens of electrical devices and LEDs, which can change the circular rhythms, so they would end up having problems to stay asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's gol tumba to Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another depression episode outside the house when Dolly Menga's attack destroyed the disarmed team of Steven Gerrard at a 1-0 drop in Livingston.
Ibrox's men wanted to get their first victory out of the house from the quarter of February 4th in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard twice in 18 parties as trainer, leaving his team at eight points from the Hearts, deposed leaders from the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred six minutes before the medium time, and the little little inspired alignment of the Rangers was not at all at any time.
Now, the Rangers are down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, behind the Hibernian for the difference of waves.
The Rangers may have had more problems, as the online judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a wound in his head after, of course, someone had to launch an object from the visiting fund.
Gerard changed to eight of the titlers who won the party against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scotia League Cup.
For his part, Holt drew 11 players from Livingston who started a point on Hearts last week and would have been happy to see how his organization team was able to beat the opponents at any time.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston better take advantage of the balloon when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes from the beginning, when Menga made a pass in space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the medium-camp was sent out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a lack of depth for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out for the long walk.
The Rangers recovered control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been sentenced in the 15th minute of the party, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but arbiter Steven Thomson made his way to the Colombian petition.
The Rangers obtained two shots at the port in the first half, but the old porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, just appeared in difficulties to deal with the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the brutal launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the gol marked in 34 minutes by Livingston came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers didn't dare to face a deep-fashioned balloon game of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher landed the balloon for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and went through Menga to mark the ball.
In the rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, since the flyer passed it to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block it.
Even so, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett spending a long time after each other.
Holt's men could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor kept firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head-hunter that didn't come in.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty to the end of the party after a meeting with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked to the other side.
German: Geiger Accountant Inventor
And now, a page from the German section "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany to the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as Geiger accountant.
The Geiger accountant, who has since become a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Campaigns of Coronado", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible papers of vacuum scientists:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
You can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans, "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the ill cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognize harmful cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
So they can "see" a common protein to many cancers and rejuvenate them.
A vaccine test is producing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the ill cells, saw as her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers called HER2, and then renew the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotions the growth of different types of cancer", such as mother, ovarian, lung, or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "instructing them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was aboard in a diaphragm in favor of Trump with a MAGA gor after its appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was engaged in a Saturday Night Live study following an error in which he commended the U.S. president, Donald Trump, and said he would be presenting the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the sword with the message Make America Great Again, he began to deport the Democrats and reiterate his support to Trump.
"Many times I talk to someone white and ask me how I can like Trump if it's racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL launched Matt Damon's sket program in which Hollywood's star was excommunicated by Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee on sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been re-transmitted, comics Chris Rock have been able to record West's bunk on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to redefine West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that it had been a bad thing to bring that gorilla.
"They set themselves up with me.
They told me not to go out with the yellow coat.
They set up with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what I'm sleeping?" and he added that "I'm going to put his hat on a superman, because that meant that nobody could tell him what I had to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Prove with love."
His comments were received by the public in at least two occasions and SNL members seemed to be ashamed, according to the report of Variety. One person said to the magazine: "The study was completely silent".
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose novelty, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West disappointed many when he went out on the stage to sing I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who killed: "To one of the most valuable spirits: GRACES FOR RESISTIR WITH THE MUCHEDUMBER."
Karen Hunter, the chairman of an interview programme, said that West was just "to be himself and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I decided not to give a premium to someone (by understanding his music or his clothes, or by supporting his art) who I think he's exaggerating and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed, saying that it was now "the person previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Trying to kill for torture at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackmore, according to the Police.
It is expected that the accused will be compared to the moon in the Court of First Instance of Belfast.
Taxation will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Tronos Game Star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for its role as Jon Nieve in the violent series of medieval fantasy of HBO, Tronos game.
The actor, aged 31, has attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that these screen papers were often transmitted to young boys who had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Tronos, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he seemed "very important" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think it's very important at this moment, Where have we been wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they now face?"
Kit believes that television can be part of the responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued, "What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
'Cause it's clear that something's been wrong with the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequal or cycle of Tronos game when the series ends next summer, saying he is "hard of war camps and horses".
Since November, Kit will protagonize True West, Sam Shepard's theatre work that tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever got out of Tronos' game.
"I knew my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic series with Emmy prizes.
The couple opposed their marriage in June 2018 in a castle of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of these were sexually infected, which meant a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in their practice as a whole, the Chinese health authorities declared at a convention in the province of Yunnan.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was abolished in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffered much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of men who maintain sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to medicines against HIV as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff will filter data from senators of the Republican Party and warns that it is "hazardous lies" and "conspiration theories"
The representative of Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published the personal data of three United States senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia pages on legislators.
The democracy of Los Angeles stated that these allegations were prompted by commentators and websites of "extreme right".
"Keepings, lies and more false cities," Waters commented in a Twitter publication.
Accordingly, the information published included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on inappropriate sexual conduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was carried out sometime after the three senators had been questioned in Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was associated with the Waters Office and made data from a member of Waters staff, according to the Chapter.
"This unfounded charge is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these false and false accusations, was not responsible for the filtering of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
The Waters statement triggered immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"I take this information seriously," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it is not the time you need to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he should not be provoked.
You don't have to rebel.
The reasons of the accused must not be questioned.
It must maintain peace and seriousness."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the response of Waters with the criticisms of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, to whom the dictators accused of being too angry during the comparison of the Jews.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant authorities and the entities responsible for carrying out the law of these fraudulent charges."
"We will ensure that the authors are found," he continued, "and that they are legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all my staff."
Critical by Johnny English: Again in action. The parody of Rowan Atkinson's species is short
Now it has become a tradition to look for guineas in Brexit in any new film with a British approach. This seems to be what it is appropriate to do with this new release of the parallel franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this self-sustained ironic about the clearly prepared that we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his unexpressed eyes and his unexpressed face, has renewed his license to put the pat on a second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, is a chemical creation designed for non-English language cinematographic territories.
Of course, it is the secret agent ridiculous that, despite his strange claims to defeat glamur, he has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean, and a piece of that kind that touched a single note on the theme of Carros of fire that was held at the London Olympics opening ceremony 2012.
In addition, its origin was based on the mysterious and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten news of Barclaycard's television ads, sowing the fall behind him.
In this last delivery, there's one or two good moments.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armory while the helices were shooting against the castle.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the view, but humor is very short and is extremely superfluous, especially now that film franchises "serious" like 007 and Mission are impossible to add chemical ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more directed to children than adults and, to me, the absurd distractions of Johnny English are not as clever and as true as the silent whiskeys of Atkinson in Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has been infiltrated in the supersecret network of British spies, revealing the identity of all his agents active in front of the arrest of the service agent, a painfully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the goth that melts the vase for the first minister, a pumice and accommodating character that is seeing how his political popularity falls: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much margin to work.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that, as all spies are in active danger, you will have to resort to someone who is withdrawn.
This has to be the Johnny English torpe, which now teaches in a pier college, although it gives extra-official classes about how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it's about a school of spying like rock school.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his former companion Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine doesn't use enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do the terrible things in the Secret Service of their Majesty return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the first minister is falling into the dangerous traps of a multimillionaire charisma in the world of technology that says he can solve the computer problems of Great Britain: Sister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their fear of absurd situations: they break down their bedrooms, take fire at an elegant French restaurant, drop the chaos hidden in the luxurious Yate of Volta, and, in addition, English becomes a pure anarchy by attempting to use a virtual reality box to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta house.
Finally, they were used in the last sequence, but, for the most grateful and streptitious of all, the group continues to convey a feeling to such a child.
A pretty regular product.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't avoid asking if the British cinematographic industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but it covers five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would cover five.
Accordingly, the party wants the owners of the companies to determine the savings obtained through the artificial intelligent revolution (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day free.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend of the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of "dangerous" in the plans and the economic agenda of the party to attract the country to the benefit of the workers.
This change to a four-day week has received support from the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take part in the changing economy.
As a high duty of the Labour Party commented to The Sunday Times: The announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved from one day to another, but the four-day working week is definitely a question that the party expects to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this type of idea, since the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, at the moment, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
One employer said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
Hazienda's minister in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "used" for public services companies.
The Minister's shadow plans also included the idea that current water companies shareholders would not recover all their participation, as a working government could apply deductions that would correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in corporate administration councils and to create inclusive property funds in which 10 per cent of the private-sector enterprises' actions to employees would be subject to annual dividends of up to 500 £.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk at "60 Minutes" about the FBI's research around Kavanaugh and if you could make them change their mind
The investigation conducted by the FBI on charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put at least one week's final vote for his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge and also raises the question of whether the results that were concluded could affect a Republican senator who finally decided to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, the journalist "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham discuss whether the FBI could bring them information that would change their opinion.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his fellow Caroline of the South.
"Of course, of course," said Kennedy.
"I was willing to proceed with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this, that he would come out and ask him, 'Did you do that?'
It's a firm, solved, silent."
Graham's vote, however, seems immeasurable.
"I've already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and I'd take the charge too high," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett secretly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she named have been able to confirm.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star map is gathered for a equally impressive mission: ending with poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will move to the Great Law of Central Park to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to realize the real goal of the event: ending with extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that is expected to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), the concert assistants have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", as volunteers, send e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that is needed to realize their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Citizen Global achieved in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert is a fine way to persuade people to take action or not more than a form of what is called "clictivism", which is called the post we take when we think we're doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favour of a large number of different objectives.
Through these actions, they claim that world leaders have been able to announce commitments and policies at a value of more than $37,000, which will affect the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10,000 has already been paid or reimbursed.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom combined with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential". To this end, Rwanda has been proposed to provide $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and co-workers of Global Citizens as you are, we can mark a small sign in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the Government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children would benefit from food-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions raised on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights movements have already been achieved before and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are some of the events that we will relate to the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. might use the Army to block Russian energy exports - Interior Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could resort to its army to prevent Russian energy from damaging markets, including the Middle East, revealed by the Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke pointed out that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates under legitimate government, is no longer a prerequisite for expansion in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier most south of Europe," he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Armada, has the ability to ensure that maritime roads remain open and, when the case has come, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia consists essentially in using and replacing fuels," he warned, as he pointed out that Russia alone can do something, which is based on its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to push its natural gas export to Europe and to recognize its role in Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, the members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, will turn to Berlin in a state of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11,000 million and is expected to double the current gas supply capacity of 110 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project only responds to economic reasons and is a further demonstration of unfair competition.
"I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be converted into a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the Secretary of Energy of the United States, last September in Moscow.
The US position, however, was rejected by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organisation leading industry in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"There is a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of presenting herself as a candidate to the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would study the possibility of joining the presidential career after the election half-mandated.
During a comparison in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It is time that women come to Washington to change our government fragment and that, finally, there are women among the leaders," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously take the opportunity to present myself as a candidate to the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a comparison with the Assembly and stated that "he was taking the country on the wrong path".
"I really care about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
The Thursday was published in which, however, most of Warren's own voters do not think they should be presented for the 2020 elections.
58 per cent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters stated that the senator should not be present, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
A 32% of the respondents, however, supported their application.
In the investigation, there was a greater support to the former Governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% of support before a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party discussed the possible candidate for 2020 by former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin talks about track Palin's postural stress disorder in Donald Trump's myth
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining him in September.
Last night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for all that's happened since he came back, is well known to other families who suffer the effects of the TEPT and other injuries that our soldiers return," said the public who gathered in a myth in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo of which no one wants to talk, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "come back with a different behavior, tired, asking whether there really is such respect for what his fellow soldiers and planes, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to his country."
The moon was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which involved a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police department of Vasilla.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims of domestic or pandemic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support to an asylum-seekers facing the current directive, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that the EU Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as nations facing generalized problems related to domestic violence and pandemics.
The new U.S. asylum policy rejected a 2014 decision that had taken the Migration Appeals Board (BIA, by its English seal) so that undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney-General of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday in which he stated that the new policy “includes decades of international, federal and state law”.
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must fail according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle," says the friend Careie.
Lawyers also pointed out in the letter that the policy prohibiting immigrants' entry damages the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "suppose a necessary job".
The Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum," said Sessions when this Directive was announced on 11 June.
The asylum was never created as a measure to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems facing people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while increasing the number of deaths in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in an escape center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute they get ambulances with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to re-suspend among the few alleged assets that they are in an effort to recover as much as possible.
There are hundreds of injured persons and hospitals, also damaged due to 7.5 magnitude earthquake, being displaced.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has the support and a broken home, rest on the outside of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside of the building due to repeated repetitions, also very strong.
He could not avoid crying when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
"I listened to my wife asking for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump, referred to China's Daily payment supplement in the Ten Months Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of wanting to join in the elections at the United States Congress on 6 November, something that China has repeatedly rejected.
The claim that Trump on Beijing's attempt to influence the US elections marked what U.S. officials indicated Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to publish ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports by both sides.
China's compensatory tariffs applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to be re-enacted to the exporters of states like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and former governor of Iowa, who is one of China's main exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, China "is intensifying that pressure with advertising publications in our free press".
"To try to spread its propaganda, the government of China is worth the precious North American tradition of freedom of expression and press free of charge when trying to publish a notice of payment in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"On the contrary, in the street corner where we are here in Beijing, only a few disparate voices are seen and no real reflection of the missing opinions that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory that is taking over the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant journals rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify what journal it was.
Analysts point out that the Republicans are away from women before the vote in mid-legislator with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many renouncing republics are closing lines in favour of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanugh in the face of various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts have warned that a delay, especially by women, may occur in the next voting held in mid-legislator.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have shown that they want to proceed with the vote.
"In this case it is impossible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, at The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) to position himself in favour of the FBI's investigation would be sufficient to calm down the disbanded voters on this issue.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman of the progressive movementOn group, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators gathered at the gates of the Senate announced "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the time when the Republican officers who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with the Kavanaugh's application, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats comes from everything pronosically," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partist political analyst at the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and, in fact, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among women who are not determined by the barriers and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, who do not often vote even though the president does not like them."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he had reported in detail his sexual abuse charges against the candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts indicated that a delay could be made if the Republicans continued to proceed with the confirmation.
"This matter has become a major issue for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is no longer just a matter of the committee's vote or the final vote, nor of whether they sit in the bathroom in Kavanaugh; it is also the way the Republicans have managed all this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the democratic election).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, although they're a few more than they're part of this last one.
In a new YouGov survey, 41 per cent of the respondents believe in the Ford testimony in a definitive or probable way, while 35 per cent claim to believe in Kavanaugh in a definitive or probable way.
In addition, 38% said that he thought that, with all likelihood or definitively, Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After the Flake campaign, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least the other complainants, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford bore witness under oath to the Senate's Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh was raped by 17 years of age.
On his part, Ramirez claimed that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed his genitals at a party when he studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the legend of technology. A company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "inline personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
The only thing that is exclusive in personal data storage is that the user is who decides fully who can access any type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the director-general of the company, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed to enable Solid to reach the world.
At the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template hired to work on the project and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a radical change where all their business models are completely modified from one day to another.
"We're not going to ask permission."
In a medium-based publication on the Sabbath, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Despite being launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next time of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Clergy That Wins a Cross Victory in World War I
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Cross Victoria during World War I as a warrior has been respected in its hometown 100 years later.
Colonel reversing Bernard Vann obtained this condecoration on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attack.
However, a francotheist killed him four days later and never thought they had granted him the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, their two grandsons discovered a monumental stone and a sculpture in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone would be discovered 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the condecoration of his grandmother.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a snowstorm and under the intense fire of amplifiers and cannons".
Then he ran up to the fire line and, with the "great bravery", made the line forward before reaching a rabbit with one hand and reaching three of the highlights.
Colonel Vann killed him on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he carried out his grandmother were "so great that I could never reach her age, but they were very exciting."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the exhibition, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was all a privilege for him to be part of the file" and added that "the value of an authentic hero is patented when it is shown to him so many support."
MMA's followers were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay awake all night to see all the Bellator 206 so that at last you will not let him see the main event.
San José's cartel had 13 wars, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom, he was going to be sent directly by night to Canal 5.
At 6:00, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face them, the United Kingdom Telespectors remained enthusiastic when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
To some he didn't surprise them after having had to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the war.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated drawings as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government policy that regulates the content issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication vice-president of Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Pappa la cerdita," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were going to change the program to include British spectators in the next issues.
"When I think about the retransmission option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be months for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
I believe that when the programming changed, a large number of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise that the next time it will not happen.
We will reduce it to five wars instead of six, which are what we normally did. We try to offer more than usual so that the victims were happy and we pass on.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triunfator.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn't count until the second time that "not all were like me".
In the first programme of the Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in discussing the rights of gays was to transmit "hope" to others.
He also told us to become a father who began to care for the importance of winning in the Olympics.
The usual representative of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months by illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, which appeared to himself as a marginalized person, he commented that he felt "lower" to the rest during his childhood, because "he didn't socially accept that children and girls would like you".
He said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what really gave me power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Games of the Commonwealth of this year held in Australia to claim that more countries are against homosexuality.
He said he told him because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without repressives, and wanted to send that "hope" to others.
The three times the world champion said that for him it was also a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American cinematographer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the last year with the winner of an Oscar, who was 20 years old, although she specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so young" (you went to your first Olympic Games with 14 years and your father died three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age that has passed by the same heights and under you.
The couple had a child in June who was called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, no doubt, Robbie."
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was whether they had the steps for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell you I couldn't be in the first row," she said.
"I had his hand between me when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that exact moment that he stopped breathing and died telling me that he wasn't invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I realized that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competed in the pool before mine in some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also what inspired him at the time of choosing his first song, Heather Small Proud, who accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing the yellow skin.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed in the bathroom at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup party, but he will have to turn his way if he wants to avoid becoming a sad dog.
Mickelson, who was playing on the event every two years to get a record for 12th time, was debanked by Captain Furyk for the holidays and holidays on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as has been done for the United States so many times, the five-time major tournament campaign had to be adapted to encourage at some point and, in others, to try to improve its game in the field and thus be able to correct what it is.
Never the most direct driver, not even at the highest point in his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best way for the Le Golf National field, where the long-term race is constantly punished with wrong shots.
And, if the field is no longer sufficiently disappointing, Mickelson, on the ninth Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they've played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, started in an impressive way, the Mickelson party might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his companion, I couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role I had today, gave me a palm in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be prepared tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Fama Hall and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't think of it playing two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how he went out and that's how we thought he should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's brand of more games played by Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of all a Ryder Cups trajectory that had never been so clearly equal to the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 gains, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more inestimable values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, intelligent, it likes to get used to others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think younger players have liked to have it as a support, too this week; it was fun.
It's a lot more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even if you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of Ryder Cup, you can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made his debut at the 1997 festival in Valderrama, where a band headed by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point advantage over the Americans, but finally they managed to end up with the other pianists by a minimum margin, winning 141⁄2-131/2.
"Don't stop to remember that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brooklyn and we lost it, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but very little," said Bjorn, retired, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History will teach me and the whole world that this team is not finished.
You had to give it all morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, that is to win this trophie, and that's the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, not more or less, than the best players in the world."
proud of what your players have done in a very hard golf field, Bjorn added: "I don't want to slow down.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails in the morning are individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, try all your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you have to send to the players, get the best out of the same morning.
Now it's about letting your partner go and get the best of one."
In front of Bjorn, his homologous Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as partners, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, which were three points of four.
The same Furyk has been at both ends in the last days of those big tournaments and has formed part of the team that won in Brooklyn and then lost when Europe carried out the "Millions of Medina."
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, was able to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
When all of us move forward in a direction, all the pressure comes in those intermediate games.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas we assigned him the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy at the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the second half of the list.
"I've been with this group of boys in this order because I think they're covering the whole trip," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, again
The new fragment of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old vessels of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that is headed by the new battalions of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now taken place by the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Armada in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery had made it difficult to complete the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuertmenberg class that requested Marine in 2007 will replace the old Bramen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of ancient missiles and antibuccos, as well as some invisible technologies, such as radar signals, infrared and very low acoustics.
Other important features include longer-term maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years from the port of origin.
However, the continued delays have led the ship's innovations (which were supposed to allow Germany to design its power over the sea) to be too early when they start serving, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 failed to keep track last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ass in Hamburg.
It's been the first time Marina returned a boat to an astilator after his delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficits were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuertmenberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 mariners: half of the staff in the former Bremen class's broken-offs.
It was also noted that the ship has a surplus, which reduces its performance and limits its capacity to add future updates.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the full cost of the project, including crew training, has also posed a problem.
It is believed that it has reached €3300 million ($3600 million), instead of €2200 million initials.
The problems that are being addressed to new obstacles are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of German shipping power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Armada is "remaining without ships capable of deployment".
The officer said that the problem was getting worse over time, because the old ships were given down, but they have not been replaced with others.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wertemberg class strands had been able to join the Marine.
The National Trust reflects the secret life of the mutants
This new investigation, which has been carried out in a state of Scottish Highlands, seeks to find out how the murciélagues use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected that everything that is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and will help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and supranational murals, as well as the daubenton river basins and long earmarks of Inverwe gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic property locations to track the activities of the mutants during the period.
The template and NHS volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds gathered in recordings to detect the frequency of the calls of the killers and what species they do.
A report and a map of the habit will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Adviser for NTS, expects the results to reveal what areas of habitat are most important to the musculoskeletals and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of forests and how forests should be maintained for the mussels and other associated species.
The slaughter populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are under threat of construction and development affecting their nests and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and electric cable can also pose a risk for them, such as insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks of domestic cats.
The killers aren't really blind,
but because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated eco-calculation technique that locates Hormigues and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the theme of the very serious massacres.
It has ten trained experts in the field, who are regularly conducting investigations, inspections of kidneys and, on occasion, rescues.
The organization has even opened up the first and only reservation dedicated to Scottish muslims in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Escocia.
The owner's director, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic area for murder," he said.
"We have old buildings, many Veterans trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about the mutants, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It emphasizes the importance of checking whether there are muslims before carrying out maintenance tasks within the property, as a colony of creatures can be destroyed indiscriminately and could be killed by 400 women and children, which would suggest that an entire local population should be neglected.
Murderers are protected and it is illegal to kill them, kill them or destroy them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer responsible for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said: "We still have much to learn about muslims and many other species that we do not know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape at the same time that his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has categorized rape complaints as "fake news", saying that people "want to get to know" at the expense of their name.
Their lawyers have received instructions to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where statements were published.
In front of Portugal and the Juventus he was accused of violating a U.S. woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375 000 to cover the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
With a video from Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers an hour after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, took the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the fifth winner of the Gold Ball watching the camera.
"They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story forever.
They want to be famous just to mention me, but that's how I can't avoid it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a request to Der Spiegel for allegations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspects in the area of privacy", reports Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damages by a number corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a follow-up to the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Maorga were reportedly at the player's room and there he was, in essence, raped by the documents recorded in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maorga said that Ronaldo broke up after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had broken that "one hundred" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was allowed.
Mayorga also says she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to come to an extrajudicial order because she had "dangerous to the repressives" and worried about "be humiliated in public".
The woman, 34 years old, claims she is trying to cancel the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to the Juve, a large Italian football for a 100 million € contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent all life" if it lost its position as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "occupant" that Toyota UK communicated to the BBC that, if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, production would be temporarily stopped in its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the effect of delays in customs duties in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cause loss of work.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures models Auris and Avenues from Toyota, produced some 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain collapses with the EU at the end of March, there will be production patterns in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director-General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other United Kingdom car manufacturers have shown their fears about the EU's exit without an agreement, especially with regard to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says she'll close her Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns faced by car manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of an unconventional Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the appropriate production mode (‘just in time’ or at the latest), where the pieces arrive every 37 minutes from United Kingdom and EU suppliers to manufacture cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, an interruption could occur at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and destabilization of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to rent the amount of equivalent materials to more than one day of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in that case, the production would cease.
Mr. Clark said that theresa May's Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "soundly calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way at this time but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence of Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what has so far been a set of supply chains that have been extremely successful."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the U.S. union in the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "As I know, once these jobs are lost, they will never be recovered."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that limits our future relations with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be resumed, according to the White House.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with general vice-fiscal Rod Rosenstein could "stand another week", as the debate continued on the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interferences in the Russian elections, links between the assistance of Trump and Russia, and a possible obstacle to justice by the president.
The expectation before Trump decides to reject the general vice-fiscal or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fed Washington's rats for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone that he himself had taken to try to contact the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused to be right.
However, last month he went to the White House, among news that he was about to give up.
A meeting with Trump (at that time in the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that "I wouldn't" defer to Rosenstein, but the meeting had to be held to prevent a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Court Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual aggression, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this might delay the vote of the Senate's plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, it could be this week or it could be another week, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We're going to decide on the move and I'm going to inform the press, like I'm used to."
Some journalists would deny this statement: Sanders has not carried out any press round in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press routes was not due to a warning to TV journalists who act with great tolerance, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfaron."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President held more meetings of questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, as he pointed out without proof: "We have opposed those numbers."
Press routes will continue to be carried out, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the President of the United States directly, I think it's much better than you do to me.
We tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press wheel when you could talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when going from the White House or when participating in public meetings or press squares with the dignitaries who visit it.
Press conferences with him only take place on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president showed why he was like this, where he made a detached appearance and, on strange occasions, before the journalists who were gathered there.
The Ministry of Health writes to EU workers from NHS Scotland about their fears in Brexit
The State Secretary of Health has written to the EU template working on the Scottish HHS to express the country's gratitude and its desire to accompany them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter only six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of citizens' requests for EU members working in public services that do not depend on central power.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have followed up on the departure of the decisions that were to be taken this autumn.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also intensified the preparations around a possible scenario in which it had not agreed.
I know all this must be very uncomfortable for you.
And it is, therefore, that I would now like to reiterate the value of the contribution of each staff member regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all EU and other countries contribute valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, benefiting patients and communities to whom we serve.
Escocia is, of course, your home and we would like to continue telling you."
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after suffering a wound in his head
Christion Abercrombie, the player of Tennessee State Tigers, was surgically intervened in an emergency after a wound in his head last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and was bombed right there," said Reed.
Both trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie in the band line before placing it in a camilla and bringing it to an in-depth examination.
A member of the Tennessee State plant told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, sophomore redshirt, is playing in its first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five taks on the Sabbath before leaving the camp, with those who took a total of 18 throughout the period.
Foreigners will be subject to higher fines when they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to higher fines when they buy a property in the United Kingdom and the extra money spent in this measure will be used to cover the "without cover", according to the new conservation plans.
The change will neutralize the success achieved by Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in fines tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year for "no roof"
The additional money related to the increase in the tax on the transmission of fines to foreign purchasers of property in the United Kingdom will be for aid to the "no roof", said Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is acquiring with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to attract those who have higher incomes.
The increase in fines tax will be recorded to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and this money will be aimed at encouraging government policy to combat the problem of medicament in the streets.
The recharge, which is an addition to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, resulting in an increase in prices and difficulty that people who buy for the first time can access a affordable home.
Many of the most affected areas in the country (in particular, in capital) have become "fantama cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson complained about a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He told the great builders to keep high prices in the property when buying land safely without intent to use it and urged Ms. May to remove the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "sudden housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, including rent controls and the end of unreasonably derogations.
It also proposes to grant the most powerful local power to build new dwellings.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my role as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of each new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastating.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy dwellings with greater ease than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has turned into something too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland trainer says his "primordial objective" is to become a trainer in Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is illustrated by the possibility of revitalising the Northeast Club, which currently occupys the third place in the League One (the third division of links in England), to three points from the first.
He passed to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking to St. Mirren again to the Scottish Premier the last time.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I just got a B gor," said Ross in Sports Sound in BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up to see Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always done that he wants to come back.
That opportunity will only become reality, however, if I succeed in directing a club."
Among the presidents of Ross as the leader of the Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former management of the Athletic Alliance says that he felt no fear when he passed so many names established in a club so big, after rejecting the proposals of Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, the success for me is measured according to whether I can return to this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club are undoubtedly the ones of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I can only think I've achieved my goal here when I can go back to the club where I should be."
Ross only spent three years as a trainer, after being a time assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the heart's technical body.
Later, he helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and made St. Mirren pass on the decline to win the championship in the next season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Probably it was aneccurated authentic," he recalled in reference to when he was charged with the Allaa.
"I always thought the direction was the best way to go, much more than to play.
It can sound strange, because it was good, I was able to get a very good life with it and enjoy some spicy moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of this work; however, I feel good in the direction.
He always wanted to train me, and now I have been able to do it, is the time of my adult life in which I felt better, no doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has prompted the gains in British pubs who struggle to survive, but focused all the pressure on restaurants chains.
Pubs and bars saw how their sales increased by 2.7% in July, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultancy, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England continues in the world have still made it possible in July to maintain the pattern of the month preceding June, in which the pops increased a 2.8% profit, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs that serve primarily food also suffered with heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, drinking sales rose to 6.6 per cent during the month, while food decreased by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, of RSM's Hostile and Eighty Analysts, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social events or sports events remain the most relevant factors for sales on the market outside home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the fall of 4.8 per cent in sales compared to last year will result in particularly painful results in the continued cost pressures.
The summer’s long and warm weather could not have reached the worst time for gastronomic operators and the time will tell if the moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand implants.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the United Kingdom restaurants, bars and pubs, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined invoice of more than $9,000 million and is the market reference value.
One out of every five children has secret accounts on social networks in support of their parents
One of five children (some even 11 years old) have secret accounts on social networks in support of their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted by 20,000 secondary students, revealed an increase in the false pages of Instagram
News has voiced the fears that sexual content has been published
A 20% of students claimed to have a "primary" account showing their parents
One out of every five children (some even 11 years old) creates social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in the false accounts of Instagram, a reference site for sharing photos.
News has exposed the fears that sexual content is published.
One 20 per cent of the students said they had a healthy "primary" account that they showed to their parents, while others were private.
A mother who found herself casually with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violar me".
The research conducted by the Digital Avarenss UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference of Independent Colleges (HMC) found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eliidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in Scotland's athletic federation directive
Elidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish Federation's non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most gifted athlete in the course and field of Scotland and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that sport benefits from its great international experience in the past decade.
"Eidh is recognized and respected in the entire community of athleticism in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly from counting with it in its directive," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I like to be the spokesman for the athletes, and I hope to be able to bring things and help develop sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four gold he won and is now a regular expert in BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a brain injury.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or what point I would do.
It has been overwhelming, but I was able to recover completely, I had to learn again to walk, and now I'm doing pregnancy exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of bags where mothers are compared with cows divided by opinion on the Internet
A gambling company has divided the public opinion on the Internet with an ad where it compares to mothers who give birth to cows to whom they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "first silent sacks of the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie published an inspired announcement in a video with some ironic music showing to mothers who have the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a garden full of hen in dance mode, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have her" and "For if you didn't notice, they're not grapes, they're my legs."
The heart continues: "Order them, order them, I feed their babies, order them, order them, I command my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a strong controversy.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it is possible to focus on the "docks" of the milk sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to lay eggs to announce this product.
Like us, they have to remain pregnant before giving birth to milk, except that they leave them to their babies days after birth," a person wrote.
Elvie milk extractor is clearly adapted to a lactating subjecter (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Trumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a milk extractor for mothers who are staying with their babies?"
Another comment was, "Go a more decoupled announcement."
Other people, however, defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted that the song was "distinct".
"I think it's a great idea.
If she's still going to be a mother, I'm sure she'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little alocated, but I don't give you any more back to it.
It's a product genius," a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It's a grateful announcement to mothers who use a lactating bomb (in times at work or in public places), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement it is neither praised nor judged by the milk sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have been dancing with the bombslights placed inside the subjecters.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely silent, does not have cables or tubes, and is secretly attached inside the milking subject, which enables its users to move, submit to their babies, and even get out the street with the bomb in operation.
Ana Balarin, mother's partner and ECD, tells us: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a humiliating and provocative launch.
In showing parallelism between expressive women and white cows, what we intended to call attention to the use of lactating bombs and their challenges, as we demonstrated in an interesting and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new bomb offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children jumped over the passageway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant minors detained has experienced a significant increase, although the monthly influence on the border has practically remained at the usual levels.
Traditionally, most of the parents, who were also undocumented immigrants at their time, feared that the fact of being proposed to take a child at risk would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that the parents and other adult members of their families should present their subsidiaries and that the data would be shared with governmental immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking officer of the Immigration and Customs Office, witnessed before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to be deported to unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed after 70 per cent of the arrests had no criminal precedents.
"About 80% of the sponsors or their families are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to process the least expensive minors, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the staff of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, instead of person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for the amphibians will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the staff of the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged over the past few months, the longer they remain under custody, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent arrests or refugee attempts.
According to the defenders, these concerns are increasing even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that due to its size, the signs of ill-treatment in these children are high.
In addition, moving to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to disarm their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moulam, also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moulalem, who is also the vice-primary minister, said that foreign forces were illegally located in Syria under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the theme "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that "war against terrorism has virtually ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "loose in this sacred battle until we purge all the Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land soldiers in this country destroyed by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moulalem stated that the conditions for them to return and blame "some Western countries" for "sustaining irrational fears" which made refugees decide to remain out of the country.
"We have requested the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment area in the last important rebel ship of Idlib has created an opportunity to strengthen political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large scale of Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulalem has made it clear that the agreement had a "clear time" and has expressed the hope that military action would focus on the Yihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (incarcated to Al-Qaeda), who will "be mistaken".
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the United Nations, is waiting to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to drafting a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way to elections.
Moulalem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump won a second mandate
According to this logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators will certainly expect, a destination or a scandal that will eventually end its presidency.
This would be no doubt "The most dramatic end of a seen presidency ever!"
There are currently no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the index reached at the maximum hearing time has doubled to 1.05 million for the CNN and has virtually tripled to 1.6 million for the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum hearing hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC has exceeded the cable channels by 3.5 million viewers for the main night news programs.
"It's an extraordinary attraction that we still cannot understand," Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designed Survivor", comments a dramatic series of the ABC on a secretary of the office who becomes president after an attack will destroy the Capitol.
In Scowell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he'd vote in Trump.
Why? He asked him.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer he received from Scowell.
The chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Of course, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming from Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families can meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only privileged viewers can be allowed.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you notice that you take six hours to see a panel of experts discussing the use of the "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-advised leather boxer ("a demeshed pride" in The Washington Post) and the implications of the extensive descriptions of Stormy Daniels of Trump's Anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's partly what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of "Pawn Stars", when we talk about the alternative department of Trump's show and its daily routes of the tram (whether entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I was talking to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day in the north coast of Kauai, but he was refugees inside the house seeing MSNBC when he wrote CNN.
I couldn't get rid of the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate's Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court in charge of a child.
"I remember when in those days we made all these programming holes and people told us that it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss tells me.
"I thought it was all a joke, but eventually it turned out they were right."

External money flows in the most adjusted half-mandatory elections of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the money flow is reaching the 17th Pennsylvania district, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress district with two candidates seeking reelection for the same stage.
This Pittsburg residential district, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his escape in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old district 12 of Pennsylvania, a district that is largely dissolved with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17 race has launched a funding content for campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (NCDC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congress in Pennsylvania.
This scandal had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support to China, even after leaving
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and hosted a hotel in Panama until partners left the administration team of the Trump Organization.
The officials of the Department of State decided to return to the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to cease recognition in Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a communiqué this month.
But only he decided to punish El Salvador, who had already received some 140 million US dollars 2017 aid for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions to certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior officials of the administration had made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which would end any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence intends to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if diplomatics, is seen as a sign of the importance of the administration of the meeting.
The three United States envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment by Washington.
A spokesman from the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations under the terms of anonymity.
Its explanations were consolidated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under an anonymous condition.
The Study of History
The next proposed step could be the report of Special Advocate Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to the justice of Trump, which already has considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also carrying this research into the possibility that the Trump campaign is working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Trump will see himself making accounts in front of that camera, just when he prepares to meet again in front of the voters, and perhaps finally in front of a jury of his parents.
This is a lot of conditionalities, and I do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, not even its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the duration of the content.
In 1938, German officials were ready to give a state strike against Hitler. Only the West had to resist and support the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that followed.
The passage of history revolves around these inflation points, and the inexorable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflation points.
What will we do if Trump sends out to Vicefiscal General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's research destiny?
Rosenstein has been in a good position since this journal reported that last year he had suggested writing in secret to the president and had been speculating about his inability to carry out the task.
Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we answer if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair, or if its duty is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual aggression and the testimony of the deceased?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections a Congress that will report to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my home of embassies.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to warm the streets of the Sabbath on the same beautiful table with a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic in front of the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive attack in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to be classified in Group G of the European League.
An injury on the wheel prevented mediocamp Graham Dorrans from reaching his first appearance from the period until the impact of 2-2 against the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trap for larger things.
"We managed to get a good point out, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the game believing we could get something and get out with a point.
Maybe we could have achieved the victory at the end, but, in general, the empath was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another big European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good outcome in the previous game, but with all the public backing, I'm sure we can advance and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a general environment that will all be welcome.
The team is good, the boys are having a lot of fun and we're having good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past period and succeed."
The fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose their dream
Despite the fact that the investigators had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking about it with their families.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children on this subject.
"People want to take care of a family, but they are not taking steps to have this conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your wife and children: you will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes with sufficient advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determinant factor in the cost.
Include in the conversion to your financial adviser, as it can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care funding options may include a long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with real value to help you cover your expenses or make sure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Trade your legal documents: advance to legal battles.
A medical care authority is required to designate a trusted person who oversees his medical attention and ensures that professionals comply with their own wishes if they cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a nodular power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his behalf and ensure that his invoices are paid if he is incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that they are always the point.
"It's not just the money they're playing: what doctors are dealing with?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned."
Shoot a man several times with a carbine in Ilfracombe
Several times they shot a man with a carbine as he returned home walking after he left for the night.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was found in the area of Oxford Grove de Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdominal and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British hour), as a "a random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have made a call to potential witnesses.
Terremotos and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said that the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With closed communications, assistance officers have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongâna government, a region in the north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Dongía, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dondéna is a kingdom that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of littoral in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region which is considerably lower than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the northern region of Donganga.
Nikhal mines are also important in the province, but they focus mainly on Morouli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodangaa have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghea.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donghea in 1996, with nine deadly victims.
Indonesia is located in the Cinturón de Fuego del Pacífico, a region of great sysmic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
We then sum up some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the province of Achh in Indonesia, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and led 226,000 people to the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
There were hundreds of dead victims on the island of Nias, in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most popular island, and caused tsunamis that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 deaths.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the government of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic in remembering the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami caused any tsunami, but the destruction of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate to Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29 years old and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when a known police officer tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he left his phone.
Palin has been sentenced to preventive prison in Mat-Su Pretreal Facility and is held with an unencumbered loan of $500, KTUU reported.
He was present on Saturday before the court, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when he was asked for his statement, he informed the chain.
Palin faces three minor crimes in Class A, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a minor crime in Class B, with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time there are criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of joining his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering in the prosecution of a crime of domestic violence and of possession of a weapon in the state of emergency, in relation to the incident.
His bride had said she gave him a bullet in her face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior with the disorder of post-uramatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
Terreto and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people lost after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside the center of Sulawesi, which is located in the north of Yakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that surround social networks and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal taxes are exceptionally seeking the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal taxes are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, reportedly used a home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike on the West Side of the Manhattan Bay highway, crossing the petons and cyclists he found on his way in the past October.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intently” and had “intensely” serious bodily injuries, in accordance with the warning of the intention of the death penalty application presented in the South New York District.
The two charges brought a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury brought Saipov a 22-load charge that included eight murder charges with organized crime, which often used federal taxes in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to the prosecutors, which described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and detached".
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," is a statement of intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York has been processing a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was declared guilty of killing two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to eternal chain in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a New York federal case was performed in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit a spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The two Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of reimbursement during the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired to see ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that ISIS's flag be put out in his hospital room, the police said.
It has been declared innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defence lawyers representing Saipov, said that they are "of course disappointed" with the tax decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt with eternal chain sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously applied for taxes that did not require the death penalty.
Mr Tory said NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "movilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UKIP said politicians had to "sound the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that he should be involved in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative spokesman Peter Bone said at the Berlin concentration that the United Kingdom would "have already gone" if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile its divided lines has become even more evident when a group of Tories in favour of sustainability has joined an opposition protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitment that has been signed in Chequers in the midst of the attacks of those favouring Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies stressed that they would continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "caos".
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that a position should have been given to Farage with responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would've already gone," he said.
This Member of Parliament by Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must defeat Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to serve them.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
He was disappointed at the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that we have changed the British opinion and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory Pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concentration, where he said to reporters: "I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote in favour and it is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going to the streets and vote for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The first ministers keep their duties when fulfilling their promises."
Farage told the concentrateds that it would be necessary to "sound the heat" to politicians if they saw that they would betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them out with theirs."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feels hot.
"We will mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us victory with Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the favorites of the stay traveled the streets of Birmingham before a couple of hours in the city centre.
Some activists were wearing Tories Against Brexit cards after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis was inspired by the conservators by the security problems they had with a party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for the harmony border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of presenting himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "he will consider all the possibilities of presenting himself to the presidency" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a usual criticism of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican State Representative, who was co-chaired by the Tromp Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren faced Trump in 2020.
The Sunday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with the electors using the municipal format since Trump took over the job.
An assistant asked him if he had intended to present himself to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for women to go to Washington to arrange our irregular government, and that includes that there is a woman at the highest level.
An arrest for the murder of LSU Sims's gun
The baton Rouge police (Luisiana) announced this Saturday that he was arrested by a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, the LSU Balloon player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who was watching the video.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was killed by shooting near the Southern University campus in the first hour of the Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shooting wound in his head that eventually caused his disappearance," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wade was defending a friend and got a Simpson shot.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had been in the scene of the crime, owned by a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, an original baton Rouge player of 1.98 meters high, played 32 games the past season, being titled in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 reboots per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas was classified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has been evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the field, Bottas had a good start, and almost stopped Hamilton from defending his position on the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the boxes and let Hamilton run in the group car, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went out with force a later turn and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed after an action with almost stuck wheels that made Ferrari's pilot have to give up his inner life at risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who served 21 years that day, began from the last row of the parille and placed in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race while holding his neumatics to a quick end and going over to Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered boxes in turn 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight times when he recovered Raikkonen the fourth position.
It was a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and it was a real horseman when he let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That's been a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump was excommunicated by Senator Diane Feinstein on a myth on the Sabbath because he insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter should not be filtered in which he accused of sexual aggression against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a myth in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the witness for Ford to the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there were people who were "bad, repugnant and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that's happening in the Senate these last days is when anger is seen, when it comes to people who are bad, rebellious and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the filters, and then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
You remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't filter it," he added while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent to him in which the charges against Kavanaugh were described by Ford in July and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein refused to be re-filtered by his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and, therefore, did so."
But his negatives did not seem to sit well with the president, which during the afternoon of the evening, he commented: "I will say one thing: that has been a really bad body language."
Maybe I didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defence to the appointment of the Supreme Court, which has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnance, they don't care who hurt, who have to struggle to gain power and control," said the president, as mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two bullets for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the weekend in the Elite League in front of the Belfast Giants by winning the party back on Saturday at 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants won an initial prize of two dollars thanks to the attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local empathy before Dwyer restored the Giant leadership.
Francois Bouchard adapted to the Dundee before the two waves of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three parties.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance so that Beauvillier could double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very animated initial period, Sullivan returned to the local team with a wish to play at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the game at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants would take advantage of the first break when he announced his second round of night at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once more matched the game with a ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the party when the end of the second part arrived and he assured the win with the fifth goal of his team as the end drew near.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five parties, play at home in front of Milton Keynes in their next party of Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape from the airport
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being called a hero after his death to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to safely disappear.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The replication forces continue to absorb the area, and many are found in the castles in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in the airport control tower Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu. That tower was being hit by a strong balance.
It was firmly maintained to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the track at that time, could be safely detonated.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was breaking down.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation portal, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian channel ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he fell this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of dead can reach several thousand people, and the National Disaster Mitigation Agency states that access to the cities of Donghea, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many ruins under the ruins and it has not been possible to contact many people," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, commented.
Some waves that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which will celebrate a massive funeral on Sunday.
Assistance and supplies are being carried on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being taken everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help the survivors wherever possible, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the army of the country: "I ask all those who work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are they ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia had already been absorbed at the beginning of this year by earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the plane crash in a lake
The airline, which operated a flight that was thrown into a bay of the Pacific in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated healthy and saved the plane that was flying.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that a male passenger could not be taken into account from Saturday morning.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the aircraft was deployed against the water while attempting to land in the Chuuk airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Company and the U.S. Army said the plane landed in the lake before the track.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the ground track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"That's something extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes notes that he and other travelers were able to make progress through a water that reached their destination until the emergency exits of the plane began to fall.
He said the flight assistants were panicked and screamed, and he suffered a slight injury in his head.
The U.S. Army said that mariners who were doing some improvement work on a mussel also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane fell some 30 feet (100 feet) below water.
The aviation security data indicate that 111 people have been missing in air companies registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of smoking alive to a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
I explained to the jury the way he used the mobile phone records to record Quinton Tellis' movements, the 29-year-old accused, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the street on the Sabbath and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "goin', because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
The mobile records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"The waste of your life," said Hale.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the judge to be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A third hip hop wants to fill your music with positive messages to hold the negative image of the gender.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that the hip hop separated from its political messages and dealt with social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make the conscious hip hop be popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent refurbished in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl asked a couple to send her away after a "racist" text
A New York girl is going to ask a spouse for a discriminatory divorce after she has received an erroneously text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the claim with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed his opposition when he found out that the new child nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when he arrived at his first day of work in 2016.
"NoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she was sent to Maurice twice.
After taking into account his platitude, a "incorded" plastic-Flaxman sent Maurice by saying that his former nephew, who was an African, had done a bad job and that he was looking forward to a Philippines instead, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for work one day and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now requesting the spouse for compensation for the delay in order to receive a compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months of internal work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't do that," he told The Post on Friday and added, "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple replied to claims that they were racist saying that the end of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable one, since they feared they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife had sent you something I didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been great with, even though it was wrong?
Your recent birth?
Come on!
Comparing the demand as a "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months ago and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going for someone like that?
That's not that it's a very decent thing," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the court of public opinion has taken action to accuse the couple on social networks, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers wouldn't identify with a mouthpiece, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was hard to place someone who read it for the first time before his publication.
Thank you very much to know what we now know about the great success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who had worked in the BBC camera before he was inspired in a playout to write the book for children, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was something "agriculture" after his failure last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to borrow," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child that could achieve something important: you are proud of him, though not really worthy of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to throw myself off the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked in the bathroom to save her life.
"I didn't call regularly to say that the situation was really bad, which was not expected to achieve it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to leave her.
And that's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep the bomb in his heart were slowly absorbed and left his system.
She had died before time and everything was gone.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all of this was happening.
I couldn't jump, cry or cry because I found myself in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep myself firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, following the terrible experience that was taking place.
"No one knew," he said.
"I almost lost my head and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this awful feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Women in battle put cards to prevent suicide is a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from leaving their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing cards in a gas bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers to whom people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer depression and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, from 45 years of age and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lighted anywhere."
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was found "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after he left his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that it can have effects."
Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can meet and who you can talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't feel quiet, you have to talk to him."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his wife, who was 15 years old, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he would feel depressed or anything like that," he tells us.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed their change of attitude.
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said that his death was a great tragedy for them, but they had to overcome him: "Let a vacuum in the whole family.
He's left us destroyed.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh takes place at the moment the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what was asking (a limited investigation in time, in limited scope), we could perhaps bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on the Sabbath, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "going a little" in the midst of a party parallelation.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI's investigation to be carried out?
Its negatives are due entirely to chronology.
Only five weeks are missing for half-mandatory elections on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their efforts to achieve the man they wish for the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressureing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh knew his wife, Ashley, who was the Chairman's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the pact and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "caen" deserters' figures with Kim
The number of North Korean deserts in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un reached power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of the South Uniting, said there were 1.127 deserts last year, compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Park said the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates that cover trafficking in persons have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this matter.
The vast majority of the north-east deserts are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
It says only that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) strongly protected between the two Koreas.
China believes that deserters are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have discussions focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting in June between the Presidents of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed in general terms to work on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without the US's confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will never be the first in unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls "historic" to Brett Kavanaugh and says it's not enough to serve at the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority of the Chamber of Representatives, said that the appointment to the Supreme Court was "historic" and was not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it was a story," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness that Kavanaugh gave the Thursday to the Senate's Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh was moved to deny the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were two teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasions almost crying and screaming while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the Committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats , commending the charges against them against "greatly and clearly coordinated waiving" organized by fed liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that this could not serve in the Supreme Court because it demonstrated its parity against the Democrats.
"I think it decalates itself with those statements with and how it has persecuted Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when they asked him if he would impose Kavanaugh on him if he was confirmed in charge and that the Democrats would get most of the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it won't be enough not only to be in the Supreme Court, nor will it even be to be in the court where it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible judgements of Kavanaugh against the Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be cancelled.
"This is not the time for a historical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to feel all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to punish him.
It's a justified diaphragm, it's months and years of anger breaking apart, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, don't you think?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was executable in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: "I think I'm sad because I'm crying.
So no, I'm angry."
And then he followed what he was doing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the clearest memories that I have of one of my first works, in a man-dominated office, was once I found crying with an inexpressable anger. One older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, got caught up in the coma and dragged me to a ladder.
"Don't let them never see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've got you together."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a democratic congressman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when they took Hart on an extra-territorial adventure on board a ship called Monkey Business for which I had to withdraw from the presidential career in Schroeder, it occurred to him that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she himself would be presented to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very premeditated decision," he told me between rice 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancanieves and the seven orphans."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind the fund-raising, so it was promised that it would not go into the race again unless it was worth $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to men, only $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he announced his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude by the people who had supported him, frustration by a system that was difficult to raise funds and focused on the arrest of voters instead of delegates, and angered against sex).
"The logic would have been to think that there had been a nervous crisis," Schroeder said, recalling the press reaction.
"You might have thought Klenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put in my leg?
"Lloro"?
Trade War between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first weapons of trade between the United States and China were incorrigible, and while there is still much to do with the end of the war, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts believe.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year when the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium, were placed at the beginning of the year.
The most significant scaled took place this week with new rates affecting 200 million dollars (150.000 million pounds) in products, which charge half of the products coming into the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent repressions, recently applying five to ten per cent of North American products at a value of $60,000 million.
China has committed itself to equalizing US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon collapse.
Finding Washington retroceeded would mean surrendering to demands, but being publicly submitted to the United States would be too ashamed for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays well its letters, US commercial war pressures could help China in a long-term way by reducing interdependency between the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can be made under conditions to begin a fall in the economy in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asia's issues for the strategic office Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country destroyed by a war that has taken more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moulam said that the country ' s conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists have destroyed to try to restore normality.
All conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of life have already been established.
The United Nations estimates that, since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are six million other people who still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But it also stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that promoted insurgents.
Europe with Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the American team with a final marker from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States has now brought six successive defeats on European soil since it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, launched his exit point to water on the 16rd floor, thus acknowledging his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since he began the current format of the tournament in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth fell by 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest rating of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 before Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already taken eight Ryder Cups, has become Europe with more victorys of the tournament all the time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It is a success of the entire team and I am very happy that I have been able to help," said an excited García after the victory of the European team.
Now it's time for his partner John Rahm, who has already destroyed the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods for 2 and 1 in an individual party.
"I feel an incredible pride when I beat Tiger Woods, because I grew up looking at this man," said 23-year-old golfist John Rahm.
Woods lost the four parties in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a statistical stranger for one of the best players of all times, who has won 14 great titles, staying behind Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a large level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointment of his team: "I'm very proud of these boys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning in which we heated the situation in Europe.
But we forgot to lose it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have performed a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will proceed.
I want a lot of these 12 boys and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's touching our head.
They've overcome us."
