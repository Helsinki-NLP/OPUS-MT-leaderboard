Members of the Great Assembly are worried that they will be "like Mupeti"
Some members of the large assembly are contiguous with the proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – member of the large parliament)
The proposal is therefore intended to amend the name of the meeting to the Parliament of the United States.
Members' meetings, despite political spectrum, are concerned that the name could lead to fraud.
One member of the Labour Party stated that his group is afraid that "this is happening with Twp and Pwp."
For readers except Wales: In the majority twp means pictogram and pwp means speech.
A member on the side of Plaid said that the group as a whole "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Grand Conservative indicated that his group was able to change the term "with an open mind", but noted that MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the large letter "w" is similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is now preparing a legislative act for amending the name, stated: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly will be called, of course, will be on the members themselves."
The Law of the Great Government of 2017 granted a great assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public advice on proposals where broad support was obtained to call the Assembly of the Great Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the meeting, the Commission gave priority to the name of the Welsh Parliament Member, or the WMP, but the MWP option received the largest support in the public debate.
The members' meetings clearly propose alternative options, but the fight against reaching consensus may bring to the attention of President Elin Jones, who has to submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of members and the proposals of the committee system.
Members' meetings will vote on the issue of their title within the framework of the provision of new legislation.
Macedonians are going to vote for a change in the name of the country
On Sunday they will decide whether their country's name will change to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
Allegation should be resolved for decades of ongoing conflict with the neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of the northern neighbour represents a threat to the Greek territory and repeatedly protests against the EU and NATO request for membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is a repellent of the name change, announced that the vote would not be taken.
The representatives of the referendum, including the presidents of the Government of Zoran Zaeva, also argue that the change of the name is simply a price to enter the EU and NATO.
The call to St. Martin is silent because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
"The old people I talked to say that he used to be on every corner of the bar and the church," says Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
The removal of bars is understandable according to him.
"People are dealing differently today," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms in the fourth place where people walk regularly."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as their representatives expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As he adds, the churches could be restored by apartment buildings with a living room of a kind of people who do not help the rest of the saints in the fourth place.
"Most people who buy houses in these houses will be white," he says, "and it will soon come when these churches are completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these homes would become members of the churches."
Both churches built a white congregation even before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin, ten years later.
The original white methodical congregation departed in the 30th century.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, whose worship was soon to be practiced.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the direction of the Reverendent John Howard Johnson, who was standing in front of a small shop at 125th Street, the main shopping mall in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise the blacks.
The fire was badly damaged in 1939, but when Johnson's father's fans planned his reconstruction, they ordered the sound of the bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and his successor to St. Martin, called the sound of the "the voices of the poor."
The team, which played on the bell in June, called it another: "cultural heritage" and "non-recoverable historical tool".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first sound in the world to be played by the black singer, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger sound room in the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one's ever hurt him in St. Martin's.
In the past few months, St. Martin has played a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom have been invited by church representatives, others by Episcopal Dictionaries.
The Council of the Elders – the leading authority of the Farthest, consisting of the medical representatives – sent in June a letter expressing concern that the diocese "will try to raise costs" to the council of the older, although the appointment of architects and founder who did not participate in the diocese was not yet taking part.
Some French people were struggling with insufficient transparency on the side of the diocese.
He was injured in California by a 13-year-old boy who fell for a humour
According to the official report on Saturday, he attacked and wounded a three-year-old boy who fell to the ground in California on the day of the start of the season.
The attack occurred just 7:00 a.m., near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he had been in contact with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he talked to him with the whole group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel pointed out that he first considered the call to be a joy from the spring, but then “you realized that he cried ‘ Help me!
Ask me!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he realized that he had “a wide range of key bones. ”
"I called for all of them to come out of the water, saying, 'The water is green!' adds Hammel.
The boy was in a critical condition brought to the hospital of Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
We don't know what kind of monster is behind the attack.
Mr. Larry Giles at the press conference indicated that the noise was already in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous type.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury in the upper part of the body.
The investigation and security authorities closed access for 48 hours to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans to enter the cosmetic market in Great Britain
Saninsbury's wants to be set up by the boots, Superdrug and Debenhams cosmetic streets in the style of the shop, where specializers will be available.
In the context of a strong market access to cosmetics in Great Britain, which has a value of 2.8 billion free and further growth, while selling fashions and household needs will be tested in 11 markets throughout the country. Then the next year will be extended to other sales.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find use for the rules used in the past for television, micro-trailers and household needs.
Saninsbury's states that the double size of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and first introduces and marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also be obtained and existing range from the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees characterised places similar to those in shops like Boots.
Supermarket also introduces its variety make-up Boutique, so most of the products will be vegans, which young customers continue to demand.
In addition, in the two sales of Saintsburys will test the concessions of the retail trader Fragrance Shop. The first such trade was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and another year will take place in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Buying on the Internet and cutting off on a daily basis to buy a small quantity of food in local shops means that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Director General Sainsbury's Mike Cupe says sales will continue to look more like business houses, because the supermarket network is trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discontinuants like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of shops sold around Argos and set up a series of Habitats, which are chains that bought two years ago. As a result, food sales increased and aquizies are even more profitable.
The previous attempt to convert the supermarket into a spacetic and medical class was unsuccessful.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s joint venture with Boots was tested, but the connection ended after the ruling on the distribution of profits from the sale of medicines in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury sold his 281 physicians for 125 million pounds to Celesio, who owns his nurse Lloyds.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury brands to the four sellers, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Business director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We changed the look and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in highly trained colleagues who will be able to deal with customers.
Our range of characteristics should satisfy all the needs and the smooth environments and useful positions mean that we are now presenting an attractive place for the purchase of cosmetics that changes old ways of buying."
Peter Jones is "exploited" after Holly Willoughby left the contract for 11 million pounds
Dragons Den Peter Jones's series star "sudden" after Holly Willoughby's TV moderator left the contract at $11 million with his lifestyle symbol to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and Truly's office.
The surrender of this pair was compared to the meaning of Goop's hero Gwyneth Paltro's.
Seven-year-old modator of the series announced a departure from the Instagram.
Holly Willoughby opened up the Dragons Den Peter Jones series by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business – to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the information provided by Jones, when the television star in the middle of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of the new contracts – in value to 1.5 million pounds – it will no longer be able to buy enough time for their domestic clothing and membership of Truly.
The subnet was compared to the Goop heretic Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of Willoughby's moderators in the estimated 11 million pounds.
When seven-year-old Willoughby on Instagram announced that the mark of Truly leaves, Jones came out of Britain to one of his annual seats.
The aforementioned source states: “Truly’s approach was a totally primary priority for Holly.
It should be her long-term future, which will ensure her for a few decades ago.
Her decision to leave all the participants simply shocked.
No one could believe what's going on in the afternoon, the landing was so close.
In the centre of Marlow is the full stock of goods prepared for sale."
The Committees are of the opinion that the departure of the moderators of the Order of This Morning, which belongs to the most prominent British stars, could enable the company to be able to invest millions in the products of plastics and candles after clothing and household clothing and any delay in the identification of the mark.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tarry Capp.
Willoughby founded the mark of Truly with Tary Cappov in 2016 and two-year-old Jones joined in March as president of the presidency.
The money runs on a permit, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby has to become the Ambassador of M&S and will reward Anta McPartlina for updating the I'm A Celebrity series on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs. ”
Hard to deal with "and then we fell in love"
He tweeted about the criticism received from journalists for a note that some consider as an “inappropriate president” and about how he was willing to speak about the North Korean leadership.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
The trumpet was answered by his deceptive "voting" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that after their first Red Meeting in Singapore, Trump considered it a great step towards denuclearization in North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the settlement of nuclear weapons was on the dead spot.
More than three months after the Red Summit in Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to world leaders at the UN Valén Assembly that North Korea does not see "responsive response" on its first steps to defend itself.
Instead, the United States continues to have sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
The trumpet in his show expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great in North Korea," he said.
"We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
That would last millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, he said, brought positive results – ending rocket tests, helping with the release of arms and restoring the rest of the American soldiers to their power.
And he protected his unusual access to information about Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to act as a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside, we'd have about 200 people who would stay right here," Trump said and pointed to the tax before him.
Free Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the islands and killed hundreds of people
In the post-Lombok earthquake situation, for example, a foreign non-governmental organization learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboku were expelled from their homes, there was no national disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit convenient," said Mrs. Sumbong.
Organization Save the Children Network gives a team that leaves to Palu, but it's still not clear whether a foreign staff can work here.
The national disaster speech agency Mr. Sutupo said that the Indians assess the situation in Paul to find out if it would be possible to help international organizations.
Given that the earthquake occurs very often in Indonesia, the country on the Maddy of Nature is still unfortunately not prepared.
In the Acehu network, a network of anti-tsuns were built, but on other parts of the border, it is not quite common.
He likely contributed to the loss of human lives and the apparent lack of siren guards in Paul’s presence, even though warnings were issued.
And in the best time travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that sailed to Lombok and helped the earthquake victim is now moving to Paul, but it will last at least three days before the arrival of a new catacomb.
The improvement of the poor Indonesian infrastructure was mainly due to President Joko Widodo's volunteer campaign and the president lost a lot of money on the roads and railways.
The next year, he will again force the election, but his government will face the consequences of funding.
President Joko also suffers from persistent sectoral pressure in Indonesia when members of the Muslim majority take a more conservative form of faith.
Half the fighting between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed thousands of lives and tens of thousands have fled from their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool shot the same branch against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge took care of London's Stamford Bridge in 89 minutes and saved Liverpool from the explosion with Chelsea in Premier League.
Sturridge got a dog from Jerdan Shaqiri about 27 meters ahead of Chelsea's defense when his team lost 1-0.
He moved the sword over the ledge and shot it into a distant hole.
The shooting was high and led to the real top edge of the defense.
The sword finally crossed the scavenger Capu Arizabalagu and ended up in the network.
"I just tried to get to the right place to get the sword, and players like Shaq always play the most ahead, so I wanted to get the most time."
"I saw Kante close to me, so I didn't think too much of it, and I shot one touch."
Chelsea led the Belgian star Edena Hazard in a period of 1-0 at 25 minutes.
The runner Blues sent the dog back to Matthew Kovacico, then turned around in the middle of the church and pointed to the half of Liverpool.
Kovaci's sword was running fast.
Then he sent a sword to the beautiful street of Hazard into a trap.
He ran away from the army and ended up in the van next to Alison Becker from Liverpool.
In the middle of the 15th hour, Liverpool, a group of Master's Leagues at San Paolo Stadium in the Italian Neapolis, runs with a local team.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of floods in Indonesia increased by 832
As the Indonesian disaster authorities introduced in the morning, the number of victims of earthquakes and floods was 832.
The 7.5 earthquake struck on Friday, caused waves of up to 6 meters high, and forced many people to enter the narrow buildings, said Sutopo Purvo Nugro's press conference.

The Socha Cromwell in Parliament has recently been hit by the governor of the "recording of history"
His exhilaration would be rewarded by the fact that his fanatic Puritan followers in the style of the Taliban destroyed a number of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr Crick's proposal "visitivity" and "a dream of rewriting history."
President Cromwell of the Society John Goldsmith says: “In the ongoing debate on the elimination of tears, it was imperative that Oliver Cromwell become one of the goals of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not organize or perform iconoclasm in the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the sake of his predecessor Thomas in the past century."
The sacred creation of Cromwell, whose author Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century’s view and of the part of the history of the situation that many think is still worthy of being praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, even though today is much less than at the end of the 19th century, in front of parliament than outside pressure, in his case, of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this statement is the subject of unexplained historical debate.
It is true that the conflict in the 17th century created the next development of our people, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable institution that represents one side of this division.
His success in the role of the Lord of the Protector also stands for praise and remembrance."
Killing powder broken down by a Chinese farmer
According to local media information, the market in South-East China was attacked and killed by a pharmacovigilant.
As the poet of South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, the man in which only the name "Yuan" was introduced was found dead with a blood clot in a blood clot shortly on the market in Liu-pchan-shuaj in the province of Kuj-chau.
The hairdresser is ready to apply the swine vaccine on Wednesday, 30 May 2005, in Si-ng, China province of Čching-chaj.
In the middle, he came with a cousin from the southern province of Yun-nan to sell 15 piglets on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and found out that the door to the next door was open.
According to him, he had a big tumor with blood pressure in his chest.
According to the information, the forensic investigation confirmed that 250 kilograms of tissue had been broken down by the pharmacist.
"Bratranec had his feet full of blood and broken," quoted Lieutenant Guiyang Evening News's fraternal, which marked the name "Wu".
The security camera record shows how Yuan came into the market on Thursday, 4:40, to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man did not care for Yuan or his cousin.
The director of the market told the agent Evening News that the pig was closed so that no one else could find it when the police gathered evidence at the site.
Market representatives have reportedly joined Yuan's family to punish him for his death.
It's nice to see people's haircuts, but they've come to them in the past.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm in Massachusetts and her husband was critically injured.
Ten years ago, 300kg of dust added a large farm to the tractor and left it to the farmer's wife.
After a Ukrainian farmer had eaten his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood tastes can function as a “sustainer”.
"They're playing.
They're scientists... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
The remains of the Rosa Hurican bring to the south of the USA strong rain
Hurikán Rosa, according to the forecast, is weak and moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But the next day, it's going to North Mexico and South America.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa reached wind speed 137 km/h, which represents a hurricane category 1, and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Ross is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, the bridge forms low pressure and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the island of Baja California in the afternoon, she will have a similar tropical storm and start to push tropical humidity north to the south-western part of the USA.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa, it will bring up to 250 mm of rice in the afternoon.
Tropical humidity then with the approaching low pressure current in the following days will cause potential rainfall in the south-eastern United States.
The straps 25 to 100 mm are locally responsible for dangerous evaporation, loss of the foot and possible soils on the island.
Strong tropical moisture causes the villages to be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwestern United States, especially most Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of sand is expected.
In the event of a rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the diverse behaviour of tropical rainwater, the wave floods may arise.
In view of the danger of tropical conflicts, it would be very unwise to go out into the desert.
A strong rain can cause the cannons to become hot rivers, and storms bring local winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure bridge brings strong local forces to some parts of southern California.
A total thickness of more than 13 mm can be obtained, which could cause less loss of sutin and clumsy vehicles.
It will be the first battle of the rain season in this region.
On Sunday evenings and on Monday mornings, they begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings the rain spread.
In the afternoon, a strong rain will spread into the four corners and will last until the middle.
In October we can expect an intensive change of temperature throughout the United States, because the Arctic will begin to sink, but the tropical sand will still be full of heat.
This sometimes leads to a sudden temperature change in short distances.
A great example of outstanding temperature differences is in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowé are approximately 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, he will again try to expand his breathing temperature.
In most central and eastern parts of the United States, warm beginnings are expected to begin with temperatures around 27 °C from south-eastern America.
In New York City it could be 27 °C, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of the year the high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States.
Britta Kavanaugh's score was more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people were watching on six television channels a fourth-party appeal to the judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Fordová, who accused him of sexual assault, which occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political path situation continued and the voters interrupted the regular programmes with reports of a sudden return: the agreement concluded by the senator for Arizona Jeff Flake that the FBI is conducting a single investigation of the charges.
Christine Ford told the court board that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh kept her at the high school party and tried to wear her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in his statement that he was 100% sure he didn't.
It is likely that the event was followed by more than 20.4 million people who are reporting to the Nielsen Agency.
The company calculated average monitoring at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that reported, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the people who are looking at the offices.
For comparison, it's a similar number of girls watching football games in play-off or sharing Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the largest monitoring in all stations when, according to the Nielsen agency, it was monitored during the entire day's hearing by 5.69 million people.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million wigs.
Nielsen notes that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
He was interested in keeping up after the meeting.
The main stage of the fifth drama was Senator Flake.
After the announcement was made by the office of this peaceful Republican that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras were arrested on Friday morning by protestors when they decided to proceed to the hearing of the judicial committee.
CNN lived his life as a couple of minutes before he became blind and gave up.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are weak.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before closing the door, he added that he would say more to the Commission's meeting.
All cables and television networks were posted alive later when the Court of Justice had to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh for the entire session.
But Flake said he would only do so if the prosecution against the candidate was investigating the FBI next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by the conversations with his friend, democratic senator Chris Cosen.
After talking to Cossen and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Mayova accused the critics of being "politors" with regard to Brexit
The Ministerial President Theresa Mayov, in his discussion on Sunday Times, accused the criticisms of his plan to leave the European Union, that "politors" about the future of Britain and are covering national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa Mayova will come to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another discussion, which was close to the Prime Minister on the title page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson opposed her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose one another is "simply unreasonable".
Shooting on Waydea Simse: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being killed by the LSU player
Police arrested suspect in the case of Wayde Simse shooting, 20-year-old LSU player.
The baton Rouge police department indicated that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of a second-stage murder charge.
The authorities published video with the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his mind at the back of the bridge.
According to the WABF channel belonging to the CBS, the police took care of the bridge on the ground and found Simpson's DNA.
Simpson, according to the police after hearing, admitted that Wayde was shot.
According to the appellant, the prison was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the Colonel's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head and church injury.
The department thanks the police unit for the attacks of the state of Louisiana, the criminal laboratories of the state police, the Southern University police and the local citizens for the investigation that led to the arrest.
Sports director LSU Joe Alleva thanked local police for “the drinking and the pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
Two-foot shooters grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points for the game.
The basketball coach, LSU Will Wade, said on Friday morning that Wayde's death was "recorded" by the team and "shaking" him.
"This is what you're still afraid of," said Wade.
Sopka dalle populos in Mexico City
The village that comes from the village of Popacatepetl, covered the south quarter of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention in Saturday warned Mexico not to approach itself, after the activity of the volcano increased and 183 emissions and floods were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was following a series of burnings and explosions.
On social networks, images of main cars covered by a kind of pool have been shown in some fourth Mexican City, such as Xochimilico.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the soybeans, which is 72 kilometers (45 miles) south of the main city. The last earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017 and had a force of 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on independence, the police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting independence with the order police and thousands of people joined the competition demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence, which was split by Catalan.
The order police blocked a group of masked separatists who followed them with a wet and sandy color, which created a dark cloud of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Later, there was also an explosion of the pipes to which the police had to use the blankets.
Supporting independence groups sang "We don't forget, we won't let go" faces in the face of protesting Union supporters calling "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people were injured in protests.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate, remains the pressure in the region that continues to grow in independence.
The majority expressed concern for independence, but the participation in the elections was low, as the resistance fighters fought against them.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations throughout the region.
Supporting independent groups stayed on Friday night outside to prevent demonstrations on support from the national police.
The demonstration went through, but she had to choose another route.
Eightteen-year-old electric Narcis Termes, who participated with his wife in a separatist protest, said that he no longer hopes in the prospects of gaining independence for Catalan.
"Lonni lived one of the best moments.
My parents were happy that they could vote, but now we're in the dark street," he said.
Despite the important fact that a close victory in regional elections has been held in the Italian side of the struggle for independence in order to keep things going this year. Many of their most prominent leaders have either gone to exile themselves or wait in court for their participation in the referendum organisation and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old Mount Joan Puig plays a protest in support of the police on his phone and says that the conflict has resolved politics on both sides.
"The situation is getting worse," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for a trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that the next year will be running to the European Parliament.
"Candidatura in European elections is the best way to judge the impact of democratic values and repressions that we are witnesses to the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crash at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were imprisoned after being repatriated into a home in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 a.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was a damage to the defense and the home itself.
In one moment, maybe someone shot the car out of the kitchen.
Mengo's move ensured Livingston's victory 1-0 on Rangers
First head of Dolly Mengy for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston, who came from a lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerard a second break of 18 plays in the role of Ibrox's club manager.
Trefa Dolly Mengy showed up to be critical when Gary Holt's team got to the Hibernian second place.
Gerrard's team still has no premiership victory in the guest garden and next week will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
In the meantime, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston has expanded a series of non-smokers in the division for six rounds, so the chief coach Holt, who shot Kenny Miller last month, hasn't tried to do it yet.
Livingston didn't take advantage of the chance against non-explained guests.
Holt's team had to take a long time ahead of the floor because his directness caused many problems.
Scott Robinson crossed the defense, but before the defense he failed, then Alan Lithgow in the club just quietly passed Craig Halketta's head before the branch.
The housekeeper was able to watch the Rangers play before them because he knew that the guests could handle the standard situations.
And so came the key head.
In contrast to Rangers, a free cup was set up and Livingston created a sleigh, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Meng together, which the sword in the middle of the camp area ran and repaired.
At this stage Rangers dominated the holding of the sword, but domestic defenses for them were inevitable and the banker Liam Kelly had much work.
The same picture of the game was also during the second season, even when Alfredo Morelos took Kelly to the funeral.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers Allana McGregor and Lithgow from another standard situation in Livingston.
In the immediate vicinity of Livingston, there are still airports where players have regularly circled around, and there are also two criminal copies – after Halket's attack on Glenna Midleton's backyard and the other hand.
"Fenomen" from Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Without exception, they were exceptional and on their way up and continue to overcome expectations.
Their style of games and men haven't changed since they came back to spy, but great honor awaits Holt for how he's been excommunicated since his arrival.
He had so many roots.
Captain Halkett was huge, led by a highly organized defense, while Menga maintained for a long time in the preparation of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrella.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerard, but these standards don't work out.
Their finals were a chaba – only once they went to the home page – and for Rangers it should be a building because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan expected a mixed arrival in Colin
When Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (September 29th) for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all smiles themselves.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim is to establish relations between NATO associations.
They have not agreed on a number of human rights issues, including freedom of the press and the adoption of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Colina, where he opened a huge new museum.
This city is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police for security reasons prevented 25,000 people from meeting in front of the museum, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people — many of them Kurds — were protesting against Erdogan who rejected his policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Controversial protests reflect the controversy of a visitor to whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero and others cursed as an autocrat.
Error in Deptford: Cyclist died after the blast
In London, he died of a cyclist after fighting with a dog.
The accident occurred about 10:15 at the local time near the Bestwood Street cruiser with the Russian Evelyn Street in Deptford on the south side of the city.
The driver stopped the car and soon came to the hospital, but the man was dead.
A few months after the death of another cyclist, about a mile away, half of a Saturday tragedy occurred at the Children's Street accident when the driver took off.
The Metropolitan Police indicated that the police are now trying to identify and inform the police of his presence.
The train is closed, buses run after repair tracks and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin binding: Six suspects were injured in non-smokers
According to the prison office, six suspects were injured in men's prisons with high fear.
The rooms broke out in Long Larsin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday about 9:30 a.m., and they still stay.
In order to manage the resistance to which eight prisoners joined in one race, specializing observers from the "Tornado" team were allowed.
The suspects suffered a slight injury and were healed on the spot.
Speaking prison services said: “To manage the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, special training of prison workers was found.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
In our prisons we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that those responsible for it will be sent to the police and can spend more time on the networks."
In Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous dealers in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager had ended up in prison in the hospital after an attack.
And in October, the guards were allowed to enter the prison because of serious disturbances in which the staff was attacked by bullets.
Hurikán Rosa threatens the natives of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is not unusual for Arizona to enter a tropical bridge of low pressure, but this is likely to occur at the beginning of the next week when the remaining energy of the Rosa volcano passes through the desert south and brings the risk of attracting floods.
The National Metrological Service has already issued a warning against the floods on the south and west of the West Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, South California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will get out on the road to Phoenix in the morning, and on the afternoon evening she will bring the rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “from 1950 only 10 tropical cycles were kept at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix’s tropical storm or pressure level!
Katrina (1967) was another 64 km away from Arizona's border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Horikas are 50 to 100 mm wars, in the area of Mogollon Rome in Arizona, up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert north-west, including the middle of the Skalisty Mountains and the Great Wall, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local ceilings up to 100 mm.
For those who don't threaten the coastal waters, Rosy's rain can be a blessing, because the area's frozen dry.
The floods are very serious, but these conflicts may help, because the southwestern United States is just shady.
Server weather.com claims that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor service, Arizona consumes more than 40% at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
Rosa's first trip to the island of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still on the force of the hurricane with maximum wind speed 137 km/h, then on Sunday it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and move 19 km/h north.
Then the storm encounters the coldest waters of the Pacific, and then it loses its power.
It is expected that Mexico will arrive in the afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the forces will be strong, representing a great risk of floods.
"In the area of Baja California after the north-west Sonor, total loads of 75 to 150 mm are expected, with a possible output of up to 250 mm," the server says weather.com.
Rosa then rides like a tropical storm across Mexico north, and in the morning she arrives at the Arizona border. Then she goes through Arizona and in the afternoon she enters south Utah.
"It is expected that the main risk of Rosy or its remnants will be very strong in the Baja California, the northwestern Sonor and the east coast of the United States," the National Centre for Huricans reports.
These taxes are expected to cause fatally dangerous evaporation and loss of sutin in deserts and droughts of soil in the hot ground.
Flight to Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three kidnappings of boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested because of suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stabilized".
As reported by the police from Avon and Somerset. Young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained in the Radstock area at night.
The police are looking for witnesses who might have on the phone a record of what happened.
The trumpet says that Kavanaugh has "exceeded injustice and behaviour" Democratic parties
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugha is a rejection of the invisible and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
The Tempp stated that during the process of his nominations, Kavanaugh "has tried injustice and behaviour" democratic parties.
Kavanaugh spoke on Thursday before Congress, where he strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's call that she had been sexually assaulted several decades ago when she was a teenager.
She also told Ford about her accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “the American witnesses of Kavanaugh were the great and the qualities and qualities of the people.”
The representative of his representatives from West Virginia said that “the vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains in our time, a lawyer who has an outstanding public service account”.
The President did not immediately appeal to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to take part in a half-time election.
"Five weeks ago one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm still moving," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The Tempp stated that the Democrats decided to "response and ban".
The Executive Director of the Republican Party told CNN Station that the first key procedural vote on the Kavanaugh nomination on the basis of the session was expected at the latest on Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to grow
The authorities announced on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi had suffered extensive earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people had come to life, many of which had caused massive waves that had flooded the beaches.
On the beach in the city of Palu, they met on Friday at a festival of hundreds of people. At the end of the summer, there were up to six and a half feet [6 m] of waves that killed many people and destroyed everything they had left on their way.
A 7.5 degree earthquake caused the tsunami.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, the people continued in action on the beach and immediately did not run away, so they fell to the victim," said the Indonesian Agency for the BNPB Summit Sutopo Purwo Nugro on briffin in Jakart.
"Volna Tsunami didn't go alone, she took her car, clothes, homes, she put everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that the wave of Tsunami on the open sea spread at 800 km/h.
He indicated that some people fled to the trees before the flood and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The flight photos published by the agency for the repair of the bridge show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges and a mixture of water covered.
The results were severed in the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) indicated that the energy released by the flagship forces was about 200 times higher than the power of the nuclear bombs imposed by the second world war on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, hard tax, which could even increase the flow of Tsunami.
Nugroh described the damage as "excessive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found locked under the roofs of closed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damages could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donghea, which is close to the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, the communication was "only protected without any information" from Donghy.
In his statement, the Red Cross indicated that more than 300,000 people live in the area and added that his workers and volunteers are targeted at the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could still get a lot worse," says the statement.
The agency expected significant criticism on Saturday, because it did not inform the authorities that Palu was in possession of empty tanks, even though the authorities indicated that the wolves had arrived at the time when the warning was issued.
At the amateur summits of social media, it is to hear how a man in the upper room of the building protects people on the street from the nearby tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the coast will be covered by a water wall that carries buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was not able to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and volcanic tsunami caused a major electrical accident that had interrupted communication around Palu, so the authorities could coordinate only very difficult rescue work.
According to the military authorities, they started sending expensive aircraft from Jakarty and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of aid and remained closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo should visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Saturday.
The number of victims of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to over 800.
That's very bad.
When workers from the World Vision organization from Donghy came to the city of Paul, where the employees were hiding in the ruins of all the office buildings built on the road, Mr. Doseb said.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's very bad.
When relief groups stopped the relief work during disasters, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not to come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, resources and staff from abroad may begin to pass on to the capital city until a declared zone of national disasters is declared.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," says Indonesian Red Cross's spokesman Auli Ariani.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start international aid, but there is still no such situation."
When Paul arrived the second night after the fifth earthquake and tsunamis, friends and neighbors who were still unaware of it, they still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that bring relief to the stories of natural disasters.
They left the little boy's canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman who was imprisoned for two days at the expense of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, a trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists in the Asian game that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people in Roa Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Manginga, were his students.
"As a person who has been paralyzed for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon looked like hours after the paragliding community learned about the hotel's arrival, hoping to send a message to whatsApp contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, was replaced by two dark silences that ended with a seating sign.
"I think it means that the reports have not been delivered," he says.
The thieves took $26,750 while adding the banknote to Newport on the Levee
According to a press report by the police department in Newport, on Friday morning a total of $26,750 was awarded to the company of Brink in addition to a banknote in Newport on the Levee.
As Dr. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver offered to the bankers in a fun complex and prepared to put more money into it.
When he did that, another man "run outside the company's employee Brink" and stole a wallet with money that should be put into the bank.
A number of suspects from the area, according to the press report, were found, but the police did not stop the number of people involved in the incident.
For any information about the identity of suspects, please contact the police in Newport on numbers 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West has a name – on Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The change is formally known as Kanye West."
One-hundred-year-old West has had a vision of Ye for some time and a pseudonym to use as the name of its eight-year-old album, which went out in June.
The change comes before his release in the Saturn Day Night Live series, where he should introduce his new Yandhi album.
In the show, the singer Arian Grande, who withdrew his participation from "study reasons", as the series's outline showed.
West has previously said that the word for him has nothing but a shortness of professional name and religious meaning.
“In my view, ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, where it means ‘ty’,’” West was allowed to hear the beginning of the year when he spoke about his album with the release moderator Big Boye.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's changed from Kane, which means the only one, only Ye – as a reflection of our good, our evil, our vengeance, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
The name has also changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he gave priority to the names Love and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West's associate, JAY-Z, also wrote with and without him and large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the close 50th anniversary of the bloodshed against the students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador asserted that he never used military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza promised that "he will never use the army to attack a Mexican people."
During the time that a left student gang spread throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 began shooting people at a peaceful demonstration at the site and killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador agreed to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity to train young people will lead to criminal gangs.
USA should double funding artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the art intelligence Kai-Fu Leee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is still more active in the field of art intelligence (AI) and the USA should double the amount that they manage to research in this area.
The comment comes after the various parts of the U.S. governments have published notifications about AI, although the United States does not have any formal intelligence strategy as a whole.
In the meantime, China has set up a plan to be a unit in innovative AI by 2030.
"The double budget for the AI research would be a good start since all other countries are more than the US and we are looking for another half of the AI," says Lee.
In his discussion with the CBC this week, Lee indicated that double funding could double the chances that the next major exhibition in the AI area will be held in the United States.
Lee, who released this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in his book "Supervelmoci AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order", is the director-general of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, Face+.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on the AI system that defeated the best American player in the Othello game, and later he was the leading researcher of Microsoft and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee assessed previous US government technological competitions, such as the robotic challenge agency Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when else to help identify new visioners.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic spies don't take China, but corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technological companies have been the best professionals at the university in recent years to work on art intelligence.
In order to improve efforts in the AI area, assistance and changes in immigration policy could also be made by the United States of America.
"I think that doctors in the AI area should be automatically offered green cards," he says.
The state Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of Art of the New Generation in June 2017.
China's National Sciences Award provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way, such as the National Science Council and other government organizations spend money on researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is higher in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Department of Defence established the Joint Centre for Skills, which should involve partners from the sector and from the academic environment, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee of Elections for Skills.
And the DARPA agency announced this month that it invests 2 billion USD to initiatives called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF award, this AI now invests more than $100 million annually.
The entire U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission for Art of Intelligence has not done anything for a few months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum if they want to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in the referendum on Sunday on whether the name of the country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve several decades of old conflict with Greece, which blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents a threat to its territory, and therefore it has pledged its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition insists that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that there would be no vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for the vote raised the question whether 50 per cent of the vote would be required to make the referendum payable.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece?"
The authors of the change of name, including the president of the government of Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is the price that Macedonia, one of the representatives of the former Yugoslavia, could enter the EU and NATO organisation.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it is a more secure life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
The Network referendum was not binding, but enough Members said they would be led by the vote.
The change in the name would require a majority of the two-party majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission indicated that no problems were reported until 13 hours.
The voluntary participation was only 16 per cent to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters finally withdrew their vote.
"I've gone to love my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are voting in the Macedonian referendum on a change of name which would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumcia, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and sets out seats before the status of the people who fight the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head-down, not door for service," Kavadarkov says.
“We are poor countries, but we have our pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to another, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Association."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO Member State will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of 20%, to the extent necessary.
"I think the great majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The result of the "an" would be "assured of our future".
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, the referendum could be attended between 30 and 43 per cent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
Another study, organized by the Macedonian Telma TV station, found that on Sunday 57 per cent of respondents were willing to vote.
70 percent of them said they'd like to.
To make a referendum successful, 50 per cent plus one voter must be involved.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first major morning of the Western Government's policy since its accession to London in May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came to the head through the entire block of Brighton.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling built the Bridgeton defense on Saturday, thus ensuring Manchester City's 2-0 prize at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In giving Aguera his head seemed funny in 65 minutes.
It all started with the recording that the Argentina attacker got in the middle of the field.
He spread between the three bright ones and reached the open space.
Aguera then wore four green shirts.
On the edge of Brighton's backyard, he had one round and a few more forwards.
He found Sterling's next match on the left.
The British attacker attacked a sword in the back of Aguero, who, by virtue of his right hand, had shot Brighton Mathewa Ryan on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has foot problems," announced the reporters of the City Pep Guardiola.
"We said it would be 55 or 60 minutes.
That's right.
We were happy that he gave the gorilla at the moment."
The initial benefit for Sky Blues in this premier League, but Sterling organized it.
This hill fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a sword deep on Brighton's territory.
On the left, he sent a beautiful sword to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the sword and then sent Sterling to the remote section.
The Sky Blues racer locked a sword into the network quietly before he jumped out of the garden.
The city will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffneheim in a team of Master Leagues at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were ordered out of the game-off, there were no more reasons to repeat.
But ever-competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be placed as a cheerleader against Colorado Rockies – only when they will have Rockies, who will lead in NL West on one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for play-off.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 victory cards over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
"Even if we don't play anything, we can at least start because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will probably play with the greatest effort I've ever had.
Why don't I play it?"
The Nationals have not yet declared who will start on Sunday, but it is certain to be inclined to push Scherzer into such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start. On Thursday he'd train and hang up on Sunday when he's usually free.
The right-wing Washington has 18-7 of 2,53 ERA statistics and 300 syringes in 220 2/3 variables in this season.
Trump appeared at a meeting in West Virginia.
The President did not immediately express himself to the situation around his candidate at the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to take part in a half-time election.
"In November there will be all we've done.
One of the most important choices in our lives will last five weeks.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not a candidate, but we're still moving and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You see the East, the Eastern Democratic Group, that this is happening right now.
And they're determined to take the power through any necessary means, you see the inequality, resistance.
There's one of them who's hurt that has to be transferred to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them that."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "response and ban".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying that the Democrats are "infuriated and cruel and opposed and spreading."
He mentioned the oldest member of the Senate Court Commission, democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which led to the vote on the verdict.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait, it was a really bad word of the body -- the worst of the words of the body I've ever seen."
The labyrinth page is no longer a mixed point of view.
It's not tolerant to those who express their views.
When the activists from Moment on my local side voted for my memory, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of the volunteers who have said they are not welcome – because they have rightly said their opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, did something similar because she firmly set up antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, and the paradoxes similar to those that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In the announcement of a five-year-old labyrinth meeting in Nottingham East, it was written that "we want meetings to be accessible and productive."
For most of those eight years, which I was a local member of Parliament on a labyrinth, the GC meetings were exactly like this on Friday night.
Today, most of them are unsatisfied, and the word “swifter, more visible” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started with it.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views do not tolerate in the labyrinth and any opinion is considered acceptable for the guidance of the party.
It began soon after I became Jeremy, and colleagues whom I had previously thought we had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180° and I will stop positions that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it is national security or the single EU market.
Whenever I talk to the public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then follows the pressure on social networks, where they call for my call, withdraw the policy of the middle, and tell me that I shouldn't be in the lab.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that measure up to me are usually political.
I have respect for the professional and decision-making of my colleagues, who wear a suit of systolic or racist impressions every day, but it never gets in.
One of the aspects of this era of politics, which I am most vulnerable, is how the pressures become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Laborist Party should pursue a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in this fragmented opinion and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I've been working so many times to keep myself back, so I don't call myself, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I entered the Labourist Party 32 years ago as a teacher of the school, a failure of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who had allowed my class of general schools to fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most — whether as local worker or government minister.
I've never been hiding my policy, even in the last calls.
No one in Nottingham East could ever be surprised by my political positions and the areas in which I disagree with the ongoing leadership.
Those who supported the proposal on Friday only say that when the country sells to Brexit, which is harmful to households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the urge to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the labor force of the Laborist Party.
My main report is not a moment in Nottingham, but to my voters whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of calling or political pragmatism does not make me do what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undiscovered Ayr stands on top
Two late Fridays drew a little closer to the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned himself in this amazing fun game of Tennt's Premiership triumph.
Now they're in the front of the table, like the only non-expression.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the chance that helped the home to win, and Uncle Peter Murchie had the right to be at peace.
"In our steps we have passed great trials and we are still not disappointed, so I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "All honor to Ayru, the chances were better than us."
Grant Anderson's fifth, in 14 minutes, changed by Frazier climate, sent Ayr a coupon, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who released the Warriors for the game, enabled Melrose to use the initial transfer and Jason Baggott received an unchanged Friday.
The climate increased the management of Ayru penalto and then in the half, he repaired and changed the solar test, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half good and Patrick Anderson's five, changed Baggot, reduced the direction on five points.
Then there was further detention because of the serious injury of Ruaridha Knotta, who left the house on the boots, and when he started playing again, Ayr again jumped down thanks to the five Stafford McDowalla, who changed climate.
The deputy Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose used the players again, thanks to the unchanged five Bruce Colvina after a short strong pressure.
Homers also returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow for the attack on Climate without a sword, MacPherson of the Pentalary Series put the sword behind the moving small Ayre.
He changed the climate, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught the head of David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's lap for five domestics.
Still Game Star is starting a new career in hospitality
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series appears to be moving into the host camp. It has been found to be appointed by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
Sixteen-year-old Jack Jarvise plays in a popular BBC series that he writes and plays with a long-term comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming nine series would be the last series of series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Crailonggo.
According to an official register, the director of the Adymorn Limited company is the director.
Herec refused to comment, but the source of the Scottish Sun debt indicated that Kiernan wants to join the "progressive business in restaurants" in Glasgov.
"The sea is ours": inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are watching the seamanship in La Paz, which is decorated with lano.
On public buildings, the blue train rides into the ocean.
The seabeds of the Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described as: “It is our right.
Finding him is our duty."
Throughout the interior of Bolivia, there is still a living memory on the coast that has lost the country in the favor of Chile in the 19th century's blood war on the source – just as it is the tide to rewind the Pacific.
These trends may be the largest in a few decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice which should expire on 1 October after five years of imprisonment.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and calm and of course expects a positive outcome," says the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD decisions on large screens across the country with the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that, after decades of closed talks, Chile is obliged to agree that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
The Charismatic Homeland President, Bolivia Evo Morales, who has before him a controversial fight for the renewal of the next year, is also of great interest in the southern decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This UN body, sitting in the Netherlands, has no power to adapt to any Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the last arguments have been made shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, the Chilean expert on international law.
And in the last four years, not only did Bolivia not support it, but it may have been worse than it was.
"The question of access to the sea has been strengthened by the coming disease government," Zárate says.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all remaining good for Chile.
Bolívies and Chile once again start to reunite, but after this it will be extremely difficult to get a discussion.
Both countries have not changed their views since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in Haagu, rejected the view that the decision of the court was not usually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance "end of 139 years is inconceivable with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political barrier.
"Bolivia never seems to have the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we have to deal with the past."
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear disarmament unless it can't trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people never fight their nuclear weapons as first, if they can't trust Washington
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN Assembly Hall.
He called on the United States to carry out the pledges of the leaders of the two rivers in Singapore.
His comment is coming after what seems to be the US foreign minister Mike Pompeo is trying to restart the nuclear diplomacy that took place on the dead spot, more than three months for the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "planout they hope" that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S. intention against the declaration of the end of the Korean war could sometimes strike the North on the knees.
Washington is careful about the agreement with the declaration, if Pchjongjang does not first make excellent steps to defend himself.
Kim and president of the USA Donald Trump want another sum.
It also points to general scepticism that Pchjongjang is seriously thinking that he will give up this arsenal, which the country will probably see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjungjang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Reviews show that in your fashion trades, the latest trend of head coverings is soon
If you want to expand your collection of clowns or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The rapporteurs Valentino and Thom Browne published a series of broken head coverings for their collection of jaro/year 2019 to the viewers who had captured everyone at the Paris Week.
A lot of non-practicable clowns flew into Instagram this summer and these designers sent their rising creatures to the ground.
Valentina's opening shirt was removed from the sandstone with a wide-eyed cap that covered the head of the model.
Other extremely large supplements were decorated with melancholy, magical clasps and even ananas – but are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also presented the selection of foreign masks – and just at Halloween.
Many of the pessowing masks have the protection of the fingers and remember more Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One was reminded of the underground equipment and with the snorch and glasses, while the other looked like a cornet with a broken smell.
And if you're able to continue in the right way, you're lucky.
Modular experts predict that large-scale chips could also be reached in fashion trades.
The growing clasps come after "La Bomba", a sleek with half a meter wide cramp that all brought from Rihanny to Emily Rattakowski.
The cultural symbol behind this very ineffective block of social media was sent to a visual blue of another size – a fragile beach bag, which is almost as big as a model in the clouds that carry it.
The dark orange Rafi bag, removed by raffic trimmings and made of white leather, was at the Parisian week with the exhibition taste collection La Riviera jaro/year 2019 from Jacquemuse.
Celebrateist Luke Armitage told the F.D.: “I expect large ships and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next year – given the success of a designer with them, it would only be difficult to ignore the demand for too large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic achievements, and this also continues with other excellent results in 2018. Individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community activities only supports this.
These schools have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools and strives to ensure that their students and parents are the best level of service.
Independent schools prepare their claims for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place among global citizens.
As the education sector that can propose and implement individually adapted educational plans, we note that modern languages are still popular and applied in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, that’s right in his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it's going to his heart."
It is an important step that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of the annual trials show that languages are at the top of the table, while higher levels of success have independent schools.
About 68 percent of the people who learned foreign languages achieved the best sign A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools indicate that the highest score A reached 72% of Mandarins, 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will need in the future without doubt.
Languages such as subjects that love themselves are in the study plans of independent schools as well as other subjects of STEM (knowledge, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that for the reasons that employees pose problems in the area of free places, 17 per cent of their language skills are insufficient.
Therefore, language skills continue to become increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Given that more and more labour opportunities require languages, these skills are in a globalized world of necessity.
If a person chooses any career, if he learns another language, he will have in the future the real benefit of having such a lifelong experience.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly to people from foreign countries, people are getting more and more languages automatically benefit from competition.
According to a study conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language sufficiently well so that they could have a conversation, with the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage of people, in particular 15%, French.
It is therefore important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially those of developing economies, they will have a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school suffers from the language it learns.
The class is focusing on more classical modern languages, while others are learning languages that are considered the most important for Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
If the child is already interested in anything, he will always have independent schools to choose from a number of languages with students who are in a given field of experts.
Scottish independent schools are committed to ensuring the educational environment that children prepare and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what they are waiting for in the future.
At this point, it cannot be said that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will be young people in Scotland and will continue to offer this choice, diversity and significance.
You have to do it.

LeBron will be the first to introduce himself on Sunday in San Diego in Lakers.
Faños who are happy when LeBron James first arrives for Los Angeles Lakers, they'll be waiting soon.
Lord Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday initial session held in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's still not clear how many minutes she's playing.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James probably only plays a limited number of minutes.
Last week after the train, James asked for his plans for six Lakers' games in the pre-session.
"In this phase of my career, I do not need pre-session sessions," he said.
Drumpo's release in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts the campaign tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia.
It's the first of five minutes scheduled for the next week, including a stay at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the approval of his candidate for a position allowed in the Supreme Court, Trump wishes to receive support for pending elections in half of the mandate, as the Republicans are in the elections in November before the risk of the loss of Congress.
How many hours does Trumpo start tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trompo Assembly in Weiling, West Virginia, is planned at 19:00 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's myth in West Virginia you can watch online below by means of live transfer to YouTube.
The trumpet will probably talk about hearing a candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, who spent this week and was very excited because of the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct. It is expected that the signing of the Senate's vote will be suspended for one week than the trial of the FBI.
But the main aim of this wave of myths is to help the Republicans to step up the elections in November.
According to the Reuters campaign organizers, President Trupa says that these five meetings next week are aimed at "adding the energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority of those in the Senate and the Snow Representative".
"The control over the Senate is so important to his agency that the president will take the campaign to the largest number of states in this Russian season," said Agent Reuters, the spokesman of the Trump campaign, who did not want to be named.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohia and Pensylvania" could come from Pittsburgh on the spot at Wesbanco Aren in Wheeling today.
It will be on Saturday in the last month, which Trump will visit West Virginia, where he received more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is staying in research.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president must come to help him in his studies," says the agency Reuters Politologist at the University of Zapadovirgin.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed that he has to fight hunger to keep hope in front of Sundays alone
After three single shots, the Saturday couple can be just what Ryder Cup needed.
It's a very well-designed sport concept, but the player really believes it, and most of all, it's just on such competitions.
So where's the cell now?
"They knew about six points and now they're four, so we're taking it so it's probably moving a little bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a benefit, it has four points and still remains twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in the beaches, and there are many things that can awaken them, for example the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played all day together and each can enjoy three points from four.
Spieth was dying when he moved from the ground floor to the ground and went for example.
The famous screams still moved on in the continuation of his car when he mastered the key pad to get the whole game when they were with Thomas on two backs.
His path, which won the game for 15 jams, met with a similar tree that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and watch your own game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left.
18 legs to stop the foot.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a story of Ryder cup.
It's wonderful, but the lovely two of Europe's four are four and nothing's wrong.
"Molywood" was the only couple who spent the afternoon non-refilling of the jacket on Saturday, but last Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
This experience and the way the energy passes through as a guide to the angry audience, thus confirming that these are players' destinations to the non-industrial victory, and that in the west of the sun over Le Golf National will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best two are on a different corner.
However, the words about the European glory remain early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly worked with Sergey García, a hearty early game with four cats when he was played with Alex Noren.
James and two of them buried Spain and Sweden in the ruins of which they had not escaped.
But on Sunday no one can help you.
Two games on two games are so fascinating when you closely monitor the interaction of people in pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe played better than the team, and until the last day, it took a great leap, but this game two also showed that the U.S. team had a hunger for war, which some, especially from the states, doubted.
By the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe to 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy benefit by the last day of Ryder Cup after the two Saturdays on two games with a 10-6 jump over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won at least twice over the saved Tiger Woods, decided to make four shots in Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided to keep the trophies that were lost in Hazeltin, dominated in the early games on two games with American side, which took place in series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, two matches won, but they couldn't get to the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 Sundays to leave the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European novel that wins four points behind it, while he and Molinari, who have won the "Molliwood" victory after the weekend, are the first pair to win four points from their four original games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After losing the players Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two games and then the cold defeated the famous Woods and American novelty Bryson Dechambeau even more worthy of 57-4.
Woods, who fought two games on Saturday, showed a temporary blizzard, but now he played 19 of his 29 games in the game two to two games and seven to row.
Justin Rose, from the early game on two games, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson in the game two times for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky - one and three times in the world's puzzle.
Europe, however, did not have it in this pleasant fresh day in the southwestern part of Paris.
The three-year-old chief winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas lost for the Americans on Saturday two points.
They won a strong 2&1 victory over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game on two games and returned later defeating the two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of two, although the first two jacks lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup is the team returning from the four-year deficit to the double, although as a determinant Furryk's party needs only a limit to the triumph.
After the second day was the best for two days, it seems to be a minor opposition to them.
North Korea says they don't fight "in no case" alone and with no confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued sanctions of the UN would deepen their distrust of the United States and, under such circumstances, the country would never take up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said in his annual plenary meeting that in recent years North Korea has adopted “a significant measure of good will”, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the demolition of nuclear testing sites and promises that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not be spread.
"But we do not see the corresponding reactions from the USA," he said.
"With no confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not possible to stand alone."
While Ri repacked the known North Korean difficulties with regard to Washington's resistance to the “progressive” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for any step forward, its declaration became significant in that it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization only because it had already passed in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the American President and the North Korean leadership in Singapore on 12 June when Kim engaged in the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump attached security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea forces a formal end to the war between 1950 and 53, but the United States said that Pchjongjang must first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington also called for the release of strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US maintains the ‘first denuclearization’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives, and they even resort to ‘the declaration of the end of the war’," Ri said.
"I believe that sanctions can bring us to the knees, there are people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings of Kima and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If, on the other hand, the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such a bad situation."
However, the tone of Riho's appearance was dramaticly different from that of the Dutch when he told the U.S. General Assembly that the target of the North Korean rocket on the US territory was inevitable after the "spoiled President" Trump marked Kim for "racet's husband" on a suicide mission.
This year in the OSN Trump, which threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea in the last year, commended Kim for his willingness to take steps to defend, but said that much work must still be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
In the middle of Trump said that there is no time frame, he said: “If it lasts two years, three or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should award Pchjungjang for measures taken.
Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in its entirety and without delay until we are aware of the complete, final, verified denuclearization"
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in its efforts to finance nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Pchjongjang.
Pompeo and Ri met at a wave gathering on the UN side, and Pompeo announced that the next month he will visit Pchjungjang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't end well.
He left Pchjungjang in July and announced that progress had been made only to be made in North Korea for several hours to declare him "gangster requirements".
In this month, North Korea committed itself to meeting with Moon to demolify the rocket area and also a nuclear complex, if the United States takes "relevant measures".
He noted that Kim informed him that "responsive measures", in which he hoped, are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalising relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard are at a participating course to learn enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year enabled all its students to get more sleep, and it is in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studios all night when students don't sleep and wake up with caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world's most obedient university are often unhappy when it comes to taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital, which is thought to be his first type in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after what he presented about the impact of sleep depression on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why do you tell me this first, in my last year?'
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he pointed out for The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, gives students basic information on how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall performance.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university's medical services, said that the university decided to take a course after ensuring that students were really not exposed during the week.
The clock course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there are students' bicycles, where students click on coffee, soap, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how the athletic performance is affected by the lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In other parts, participants are informed how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of infarction, death, depression and cancer.
A map of the campaign with interactive icons then shows participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the conduct of the students will not change immediately.
However, we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of “study all night” continues to exist, adding that modern technologies and still growing pressure on students mean that there is a growing problem with sleeplessness.
The amount of sleep for good quality should be a "slow weapon" student for fighting stress, fatigue and fatigue, he said - even so that it doesn't come to the collection, because sleep depression stops the brain into the cooling system, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to propose a course that was completed during his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press on the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
The professor recommended that students consider the setting of the alarm at the time they go to bed as soon as they wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "moderate light" of electronic images and LED lighting that can spread your circadian rhythm, which leads to bleeding problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga Skip Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when Dr. Dolly Mengy identified Steven Gerrard's discomfort with a 1-0 stroke in Livingstone.
Ibrox's side was trying to record his first victory from 4th to 1st century triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team made only second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from previous leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago, and the Rangers team seemed to solve it without inspiration and determination.
While Rangers now hangs in the sixth place, Livingston jumps on the third and right after the Hibernian team on the same branch.
And it could come to other problems Rangers after what the black resolver Calum Spence had to be healed with his head wound after he was apparently incapacitated by an object from the mirror.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which moved around Ayr to semi-final Bethfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who had collected the Hearts item last week and had the joy of seeing his well-trained husband breathe his opposition every step.
Rangers may have controlled detention, but Livingston did more with the sword on their side.
They were supposed to take care of just two minutes after the start when Menga first let Scott Pittman in the Allan McGregor branch, but the depositary buried his great chance.
The Keaghan Jacobse, a distant free chief, then found Captain Craig Halketta, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only dig in the rear.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third, there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a pen for the fourth step when he met Steven Lawless, but decision-makers Steven Thomson made a Colombian challenge from the table.
Rangers only had two shots for the first half, but former banker Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassany Coulibaly and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in 34 minutes could have been against the game run, no one can say that they've earned it by the way.
Rangers couldn't deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent Scott's sword to Robinson, who was at ease and took Mengo to a simple end.
Gerrard picked up the action and changed the Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediately a result when the train was locked up in Morelos, but the impotence Kelly was afraid of the sword and the attack was blocked.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgov and Halkett metal one long sword behind another.
Holt's side could have broken through the final stages, but McGregor set himself well to block Jacobse before Litgow escaped from the desert.
Commander Rangers Glenn Middleton had another late revenge when he asked Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
German: Venetian Geiger's reader
And now a page from our German "Natural Morning": 30 September 1882, today is 136 years old, and it still comes... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter's science studio also became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, in the main role of these incredibly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is the matter with God?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s reader who is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these hearing cells, you can really hear the effects of atoms of radioactive activity in minerals.
Evans says, "Well, it's really enough now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But you find someone who doesn't call his name, he's still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system "see" dangerous tumors
A new vaccine against cancer can teach an immune system to "see" dangerous tumors and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous tumors as part of the treatment
Method includes the extraction and transformation of immune cells from patients and their transformation into laboratories
Then they can see protein that is common to many cancers and then re-inject
The experimental vaccine shows weak results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous tumors had cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from patients, their changes in the laboratory, so they can "see" proteins common in many HER2 cancers and then be re-applyed to the brain.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have developed a very weak vaccine."
HER2 “leads the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colorectal carcinoma, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immunosuppressed from patients and "learned" to focus on cancer cells was already in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West participated in a pro-trumping, in his hat, and it was after his release to the SNL.
It wasn't very good.
Kanye West was quoted in a Saturday Night Live study after a suspected appearance during which President Donald Trumpa said he would apply in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, named Ghost Town, in which he had the head of the Mike America Great Again, he started to swim on democracy and to pack his support to President Trumpa.
“I often talk to white people, and they say, ‘How can you like Trumpa, though he is a racist?’”
If I were to run racism, I wouldn't be in America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began the exhibition of parody with Matte Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star played from the witness of Bretta Kavanaugh before the Senate's court committee on calling Christine Blasey for rape.
Although it was not sent, West's theater talks were recorded on social media by the comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to laugh at West.
The West also made the wonder that he had his head back in the back of his head.
"In the backyard, I was shocked.
They said, "Don't go there with this cow."
That's a joke!
They also said I'm in the wrong place," said the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that "He'd set up his superman suit, because that means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move ahead?
Try love."
His comments were served only twice, and members of the SNL appeared angry, said the Variety, and one person even said: “The whole study was complete. ”
Westa was invited as the backbone for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West defeated many neighbors by singing a song I Love translated into Perrier's tongue.
West received support from the leading TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most important characters: DYKUYY, that you're POSITIVE DAVE."
But the host talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West "was just who he is, and that's just amazing."
"But I'm not going to hire someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "smoking"), who believes that he represents and sends him to the world of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he's now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and went to Didy's feet, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, previously named Snoop Lion and, of course, the song legend Prince, changed his name to symbol and then artists previously known as Prince.

The Trones Star Kit Harington has been released into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in violent middle-aged ghosts of the HBO series.
Herec, 31 years old, however, emerged from the stereotype of a small brain and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be assertive to serve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believes that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his star, Rose Leslie, also admitted that this problem is "very strong."
"At this moment I personally feel quite strongly - what happened to the masculinity?" he said.
"What do we learn from a man coming up with a problem we're seeing here?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the presence of toxic men through her very male status.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What does the key learn on television, on the streets, feel that every man should have his own page?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because a young man must have changed something to the worse.
He also agreed in the discussion that he would not play in any past or series of games after the series is over, because he already has a lot of "wars and horses".
From November, Kit will be playing in the renewed legal West Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the liar.
Herek recently left that meeting with his current wife, Rose, for the best of the game on the tour.
"I met my wife at the time of the series, so he gave me my future family and my whole life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of the love of Kitov's position of Jon Snow, in this fantasy of the series prized by Emmy.
A couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China indicates 14% growth in new cases
China reported 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people have been reached in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant changing the behaviour of the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who were infected with HIV in this way was reduced almost to zero, introduced Chinese doctors to a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is increasingly widespread.
In view of the conservative values of countries, studies suggest that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disabilities come from insufficient sexual protection in these stages.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has extended universal access to HIV treatment as part of the efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters writes that the staff would let go of the data of the GOP senators, increase the term "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
In Saturday, American MP Maxine Waters dismissed the claim that a member of her employees sent personal data from three Republican senators to lawmakers' websites.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charge was supported by "extremely" scientists and websites.
"A lie, a lie and another disgusting lie," said Waters in his statement on Twitter.
This information was clearly included in the addresses of home and telephone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information was published on Thursday on the Internet and published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate on charges of sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
The only information came after the three senators heard Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which is a source of contributions, is connected to the Waters Agency and has published information about the staff of Waters, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is simply an unfair and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened because of these suspicious and false charges - was not in any case responsible for the loss of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is simply an unfair and absolute lie."
Water's announcement quickly proved to be an online criticism, including that from the former press secretary of the White House of Ariof Fleischera.
"This approach is angered," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that there is no temperature for being a member of the Congress."
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get hurt.
It's not supposed to be exciting.
There's no need to question the motives of the complainant.
He has to be calm and don't get upset."
It seemed that Fleischer compared the reactions of Waters with the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who criticized him because during the fourth hearing, he seemed to be too upset.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who has participated in the campaign against Waters, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In his Waters statement, her office warned “the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings on these double orders.
"We are pleased to be friends," she continued, "that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English re-enters reviews – poor spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which seems to be the case of this Johnny English reviving in the series of action parodys - which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this tough satirate on how obviously we are a bad nation, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this accomplished, non-compliant Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack this thing in a new way - a name more than any other sign that a broad chemical design is intended for non-English speaking cinematographic audiences.
Of course he's the stupid secret agent who has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau's magic glamour, and he's got a big kiss from Mr. Bean and a big kiss of that guy who burned the only tone in the Chariots of Fire at the beginning of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
The post is also originally based on the passengers and the international secret man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten television commercials Barclaycard, who left behind chaos.
In this final issue there will be one or two beautiful moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the middle of the fire and the rotor's head soon jumped over his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is presented, but humor is quite underestimated and seemingly excessive, especially when “serious” film characters like 007 and Mission Imposible are now offering comedians as a certain product.
Humor is more like a kid than an adult, and for me, Johnny English's crazy trampodes are as sophisticated and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gays in Mr. Bean's person.
The constant current assumption is that Great Britain has serious problems.
The cybernetic hacker infiltrated the British super-thai network of spies and removed the identity of all British agents in the field, to scare an agent into service - to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last cap for the prime minister, which is a boring and busy position that is already suffering from the complete collapse of political instability: Emma Thompson's career Theresa May is playing the best, but there's nothing in the scenario.
Her rapporteurs inform her that when each active spy is threatened, she will have to return someone from work.
This means that the only Johnny English who is now employed as a director in some luxury device, but at the same time provides a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: there are a few nice gays here because English offers a Spanish Academy like School Year.
English went back to Whitehall because of the need for a visit and met with his former long-term partner, Bough, who was again playing Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the vice president, infected by the situation on which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine might even be a bit flat.
So Batman and Robin, in packing tasks for the secret services of their Majesty, are back in action and meet with the beautiful femme of Ophelia Bullet, who played by Olga Kurylenko.
The prime minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: a bad Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their dress with a full frescoy patallies: masking as a reader burns the French restaurant; creating chaos when they jump into the Voltow luxury yachts; and English throws clean anarchy when they try to get to know the virtual reality of the Volt's house.
All the es are definitely ready for this last sequence, but even if it's more nice and hotter, it's got something on the children's television.
It's quite a matter of concern.
And just like other Johnny English films, I couldn't imagine: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really corresponds to his talent?
Laborists claim to develop a plan for England to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbin's labyrinth page has to consider a radical plan in which Brits will work four days a week and will be paid five days a week.
The Party wishes that the chief companies deliver support to workers, who will benefit from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
The employees would enjoy the weekend, but they would still have the same reward.
The source claims that this opinion would "go" to the economic agenda of the party and plan to move the country to the benefit of the workers.
The four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Committees as a way for workers to make use of economies of change.
A long-term member of the laboratory pointed out for Sunday Times: “It is expected that the evaluation of this measure will be notified by the end of the year.
It won't last night, but the fourth working week is an invitation that is based on the position of the party to assess the economy in favour of the employee and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an opinion, the Green Party has joined the four-day working week during its general voluntary campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by a labyrinth as a whole.
"The four-day working week is not our party's policy and the party does not take it into account".
Stone Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to complete his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell stated that it was decided to return energy from "anonymous managers" and "signors" in utility companies.
The plans of the stage office also mean that current shareholders in water companies must not return to their full share, as the labor force could carry out "wars" on the basis of the proposed commission.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in the company’s administrative council and to create funds for own-owned holdings which allocate 10 % of their own capital to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in a series of "60 minutes", whether the FBI investigation could change their view
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh removed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the Authority's finding the office could be held by some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a discussion of Sunday's '60 minutes', Mr. Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that might change their view.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When the charges came up, I called him, and said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, unique."
However , the Graham's decision is inconceivable .
"I have already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and would mean it would really be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one: Brett did it hard," Graham added with a look at Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those whom she named, had been able to prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see anything's going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what did he do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the annual Global Citizen Festival, which offers a very efficient series of stars and the same dynamic mission at the end of the world's poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival in the seventh anniversary welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only such artists as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was announced in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the eradication of poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain free access to shares (if you were not willing to pay for VIP input), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mail to world leaders, telephones or other meaningful ways, such as helping to increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years ago before he reached his goal?
Is the idea to give people a free concert really the way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case such as "clictivism" - people who feel that signing on-line petitions or sending tweets is changing?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its representatives, trying to achieve various objectives.
It is said that these actions have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion that have to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds provided are currently having a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and realizers who committed to "help children grow to their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help with the completion of the country's subjugation after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British governments, donors, national governments and the Global Citizens, as you are, we can only make a note in the history of social injustice in the form of double-life," said the spokesman of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman's award during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also noted that, after more than 5,000 U.K. actions to improve mother and child survival, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which accounts for 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your websites with the question, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fall.
But just like a great civil law and a struggle against apartheid, we're going to succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is one of the players who will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. would be able to use the seawater for "blockade", which would prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to the sea to prevent the fall of Russian energy on the markets, including the Middle East, from leaving the US Minister inside Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's engagement in Syria - especially where it is due to the call for legitimate government - is an obstacle to examining new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to spend energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official declaration, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the opportunity to make sure that the maritime routes are open and, where necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Markets described the activities organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit group that has become a "vote energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's access to contact with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were practical.
"Economic opportunities for Iran and Russia are mainly investment in or replacement of fossil fuels," he pointed out and similarly refers to Russia as a "one-year-old" player with economic dependence on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes because the Trump administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its frozen land oil to Europe and restore Russia, which is much easier for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trompo Board, including American President Donald Trumpa himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 flight project made by Trumpa from Berlin "rujmi" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 fuel value of 11 billion dollars, which has to double the existing capacity of 110 billion square metres, is a purely economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's hot opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is, for example, by some competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure development tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting the US Minister for Energy Rick Perrym in September in Moscow.
The United States was occupied by the position of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state enters into our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises that "a close look" at the presidential candidate in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the half of the electoral period, "the near looks closer" at the candidate to the president.
During the workshop in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidate.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and perform our division of government, including high women's position," said The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll take a closer look at the presidential candidate."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that he "will lead this country in the wrong direction".
"I fear to the sea what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open to his criticism of Trump and his appointment as the highest judge, Britta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: "Of course we need an investigation by the FBI before the vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think she should apply in 2020.
Thirty-eight percent of "probably" voters from Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not apply, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidate.
The study showed increased support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent for the candidate and 48 per cent for the candidate.
Among other highly established democratic names, which were discussed in connection with the potential candidate for 2020, was former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he's gonna decide officially in January, he's taking over the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cancels PTSD Track Palina on meeting with Donald Trumpe
Track Palin, 26, spent a year on the list in September 1 year in Iraq.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"What happens to my own son, who goes on after his return, may affect other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers return with," said the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulse, Oklahoma.
Palino called this "sloan in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they return a little differently, they return to their destinations, they return and ask if there is really any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and planes, and every other member of the army, give their country.
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Vasilla in Aljašce, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, arresting a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in the police station, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police department of Vasilla.
18 States, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to the new measures of the American government, which will kill asylum victims in front of a gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the eight States and the period of Friday in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and reject this measure, the NCB stated.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which in August gave the Organization of Civil Liberties to the American People's Party against Federal Policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but the US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was kept in Texas.
Greek lawmakers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations that face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new asylum policy in the United States has given rise to the decision of the 2014 call-to-citizen meeting, which has enabled illegal immigrants to ask for asylum in front of domestic violence.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine stated in a petition saying that the new measure "is a violation of national, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be reasoned on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a breach violates this principle," said a short friend.
Lawyers further argued specifically that a policy that forbids immigrants' entry into the United States is damaging the economy and says it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "give needed jobs".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the area of immigration not to give asylum to victims who fear domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of a political opinion," the Sessions said in their report of 11 June.
Azyl never had to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Trusted rescue attempts in Palu, where the number of victims has already doubled, are running in search of survivors with time
For the rest of her life, the situation was worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who was happy with her hot boyfriend at the center of the evacuation in the city of Palu.
“Every minute the sanitizer will bring another body.
Clean water is simple."
The inhabitants were seen coming back to their destroyed homes, picking up stuff and trying to save anything they could find.
People's bodies were damaged and hospitals destroyed by earthquakes of 7.5 were protected.
Some of the injuries, including Two Haris, who suffered a stroke of patriotism and cancer, were recovered at the Paluo's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of further severe injuries.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt that violent earthquake broke into the hotel room in the fifth floor, which shared the room with his wife and daughter.
‘There is no time to save.
I think I've been stuck to the heart of the wall," Haris said for Associated Press and added that his family was in the city because of the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
They're probably all right."
A U.S. official accuses China of "scaking" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-star commercial in the US newspaper, which was committed to the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, an American journalist in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread the propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the tax paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state of the biggest sales news in Iowj - after which he accused China of trying to move to the United States Congress polls on 6 November.
The trumpeting claim that Peking tried to interfere with American elections indicated what American representatives said that the Reuters agency was a new phase of the Washington campaign to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place commercial advertising in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently late in the emerging trade war, which occurs at the level of mutual imports.
The Chinese judicial sanctions at the beginning of the war were designed to prosecute exporters in the states, such as Iowa, who supported the Republican side, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American journalist in China and former long-term Governor Iwu, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Peking injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his statement in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China now doubles this gap by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press."
"In expanding its promotions, the Chinese government uses the US's valuable tradition of free advertising and free press to place advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a news station on the streets of Beijing, you will find limited voices and you will not see any real reflection of the unsound views that China could have on the disturbing economic drive of China, since the media belongs to the company ‘Chinese Communist Party’.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish an offer" his article, even though he did not say what news.
Republikas leave their volleyballs before the elections because of the debate with Kavanaugh, protecting analysts
As many Spanish Republicans accuse the candidate of Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanaga, who is responsible for several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that during the upcoming half-life elections, they know the answer, especially from women.
Beyond this case, the emotions were extremely high and most of the Republicans on the record already say they want to proceed with the vote.
These things can't come back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said he suspects that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) will finally force the FBI's investigation to calm the voters down.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget about this tomorrow and not even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and speaking group on MoveOn, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors called "Listod is approaching!" at a meeting in which the Republicans, who are in charge of the judicial commission, decided to call Kavanaugha and pass Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, said Mic.
"Democratic overcrowdings and motivations will produce records," said Stu Rothenberg, an unusual political analysis.
"People say it's already high, it's true."
However, this could be higher, especially between women's active volunteers on the subject and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age who are not like president, but often do not go to elections."
Even before the public testimony of the Forum, in detail stating its allegations of sexual assault on the candidate of the Supreme Court of Analyticals, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, they could follow the objection.
"He has been running out of this questionable order for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, beginning last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about voting in the committee or final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh sits on the table for a century, it is also about how the Republicans ruled and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, president of the US priority, a group that helps to vote for democracy, pointed out on the press channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided into the view that they believe in the light of the Fords and the Kavanaugh witnesses, with some more sympathy for the other named.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents were either determined or likely to believe the Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent indicated that they are certain or likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent indicated that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably lying or probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a press release from Flako's FBI at the present time, he investigates charges raised by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, introduced The Guardian.
The Ford witnessed before the Senate's court hearing under oath last week that Kavanaugh was shot by a gun at her 17-year-old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her his genius during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web browser plans to start a new Internet and advance Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, discoverer World Wide Web, is starting up trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that sets up an Open Source platform of Berners-Lee company called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he pointed out that the purpose of the Inrupt project is "world government."
"We have to do it now," he said about this start.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online database" or POD.
It can include contact lists, job lists, calendars, music books and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Disc Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's on your personal online posting data is that it's entirely for users to determine who will have access to any kind of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is to provide John Bruce's general manager with resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
At present, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project, working on the project and community of volunteers.
This week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with "Facebook and Google don't talk about making a complete change where all their business models are turned up by night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In his contribution to the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that sending the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem, which will help to protect the integrity and quality of a new website based on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the discussion of the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Praise of the Spiritual Oslam that was held during World War I by Victoria Cross
The celebrations have been years since the only spiritual Church of England received the victory during the first world war of Victorian cross as a warrior.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received an evaluation on September 29, 1918 at the Bellengles and Lehaucourt attack.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never realized that he had won the highest British military rating.
His two grandsons gave him a memorial stone on Saturday at the festival in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “generally symbolic” that the stone was discovered about 100 years after his grandfather’s victory.
According to the London Magazine of September 29, 1918, Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very loud sound and a strong shot from the hands and knees."
Later, he reached the first line and led the "higher angle" line to the front line than he went to the burning field by himself and hit three separate units.
Colonel Vanna killed a German bomber on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I'd never do but something that's humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, who was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, was sentenced to prison.
Michael Vann said that "he felt a great honor that he could share with the viewer," and added that "the courage of the true heart is shown by the support that provides a lot of people."
The MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got the Peppa pig.
Imagine what you've been waiting for all night to watch the surrogate Bellator 206, just to get your main event opened.
The account from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main map and live broadcasts spent all night in Great Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's party, the monsters in Great Britain were surprised when the report changed to the Peppa demand order.
Some remained unexplained after the early morning hours of fighting.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in sending a series for children as a "safe form of a bad kind."
"According to the government regulation, such content is not appropriate in 6 hours in the morning, and it is therefore necessary to send the order of the children," said Dave Schwartz, a senior vice-president for the marketing and communication of Bellator after the transfer was asked.
"Peppa's salvation," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said they would work on the program so that in the future, there will be connections and wonders in Britain.
"I think that when I think about sending, we can probably manage it," said Cooker.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, and we won't do it until the week of our time, they'll have their time.
But we're doing it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of textman went there and back and not everyone was just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it could be the government.
I promise you it will not happen again.
We're doing it on five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we've tried hard to keep these fans' promises and we couldn't do it.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "minimum" because of sexuality
The Olympic jump to the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority against all because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he did not realize that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first album Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, said that the voice spoke about gay rights to give the other "hope."
He also said that with the opportunity to become a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of the long-term order of Kirsty Young had a few months of freedom because of disability.
Daley, who appeared as a dropout in Lavern's first program, said that he felt "more valuable" than anyone else who grew up like him because "the community was not friendly to like the boys and girls."
He said, “These feelings of inferiority and disparity have been the real things that gave me strength and a great deal of success.”
He wanted to prove that he was "Somebody," he said not to blame anyone who would somehow find out how it is with his sexuality.
A double holder of the Bronze Olympic medals became a fighter for the LGBT's rights with a high profile and used his presence at the Year Games of Commonualth in Australia to appeal to more countries to demilitarize homosexuality.
He said he was crying because he had a feeling of happiness that he could live openly without consequences and would like others to add “hope”.
This three-year-old world champion suggested that his love for a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – “has become unprepared.”
Daley, who is 20 years old, took the last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you were so young – at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later on cancer – he said that it was not easy to find someone in the same age who lived in a similar entrance and a disaster.
In June, Robert's son, Ray Black-Daley, and Daley, said that he had "changed his whole vision."
"If you'd asked me a question, it would be all in the style "I want to get gold medals," he said.
"You know, there are more things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with cancer of the brain.
Daley said his father didn't agree to his death, and the last thing he asked was if they had any letters in London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the previous row.
"I couldn't tell him, you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and until the moment he stopped breathing and he was dead, I finally realized that he was not available," he said.
This year, Daley participated in the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze.
"I knew I had spent my entire life on it – to jump before the air of our home on Olympic games, I don't know how to feel," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first fund – Proud from Heather Small – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and still caused hair loss.
The Desert Island Discs series is sent to BBC Radio 4 station on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape on Saturday at Ryder Cup, finished at the bar
American Phil Mickelson would get a record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he had to take out the form to prevent it from becoming a unhappy hunter.
Mickelson, who played an event every two years about the record of the substation, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and foursomes to the bar.
Instead of being at the center of the scene, as was often in the United States, he spent his five-year-old head-up on his day racing between the amplifiers and the work on the game in a row he hoped he would do what he had to do.
This 48-year-old player has never been the best of drivers, and even at the top of his career, so there is no ideal choice for Le Golf National, where a long member of the team routinely beats a bomb.
And if it's not a golf course alone to worry about itself, Mickelson is headed for the nine-week champion of the British Open Francescu Molinarim, who won all four of his games this week with the new Tommy Fleetwood team.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, avoided a quick approach, Mickelson's sword could be seen as just basic.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, and he didn't give anything else.
"He just understood the role he had today, called me behind my back, gave me his hand around my shoulder, and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He believes so much.
He is a member of the Chinese team, and in the past and this week, he has been so successful for these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Falda record in most of the west of Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of the career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson achieved 18 victories, 20 proher and seven ranks, although Furyk says his presence has brought certain unwise results to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, funny, fun with people making fun and it's a great company in the team room," he explained.
“I think young players also enjoyed the fun when they went after him this week, which was fun to watch.
It's more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, from experience, knows that a big lead leading to the singles from the last few days in Ryder Cup can easily change into an uncomfortable drive.
Data started on the stock market in 1997 in Valderram, where the company led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-fold jump over the United States, but the goal was to win a total of 141/2-131/2.
"You must always remember that we had a big jump in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we played, and in Valderram, where we only played quietly," Bjorn said, on the picture, after watching, when 5-3 won on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of this team showed me it's not ours.
You're going to make a full offer tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not for you until all these points are on the table.
We have a goal, and that's why we're trying to get this trophie and we're focusing on it.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the best players on the world."
Bjorn, happy that his players led him to a complex golf course, added: “I would never do that myself.
We're waiting for another animal tomorrow.
Tomorrow they're preparing individual performances and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's going well, but if you have to be there for yourself, your golf player's capacity is fully checked.
It's the message you have to deliver to players, get out of yourself tomorrow's best.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of you as well.
In contrast with Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to play his players better than individuals than partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great returns when he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn to end up as a wounded when Europe reached the “Minister’s Vision”.
"I remember every lost word," answered Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999 who raised his players to die by the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to start as soon as Brooklyn as in Medina.
When this speed goes one way, they're putting a significant pressure on those mediums.
Thus, We established the order and made the boys feel as you know, as if we should watch tomorrow."
Thomas was commissioned to try to bring the opposite and set up Rorym McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half of the series.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think he's covering the entire road, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship has been relocated
The most recent German marine frigate was recognised in 2014 to restore an old warship from the era of the war, but it will not be available for at least one year because of the wrong systems and the polluted coast, the local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a whole new class frigate of Baden-Wuertmberg, was based on the Di Zeit of the Civic Language Army, which is now located in the first half of 2019.
The vessel had to be part of the maritime effort in 2014, but the additional problems after the supplier had been resolved by this ambitious project.
As a reward for the old Bremen class frigates, four Baden-Wuertmberg vessels will serve as a replacement for the Bremen class, which was ordered by sea in 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with an effective tool, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-air ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies, such as a reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Another significant function involves a long period of maintenance – it should be possible to set the latest frigates up to two years away from home entrances.
However, the constant delay means that the Spanish marine ships – which were to enable Germany to send the forces to the sea – will be notified by the time they are introduced into the operation of the old, notes Di Zeit.
The fragrant F125 had arrived in a new year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the sea was returned to the ship manufacturer after the transfer.
It was only a little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a series of basic "software errors and launch of war-first" charges that would make the warship useless.
The software challenges were particularly significant because the Baden-Wuertmberg class ship will carry out a crew of some 120 seafarers – half of the workers who needed Bremen's brands.
It has also been shown that the ship has a significant excess load, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of seafarers to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7,000-tunered Rhineland-Palfal ship will be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans during the second world war.
In addition to the launch of warheads, the problem is the cost of the entire project – including training of crews.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price dropped to EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates have been particularly significant in recent warnings that the German marine power is strong.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the marine army is actually "a ship capable of landing."
The representative pointed out that problems had been solved regularly because the old ships had been ordered out of operation, but they had not been provided with any compensation.
Lamented that none of Baden-Wuertmberg's frigates are capable of becoming part of the marine crew.
The National Trust Organization listens to the secret life of the nepotiers
At the seat of the Neapores in Scotland, a new research is being carried out on the issue of how the netopiers use their country for food.
There is hope that research will generate a new light on the conduct of unique flight tips and help to guide future activities for the preservation of this kind.
A study carried out by the scientists of the Association National Trust for Scotland will follow the netopies of stars and at least a long and watery in the Botanical Garden of Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in the key areas in this net feed room, which will monitor net feed activities throughout the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all recordings will find the frequency of calls of nepotiers and what individual species do.
Next will be the map of the habitat and the message that creates a detailed national picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are most important for netopies and how individual species are used.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of a hole, and the best way to maintain the areas based on netify and other related species.
Netypier populations in Scotland and throughout the Great Britain have suffered a great deal in the past century.
They are threatened as a result of construction and land development that affect the colony and the natural environment.
The risk can also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as dust on the mouth and chemical healing of building materials and cracks.
Neapores are not, in fact, blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use the eco-location building technique for the release of brakes and brakes in the flight.
NTSC, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious.
He has trained professionals who regularly carry out research, colonization checks and sometimes rescue work.
This organisation has even set up the first and only blessed netkeeper reservation at the Threave headquarters in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten types of netkeepers in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's seat says it's an ideal land for them.
"We have a great area here in Threave," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and the best habitat.
But it's still too many things we don't know about non-phytosanitary, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to survive."
It underlines the importance of the control of the neapores prior to the start of maintenance work in properties, as it is possible that an unknown destruction of a single mother nest can kill up to 400 male and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
Neapires are protection and it is illegal to kill them, force them, destroy them, or destroy their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to attach her hand to the work and help.
She said: "We have no knowledge of our weak and many other people, nor do we know how many of their people are. We must know more about this."
Ronaldo refuses the charges of rape and his lawyers are willing to appeal to the German newspaper
Cristian Ronaldo noted charges of rape for "false news" and pointed out that people "want to see" using his name.
His lawyers are willing to appeal to the German lawyer Der Spiegel, who informed them of these charges.
This Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of rape by the American Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In fact, he subsequently paid $375,000 for the case, informing Dr Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the release of information on the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and pointed out the information for "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-year-old evaluation holder Gold sword into the camera.
"They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm all right," said the player with a smile.
According to the Reuters agency, Ronald's lawyers are willing to file a complaint by Dr Spiegel of the unsubstantiated charges that they have referred to as “unfailure notification of suspicion in the private area”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz pointed out that the player will require compensation for “a moral damage in the highest due to the severity of a violation which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the time of the end.”
The incident was scheduled to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel apartment and in a casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to her home, where she was reportedly raped by a document in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga claims that Ronaldo fell down after the reported incident and told her that "99 percent" was "square" and "one percent" was broken.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was sensitive.
Maorga also claims that she went to the police and let the pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed with the extraordinary order, because she was "dangerous" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is now forced to resume the procedure because she is still traumatized by the reported incident.
Ronalda, in the time of the attack, bought a famous Italian Yuve club from the Real Madrid Club in Manchester United and bought it in the summer of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will always suffer the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain “will always suffer” if it comes to its status as world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, the secretary for Greg Clark said.
He added that the Toyota UK car sent BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"The agreement is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car has indicated that the impact of delays on borders if the Brexit agreement is not closed can be a job.
At the port of Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured, almost 150 000 cars were manufactured in the last year, 90 % of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain left the EU at the end of the March, we would register the stop of production in our company," Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnstone, said.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in Great Britain, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement as regards the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, states that it closes its drive to the production of Mini cars in Oxford about a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers indicate as a risk to the supplier chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota company’s production line is in operation on the basis of the supply "just at the time" provided by suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If the Great Britain left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could result in a border breach, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and lack of remuneration.
For Toyota, it would not be possible to work on the basis of more than one day in Derbyshire, introduce the company, and this path would lead to the cessation of production.
Mr. Clark said that Theresy May's plans to revive future relations with the EU are "climately calibrated so as not to reach these border controls."
"We need the agreement. We want to have the best trade that is possible, as I say, not only the current success but also the acquisition of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota's company but also from other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is a highly successful supply chain."
Toyota was not able to say how long the product would be stopped, but from a long-term view, it warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and would eventually be on the job.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnston for 24 years and is the president of the committees of the company, pointed out that the members of the committee are still more concerned: “I have the experience that as soon as these places disappear, they will never return.
The speaking government stated: "We have set a precise and coherent plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trompo's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, introduces the White House
The meeting of Donald Trumpa at the high level, represented by General Rod Rosenstein's lawyer, could be “for the next week’s retirement” because he continues the war on the post of the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh, he sent White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is responsible for the work of Robert Mueller's Special Council, which examines the grounds for Russian elections, the relationship between the Trump's sidewalks and Russia and the possible court ban by the President.
If Trump is already missing from the present general power and thus endangers Mueller's independence, Washington's shells are already in place for months to come.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times indicated that Rosenstein was discussing the wearing of a camera to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of meeting with the president through the 25th Supplement.
Rosenstein sent a message.
However, during the past Monday, he was sent to the White House surrounded by reports that he wanted to refuse.
This place was announced on Thursday meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump announced that Rosenstein would not “swift” leave, but then the meeting was delayed so that she would not listen to the Senate trial, where she gave a witness to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Fordová.
On Friday, the FBI ordered a weekly investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which resulted in the full vote of the Senate again.
Trump's press speaker, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox channel on Sunday.
In answer to the question of meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There has not been a date yet, it may be this week, perhaps the next week, with regard to all the others who are in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always report the latest information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference with the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders pointed out that too few press conferences had not been caused by a "twelve" of television reporters, even though she said, "I do not agree to the fact that they are coming out."
Next, she suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would grow.
"The President shall arrange more meetings with questions and answers than any President before him," he added without giving evidence. "We have been looking at this number."
The Conference will continue to be held, said Sanders, but "if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We'll try this and you've seen that we're doing it in the last few weeks and that the actual press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high-level representatives.
The single press conference is a regular one.
This week in New York, the president likely showed why he was released and sometimes a strange view before the gathered reporters.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to avoid Brexit
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and invitation to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent a letter not even six months before the arrival of the Great Britain from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed that it will arrange costs to apply for the status of EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the years, the negotiations between Great Britain and the EU continue to decline, leading to the expected decision of the year on the ground.
However, the British government is also taking steps in preparation for a possible stage of withdrawal without agreement.
I know it must be a very comforting time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from across the EU and beyond do not bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of health services and are prosperous for the patients and communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our immediate wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie acts as a surgical step after head injury
Tigers removed from the state of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie received an emergency surgery after he suffered head injury on Saturday, 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, introduced Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The main trainer of the state of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had occurred a short time ago.
"He came to the fireplace and just broke up there," said Reed.
Trainers and health professionals gave Abercrombie to the outer layer of oxygen and then put it on the knife and prepared it for further evaluation.
A member of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are currently no "no type of/extended injury" details available and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the second in the red triangle, completes the first season for the state of Tennessee after the transfer from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five complete steps, which means a total of 18 steps in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher tax from property when buying property in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will account for higher property tax when buying property in Great Britain, while money will be used to help homeless people in the context of the new Tory plans
This action will neutralise the success of Corby's mind, whose goal is to attract young volleyball
An increase in debt tax from property will be paid to persons who do not pay taxes in Great Britain
It is expected to increase state resources of EUR 120 million per year – to help people without home.
The buyers from abroad will pay higher taxes on the purchase of property when they buy property in Great Britain, while money will be used to help people without homes, reports Theresa Mayova today.
This action will be launched as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young volunteers with the opportunity to provide a price-added accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in tax from the purchase of property will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, while money will strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleep without noise over their heads.
The premium, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay tax from the purchase of property, including higher levels imposed two years ago in other households and the purchase for the purpose of rent, may reach up to three per cent.
It is estimated that there are up to €120 million in state resources per year.
The findings say that the newly established property in London buys 13 per cent of its residents who are not residents of Great Britain, which avoids prices and makes it easier for those who buy first.
A number of rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, became “spirit cities” just because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the rent of property to help young people in their own home.
He accused a large construction company of holding property prices too high by taking the land, but not using it, and urged Mrs. Mayo to make quotas of the prices available to make the "houseless" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing refurbishment, including rent management and termination of "required" deployments.
He also wants to increase the power of the committees to establish new houses.
Ms. Mayow pointed out: “I told Loni that I wanted to earn my efforts as prime minister for the restoration of the British dream — so that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means the correction of our damaged market with property.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life.
However, it cannot be justified to make it easy for entities who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy houses as hard as the hardworking residents of Great Britain.
For many people, dreaming about their own home is too far away and sleepless sleep on the head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross points out that his "highest ambition" is to become a certain phase of the management of Scotland.
The 42-year Scot is pleased with the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently holds a third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the past season.
"I wanted to play behind my country as a player.
I got B volume and it was," Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sports Sound channel.
“But I grew up following Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and that’s always something that will get me back.
But this opportunity would only come if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' presidents in the role of managers Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former chief Alla Athletic says he did not feel any discomfort from the consequences of such names in such a large club as he had previously rejected the prizes from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success would be the question for me at the time if I could get this club back to Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I'd probably be successful if I could get the club back there."
Ross's career in leadership for the first three years, before he acted as an assistant chief in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alla's club join the third group and transformed St. Mirren from the starting event to win the master title right now in the following season.
And Ross says he's got a lot better feeling now than he ever had in his career players in Clyde, Hartlepol, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic clubs.
"They were probably real crystals," recalls a time when Allao got up.
"I really believed that leadership is more real to me than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, I was good at it, and I used to have an appropriate height.
But playing can be boring.
There's a lot of things you have to go through for a week.
I'm always looking at the stress and pressure of the job, but I just have a good feeling about driving.
I always wanted to be a manager and now I do, I feel that in my entire adult life now I feel the most in my skin."
You can hear the entire conversation on the Sports Sound series on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
The study found that great time at the point is Saturday at 17:30 p.m.
The summer wave increased the income of British households facing difficulties, but increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
The figures show that households and bars reported a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting company, who produced the final report, noted: “Stabilized sunlight and more than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that the red followed a similar example as the previous red when it increased its home attendance by 2.8 percent, but the restaurant was even more crowded.
The decline in the restaurant market by 1.8 per cent in June has still declined in June.
Homes and bars that are drinking have already led to the most violent as they have been destroyed by the restaurants.
Gentlemen whose main markets are from food, the sun also suffered, even though not as dramatic as the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between the measured values and the bars, the sales of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food by three per cent of wheat."
Paul Newman, of the analytical company of leisure activities and hospitality, noted: “These results are the continuation of the trend that lasts from the end of the day.
The time and impact of significant social or sport activities are the biggest factors in the area of domestic sales.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to fight, that the annual sales decline of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in the light of current pressures on costs.
The long summer of summer cannot be the worst time for operators of food-producing businesses and time to ask whether the calmer temperatures we have experienced in August bring so much relief."
The overall increase in sales in the economy and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in June, reflecting the decrease in the presentation of the sign.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry’s sales monitor for the British household, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which has been introduced by industry in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account in the social networks they keep before their parents
Every fifth child – only 11 years of age – has a secret account in social networks that is hidden before parents and pedagogy shows research
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed the rise of "false instagram sites"
The reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the complaints indicated that they have a "main" account that parents know about
Every fifth child, only 11 years of age, creates accounts in social networks that they hide before their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid rise in “false instagram accounts” in which photographs are shared.
The reports indicate that it comes to the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the complaints indicated that they have a busy "main" account, which parents know about, and they also have a private account.
One mother, who hit her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site, found that her daughter-in-law hires the others to “strengthen her. ”
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Association of Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) independent schools showed that 40 per cent of students between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, while half of them agree to conduct private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where their parents and pedagogists can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an ineffective director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most highly valued light athlete and President Ian Beattie described the transfer as a great opportunity for those who are in charge of sport as those who will benefit from its long-term experience at the international level in the past decade.
"Eilid has great respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will be very useful if they are a member of the committee," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am excited that I will be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I will be truly successful and that I will help carry sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC professional, was unable to run after a transitional ski attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had an attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it's only time to show me if I'm going to get better or something.
It's exciting, but I've proven full healing, I've learned to walk again, and I'm having fun today!
Thank you for all the exciting news!"
Leather milk producing matik comparison to cows sharing views online
The manufacturing company has distributed online discounts of advertising that compares breast-feeding to coming cows.
As part of the introduction to the market of "the first silent wearer on the world", Envi released a music video with a tape showing the freedom that the new wearer gives to his mother.
Four real mothers dance in the hundreds of full-beds with cows in a song with the text, "Yes, I'm coming, but you don't see any eyes" and "If you don't realize I don't have a date, my breasts are here."
The congregation continues: “Pup, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, I smoke my sweet milk.”
Advertisement published on the company Facebook page, however, has created an online competitive reaction.
The video had 77,000 comments and hundreds of comments, and he received mixed reactions from those who saw him, while many of them indicated that it was a light on the "hours" of the milk industry.
"The very poor decision to abuse the goods on advertising on this product.
Just as we must be pregnant and born to be able to milk, but children are picked up a few days after birth," says one of the commentators.
Elvie is discrepancies on the bone press (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for the mother and the child.
But yes, why don't you use it for the press pump for the mothers who leave their children?"
Another added: "This advertising is completely out of place."
There was also the father who defended the advertising, while one woman admitted that the agreement was considered “not to be a thing. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd fix this pump if I was still driving.
I feel exactly like a queen when I'm resting.
The claim is a little crazy, but it's a matter.
It's a genius product," one user wrote.
Another adds: “It’s a fun advertising about mothers who take milk (often at work or on toilets) and feel like “crowds. ”
It's not a advertising that should honor or destroy the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all dance with discrepancies hidden under the cover.
The concept of campaigning is based on the fact that many women who drink milk appear to feel like cows.
However, Elvie is simply quiet, she has no legs nor hadices, and she is beautifully dressed in her riding shoes, so she gives the woman the freedom to move, the opportunity to keep the child and even to go.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Elvie's successor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative introduction to the market.
By creating parallels between breast-feeding mothers and breast-feeding cows, we wanted to show for the removal of milk and all the challenges associated with it and to show the fun and shared incredible feeling of freedom that the new nurse will ensure.
It's not the first time Elvie's rep.
During the London Week mode, one of the two mothers of the sponsors, Marta Jakubowski, who was just using the product, appeared on the floor.
Children of migrants moved quietly to the state camp at the Texas border
In spite of the fact that the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of children detained by the immigrant population increased, particularly because the strict rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have reduced the placement of children with consent.
Most of the suppliers were traditionally created immigrants without evidence who were afraid of the risk of staying in the country, so they claimed that they belonged to the child.
The risk grew in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the immigration and customs department, testified against Congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people who asked for the status of self-employed minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or sponsors' members are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue in their pursuit," said Mr. Albence.
According to the staff of the asylum devices, representatives of the children have been able to work more quickly on matters concerning children, which will require some of them to be brought before the trial in the month prior to the detention, instead of the previous 60 days of standard.
The meeting shall be made public by calling within the videoconferencing place in person so that its case can be declared as a legal status for an immigrant judge.
Those who, according to the survey, do not have any help, will be deported quickly.
As long as the child is in the care of the child, it is more likely that he will experience difficulties or depression, which may lead to seizures or attempted escape, the workers of the asylum facility will claim and report from the system during the last few months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns have been raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is more likely to suffer, just because of the size of the device.
They added that the transfer of children to the local camp without the time of a dedicated emotional arrangement or the release of friends could lead to the trauma that many children are now fighting.
Syria announced that American, French and Turkish "computer stocks" should be immediately removed
During the general meeting of the United Nations Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualam also called after the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, although there is already eight years of war in the country.
Moual, also representing the prime minister, said that foreign forces on the Syrian territory are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “that is to be punished.”
"It must be delivered immediately and without mention," he said at the meeting.
Moulalem insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over,” and since 2011, more than 360 000 people and millions of others have come from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue in "war in this sacred battle until we get rid of all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreigners present."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria who are heavily trained in Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 units in the field of war.
In the release of the Mouals, he declared that the conditions of return were good for them and accused “some Western countries” of“ the spread of non-racial concerns”, which caused the rebels to refuse to return.
"We have spoken to the international community and humanitarian organization to facilitate these returns," he said.
"politicalize what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and opposition to the end of the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the installation of a protective belt in the last outbreak of Idlib created an opportunity to continue in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a major attack on the Syrian defence forces of Russia in the province where three million people live.
However, Moulal pointed out that the agreement has "explanatory deadlines" and expressed the hope that a military coup will focus on the dissidents, including fighters from the Nusra Front organization, who will "will be defeated."
The Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that soon the first meeting of the new committee of government members and opposition will be held soon and will be held by the members of the government to propose a voluntary constitution for Syria and to set out the road to the elections.
Moulalem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee with the words that the work of the panel should be limited to “the control of the articles of the present constitutions” and issued a warning before the suspension.
Why Trump is welcome and in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also welcome further elections in 2020 if, most liberal observers, regrettably, had not completed his appointment as President.
In such a case, it would certainly be “the most dramatic end of the presidential period in history!”
So far, there are no signs of the following submissions.
Since 2014, monitoring in the main transmission time has been more than doubled to 1,05 million to CNN and almost to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average monitoring of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million years ago according to the Nielsen Agency and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has increased monitoring on cable television on 3.5 million of the following main night news.
"It's a joke that people love because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the director of the "Designed Survivor" series on the ABC drama on the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and series "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It is remembered on a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd love Trump.
Why did she ask?
"He said, 'Because he's funny,' said Mrs. Scovell to me.
It's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories that are playing in about Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wad, even though immigrant families can be reunited and promoted by the global economy.

Money goes out to the most happy domestic competitions in the medium-term volleyball
It is not surprising that the 17th cycle of pensions after the financial commitment has been made thanks to the reorganisation of the congresses, which generated two officers of the Authority in the fight against the same cross.
This has recently led to the conversion of the Pittsburg direct circuit to a genuine democratic republican Conor Lamb, who received another course in the special election of the Loni on Friday.
The Lamb stands against the other officers of the office, the Republican Keithh Rothfus, who is present at the present time representing the old 12th century Pensylvania, which is strongly covered by the new 17.
After the Supreme Court issued its opinion in January that the old classes had been unconstitutionally divided into the interests of the Republicans, a map was drawn up.
In the new 17th cycle, the initiative launched a pilot financial dispute between the main financial markets, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
In Pennsylvania, the name Lamb became famous after a close victory in the followed morning special elections until the 18th Congress.
This was more than a decade's period covered by the Republican and Donald Trump won 20 points in the round.
Politicians give Democrats a peaceful leap.
The United States intends to punish Salvador for China's support, then joins
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing under peaceful pressure in Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panay Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at the hotel in Panama until partners visited the organizational team of Trump's leadership.
The representatives of the foreign ministry decided to call the American diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to be known by Tchaj-wan," said Heather Nauertva in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the trials were directed only against Salvador, which received $140 million of US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed trials, which included cuts in financial aid and aimed at limiting the water, would be for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of deaths of patients.
With further internal meetings, the North American and Central American representatives of the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants moving to the United States.
But by half, the previous administrative representatives explained that they wanted to continue in meetings and to effectively end any sentences imposed on Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the solution of the conference currently planned for half of October, in the framework of a signal that the board administration has introduced diplomats.
And three American envoys returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having any new news from Washington.
In the White House, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed with discussions on the internal negotiations on the terms of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by external analytics who are close to government executives and also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Study history
The final striker could be Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible defence of Mr Trump's law, which is now in the public records of many evidence.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller became aware of the fact that Mr. Trumpa's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding an attack on our will.
If there were to be exchanges in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to report to that body, just as he was preparing to represent again before the voter, and eventually he would have to wait carefully for the jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of "likes", and I do not want to say that Mr Trumpa's plague is inevitable – just as it is in similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic before him has a choice that affects how long suffering will continue.
In 1938, German officials were ready to set foot against Hitler, but only to establish and support his western powers in Minichov Československa.
We sat down and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History is involved in such critical moments that speed up or slow down the path of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a few similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump comes out of the office of General Prosecutor Roda Rosenstein, the man who leads the investigation of Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein had been quoted since the report announced that Loni had secretly proposed to play the president and speculated that he was not in a state of health in order to stop the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times are inexhaustible.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation by the F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugha is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of a convincing charge of sexual assault and false charges?
And what's the most important thing is that we're going to vote in half of the working period to Congress, which is responsible for Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we pass through these trials, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe we don't travel, and that's the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Sloven Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once bought my large-scale home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me on the Sabbath to burn candles on the table with a swastika.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about shooting with Rapid Video
Rangers, on Thursday, Rapid Video with the knowledge that victory over the Racuzane would give them a real hope for the process from the Group G of the European League in Spain on the Villarreal farm earlier this month.
The damage of the train was prevented by depositor Graham Dorrans in order to first appear on the hill to the range 2-2 with Villarreel. He believes, however, that Rangers can use this result as a reflection museum for more things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," declared a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the funeral with the faith that we could get something to do, and we took the point.
Maybe we could still multiply it at the end, but the limit was probably fair.
They must have been better in the first half of the first century, but in the second, we improved and we were even better.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard because in the last game, they've earned a good outcome.
The London year was hard enough, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I feel very good about it.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the coach is fine too.
I hope we'll be ready for this now, we'll have the last season for the head and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about the pension support.
Even though the participants had a clear idea of how to deal with them, only a few people talked to family members about it.
A total of half of the people in the national study reported that they had spent a long time caring price with their partner.
Only 10 percent said she talked to her children about it.
"People want him to be a member of the family, but they don't agree with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice-president of the whole country's lifestyle insurance.
You can start this way.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare a family for the care provided if you don’t give them your request before.
Together with your counsel and family, find out where and how to take care, because these factors can play a big role in determining prices.
Contact your financial adviser: The consultant can help you find a way to earn these expenses.
For example, financing long-term care can help with traditional insurance for long-term care, hybrid income insurance, which will help you pay these expenses, or with own insurance using your own resources – until you have money.
Create your legal documents: Stop legal battle until it goes.
Set up a representative of health care, which will be a reliable person who will look after your doctor’s attention and ensure that doctors will comply with your request if you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also attach full power to your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are stolen if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs medical care and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medicine and allergy?
Write these details down to the written plan so you can be prepared.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a violent earthquake and tsunami that invaded the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units were unable to obtain any information from the Donghunga regency, which is a region north of Palu, which is close to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
Following the outbreak of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are a number of key facts about the city of Palu and the Kingdom of Donginga, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the Central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of the coastal bans on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population were estimated to be 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donghea is an attractive region of more than 300 km (180 km) along the coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main ingredients of the economy of the Province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donghe.
In the province, there is also a significant weight of nickel, which is concentrated primarily in Morozal on the coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian organisation Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donghan have been active in tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by the tsunamis in Donghe and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Donghy in 1996 when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ocean Circle, and regularly comes here to landfill.
Here is a list of some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that invaded 14 countries and prepared 26,000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of the summer and at the beginning of the autumn.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of the 6.8 earthquake hit the Indonesian last island of Java and caused tsunamis that hit the southern border and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people came to life.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatry and caused tsunamis of 10 metres high, destroying dozens of villages and preparing for life of about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit the country of Pidie Jaya in the province of Aceh and led to the destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis since 2004.
This time she didn't make any of them, but more than 100 died from falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin's arrest due to domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Albanian Governors and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
According to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers agency, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, in Aljašce, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, domestic violence and detention.
When, according to the police report, his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report some crimes, Palin phoned her.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held for an unencumbered bond of 500 USD, KTUU's vote.
According to a network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt “very innocent” when he was asked to express himself.
Palin is subjected to three Class A obstacles, which means that it can be suspended up to the year of withdrawal of the exemption and to the return of up to $250,000.
He was also accused of class B infringement, which was punishable by a single prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palin has to face a criminal notice.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todda Palina.
A criminal attack on the police reported his mother's phone, Sarah Palin's.
The case is currently before the German court for war veterans.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, of violating the notification of domestic violence and of holding weapons under the influence of the opium in connection with the incident.
He suddenly hit his girlfriend's face.
Sarah Palinova was criticized by a group of war veterans in 2016 when her son’s violent behavior was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the child’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after landing on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks are out of operation, and in the coming days, the numbers of victims are expected to rise.
The earthquake hit directly on the coast of the island of Sulawesi, which is located north of the Indonesian capital Jakarty.
On social media, a video showing the moment of horror appeared.
The crowds gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal applicants require an exceptional death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, who is suspected of surviving a terrorist attack in New York where eight people have died, namely an exceptional punishment that has not been committed for federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly carried out an attack on the cycle of West Side Highway in the fourth Lower Manhattan with the help of the founder Home Depot, who stopped walking and cycling.
In order to enforce the death penalty, the complainants will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims “simply” and “simply” caused a number of injuries – thus defining the conditions for the death penalty in accordance with a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to the court documents, both of these figures would mean the possibility of execution of the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court accused Saipov of 22 criminal acts, including the murder in favour of the destruction, which was usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The auction called for "a significant planning and preparation", the complainants claim and describe the way Saipov acted as an optimum, cruel and renegade."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decaidadwe, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlijová, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pannucca," he says.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court finally sentenced the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Finally, the death penalty was actually executed in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when a couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were repaired, which was shown to be held for the purpose of spying for the Soviet Union during the two years before the war.
Both Rosenberg sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, appeared in court documents during the days and months following the attack of a minimum suffering.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to the Saip's accusation, he was inspired by a video from the Islamic State on the phone to rescue the attack.
The police also announced that they also requested an extension of the Islamic State's flag in the hospital room.
He said he was innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said that they are clearly "damaged" by the decision of the complainants.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty instead of adopting the confession of wines and reassessment of life without permission will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov prosecutors had already asked the complainant not to ask for the death penalty.
According to the Conservative Party’s MEPs, it should be trusted by the Brexit NIGEL FARAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party's conference, Nigel Farage has undertaken to mobilize the people's army.
The former Leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party stated that the political must feel pressure from the Eurosceptics – as proposed by one of its own Members Theresy Mayows – should bring an agreement with the EU.
On the way to Birmingham, the Swedish Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone announced that Great Britain would be out now if he was a secretary for Brexit Mr. Farage.
But the problem that Ms. Mayov faces in resolving her lines, where she is having a deep dispute, has still been raised by conservatives struggling to stay in the EU, who have joined in a self-propelled protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan from Chequers under attack by the residents of Brexit, the rest of the Union and the EU itself.
The participants insist that they will continue to try to agree with Brussels without regard to the consequences – and will require Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and , Chaosem’.
Mr. Bonne reported that the Leave Means Leave group was meeting in Solihul, where he wanted to appear at the Chequers.
Mr Farage proposed that he should become a representative and be responsible for communicating with Brussels.
"If he were in his head, we would already be out today," he declared.
Ambassador Wellingborough added: , I'll set up for Brexit, but we have to go to Chequers.”
To show his response to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to listen.
In our own country we want to make our own laws."
Mr. Bonne rejected the proposal that the public change since the vote in 2016 has changed: , The idea that the British citizens would change their views and want to maintain is simply misleading.”
Conservative stay of Brexit Andrea Jenkys, who also participated in the event, sent the reporters: , I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
,Chequers is not popular in the general public, opposition will not vote for him and he does not like our members or our activists who are currently in full street to be elected.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp report to Mrs Mayow, she says, "Minister presidents will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that conservative policies must be reached in an unacceptable situation if they wanted to reverse their decisions adopted on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you go."
In the above-mentioned report, he added: ,Chci, that our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit's rebellion, felt pressure.
"We will not mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not start until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain that is ruling itself."
The residents of the Union, inter alia, came to Birmingham and then arranged a two-day meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had transparent Conservatives against Brexit after the opening of the weekend of the operation of this page.
The Labour Ambassador, Lord Adonis, spoke to the conservatives about problems with the security of the party's application after the opening of the conference.
"These are people who, according to their own words, will be able to ensure IT systems and technologies for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's the whole thing.
There is nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan is to think about the president's candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that after November's elections, he would "mean the candidate to the president".
Boston Globe reports that a democracy with Massachusetts spoke about its future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts workshop.
Warren, a prominent critic, Donalda Trumpa, is trying to reopen November against the Republican representative of Geoffu Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trompo campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It seemed at the center of speculation that it would be possible to set up Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, her 36th meeting with the volunteers at the workshop from the moment Trump sat in the office.
One of the participants asked her whether she was planning to attend the president's office.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and perform our division of government, which also means a woman at the highest point."
He was suspected of shooting Simse from the LSU.
The police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she was holding a suspect from a five-year-old basketball player's team on the LSU Wayda Sims.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteona Simpson, at 11:00 Conference ET news.
The video was released from the battalion shooting with a request for the identification of the man caught in the player.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday in early hours near the University of Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that did not fit in with life," police officer Murphy J. Paul sent on Saturday through web 247sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was heard and admitted that he was moving to the scene, had a gun, and admitted to the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
6 feet and 6 fingers of high Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 plays, of which 10 were in the last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 tracks for the game.
Russia's big price: Lewis Hamilton drew close to the title of the master of the world when his team's regime joined him in victory over Sebastian Vettel
Right now, when Valtteri Bottas finished the Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team will play a great role in the race.
In the field of position, Bottas had a good start and almost stopped Hamilton when in the first two clicks he broke his position and called Vettela to attack the team's partner.
The winner took to the roof as the first and let Hamilton take the truck to the corner of the group, which should be exciting.
Jezdec Mercedes went to the roof around later, and after he left, he was assigned to Vettel. This same Hamlton expressed his face and, in a quiet room, had to leave Ferrari with no difficulty in leaving the inner drive freely in order to defend himself after the second manoeuvre in the third battle.
Max Verstappen came out of the back row of the train field and at the end of the first train he was born on the day of his 21th birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race because he kept the original pneumatics as far as possible to focus on the fast finish and could support Kimima Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he got to the bottom in the 44th wheel, but in the remaining eight wheels he was unable to raise the pace, and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri was taking great work all weekend, and when he got orders, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
The team brought the fantastic work and the reward were the first two places," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad word of body.
President Donald Trump spoke to Senator Diane Feinstein at the Saturday meeting because she insisted that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford's candidate, the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, with sexual assault.
During the meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly comment on the statement made by the Forum before the Senate Court, rather than stating that what is happening in the Senate indicates that people are “bad and opposed and spreading.”
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that happens in the last days in Senara, when you see the attitude when you see those people, how they are angry and cruel and rebellious and profaning," he said.
"When you look at the publication and the publication, and they will say to you, 'Ah, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, can you give me the prize?
Remember her answer... you published the document - ,ach, uh, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't make it up."
Well, wait a minute.
We made it... no, it's not," he added and looked like it at the senator.
Feinstein sent the Ford’s letter with details of the charge against Kavanaugh in July and the information disappeared at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's address, nor did I publish the case," said Clomis Feinstein, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
According to all her words, the president, who spoke at the meeting on Saturday evening, said: “I tell you, this is a serious matter of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but anyway it's the worst thing I've ever seen."
The President continued in the defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual harassment, and pointed out that the Democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take a great deal of back any available means.
You see this subato, here's security, there's one who's hurt who has to fall into the country to get back to power and to the cormide," the Mediaite quoted the president's words.
Elite Link: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer twice took care of Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made a five-way escape in the Elite League against Belfast Giant in the Saturday drive in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
Giant soon caught up with the double-bank leadership of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to make a home balance before Dwyer returned Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard then compared Dundee again, with two branches of Lukase Lundvalda Nielsen.
It was a third strike in the Elitnian League in the season for Adam Keefe's team, which took place on Friday in Belfast Dundee to defeat 2-1.
The two teams met in the season, and all three of the previous games ruled Giants.
Two of the first branches arrived in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford joined the assistant at Beauvillier's second head about four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back to the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a head for Cownie, which compared at 15:16.
Thanks to the Dwyers, Ginants went to the cabin for the first stop only when he recorded his second main night at the end of the first quarter.
The housekeepers went over and Bouchard was again able to fix the cave from the violent game at 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcorana's joint work later helped Nielsen's second third party to recapture the lead on the Dundee side, and this player assured his team's lead in half the final third.
Giants, who now played the fourth of the last five games, will play another game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The driver of the flight died to enable hundreds of people to escape landing on the deck of the plane
The lead air traffic in Indonesia is celebrated as a castle after what he lost when he saw hundreds of people flying safely on board.
More than 800 people were missing and many were missing after the great earthquake that caused tsunamis in the fifth island of Sulawesi.
The following strong waves swept the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But while colleagues of the eleven-year-old Anthony Guanawan Agung fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the diocese with the refuse of the leader of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to be sure that the flight of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the plane, will be safe.
Then he jumped out of the chain manager down when he thought he was in a hurry.
He died in the hospital later.
The air navigation director of Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, informed the TV channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped to save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a transport from Balikpapa in Kalimantan, which was transferred to a hospital in another town.
I'm sorry he died this morning before he got to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities feared that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster resolution indicated that access to Donghe, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of deaths continues to rise, as many bodies remain not released under the yoke and many survivors have not been found," said the speech agency Sutopo Purvo Nugro.
The waves in the 19th floor of the Palu reached altitudes up to six meters, and the city will end the mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are bringing assistance and supplies to the affected places.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News station: “Every minute the ambulance will bring another body.
There's not enough drinking water here.
Small businesses are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN Station: “The Indian Red Cross is trying to survive, but we do not know what they will find in the place.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indian President Joko Vidodo came to Palu on Sunday and delivered to the military camps: “I ask you to work day and night and to complete all the duties needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
In this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people were killed.
Air Niugini Airport in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after the plane crash in the garage
The flying company, which was flying in the garage on one of the islands of the Pacific, now indicated that one person was wrong, and at the beginning it indicated that all passengers and crew who were reading all 47 persons safely evacuated from the flying plane.
Air Niugini indicated in the press report that it was not possible to find a traveling man on Saturday afternoon.
The airlines indicated that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search of a lost husband.
The airlines did not respond immediately to the requirements for providing details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after which the aircraft landed in the water in an attempt to join the Chuuk island.
On Friday, officials claimed that there were seven persons transferred to the hospital.
The airlines indicated that six passengers remained in the hospital and on Saturday and all were in a stabilized condition.
However, what caused the accident and the exact sequence of the incident remains unclear.
The U.S. airlines and Marines have indicated that the aircraft has landed in the station even before the arrival of the train.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was over.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane had reached very small altitudes.
"It was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes further indicated that he, along with the others, managed to get water from a dog deep into the emergency exits of a flying plane.
He further indicated that the fireman panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that seafarers who worked near the coastal resorts helped to save the crew who had been crossing the coast before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades, aircraft died in accidents with the registration mark of PNG total of 111 people, but no accident occurred to Air Niguni.
Analytical describes the last moments of women burned alive
The complaint ended on Saturday in this case in which a man is again close to the fire of a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice in the person of Paul Rowletta's analysis witnessed several hours and provided expert insights into the intelligence analysis.
The jury's analysis of how he used the records from the phone number 29 of Quinton Tellis and the 19th-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett pointed out that he got a location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was dead on the night of his death in Chambers' company, which was in conflict with his previous statement, listed The Clarion Ledger.
On the basis of the cell phone data, he was shown that he spent the night with Chambers, admitted he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then visited the police.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that the day concerned was not in the city.
When the complainants wondered if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that "he lied because my car was in Nashville that night."
The next thing they could not do was tell Tellis that he knew Chambers about two weeks after her death.
However, the phone records indicate that the two knew only one week.
Rowlett indicated that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, he was able to get Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He beat her all his life," said Hale.
The defense will start its final word on Sunday.
The judge indicated that the case was expected to be brought before the jury within a few days.
High Breed: What is a known hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to settle with negative views on this genre by filling up its song with positive references.
Capla High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political relations and solutions to social problems.
So they want to return to the roots and repopulate the scientific hip hop.
Artists, such as The Fugees and Commons, have recently met with survivors such as Akal and Lowkey in Great Britain.
Another black man?!
NY rescuer complains a couple of times about his "risistic" text message.
The director of New York complains a couple of times about his discriminatory outbursts after she received the wrong text message from her mother, in which she was marked as a "other black" text message.
A few denied that they were racists and likened the claim to "revealing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her surprise when the first day of work in 2016 found that the new teacher of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NIEEÉÉÉ, DELKY ČERNOŠKA," wrote the P.P. Plasco-Flaxman to his wife in a text message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her a drink twice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman came out of Maurice and pointed out that her right-wing nurse, who was an African, was working really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, introduced a New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and Uber was sent home.
Maurice now complains about compensation for removal from work and requests a compensation of $350 per day for the six-month commitment for which she was hired at the beginning of the contract, although not closed.
"I want to show them that this isn't going to happen," she added the Post this Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the two returned their compliments that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that they could no longer believe her after that attack.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
He's definitely not a racist.
We're no racist," her husband, Joel Plasco, introduced the Post list.
"But you may believe your child in the hand of someone to whom you have acted arrogantly, even though it was a mistake.
Your newborn child?
But come on."
Plasco compared the claim to "discovering" and pointed out that his wife had only two months to care for an older child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you ride for someone like that?
That's not really a good thing," the investment banker pointed out.
Even though there is still a court case, the judge on social media is very quick to judge two for their behavior and logic.
Newspapers about the bear Paddington were afraid that readers were indifferent to the bear, showing the latest reports
Karen Jankel’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, reported: “It’s hard to get into the situation of someone who read it first, even before it was published.
It's very interesting to know that now we know the huge success of the Paddington bear."
She noted that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write a book on a small lung bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of a book that became a “sympathetic” course after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family”, she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was never quite ecstatic," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like you had a child who got something that you could really be proud of.
I think Paddington's success was looking for this view.
Even though it was his only creation and imagination, he always tried to record all the successes of only Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Her daughter was immediately transferred to the Louise Pasteura 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called on me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he does not expect it to happen," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I had a call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors gave her in order to keep her heart on course gradually lost her effectiveness and left her body.
She died a short time later, and it was like it was all over.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't break or steal because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, landed on the plane together with other passengers without revealing what a difficult trial she is going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I kept my head covered, all the time I walked through my cheeks.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the summer when I felt a tremendous understanding in Nadov.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how powerful he loved her."
Screaming women send out surveillance to prevent suicide at the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are spreading the views of the Welsh bridge with inspiring links and telephone numbers on which people can look for support.
The son of Tyler Davis was only 13 years old when he began to suffer depression and, as a result, he was 18 years old.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and living in Lydney, said her son was a young cook with a promising smile.
"Everyone knew him through his smile.
They always said that his smile made it clear to every room."
Still, before his death, he quit his job because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014 Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found an immortal body of his cousin after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I am still afraid of the effect it will have on his life."
Ms. Davis suggested that “to inform people that they have someone who is willing to help them and can talk to them even if they have something to say about their friends.
Do not sit still – you must speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who's a friend of Mrs. Davis's flight, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, and it's shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he felt on the day, or depressed, at all, nothing," he explains.
"A few days ago, we noticed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst day when the children opened their gifts, and they didn't even look at them.
She pointed out that her partner’s death was a tremendous tragedy for them, but she had to cope progressively: “This is the way the family can do it.
It broke us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on how the FBI starts its investigation
"I thought we could get something that he actually asked for – an investigation at a time of limitation, with a limited amount – we could put a little unit into it," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "disappear" because both parties would be able to buy on future positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The elections in the half of the voluntary period are only five weeks away from us on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to do so, this will lead to their fundamental failure in their attempts to prosecute the man they are required to serve in the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, hired them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and met with his wife, Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI collects its message?
The Senate will vote on this and at present there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can hold at least 50 votes in Senate, which has enabled Vice-President Mika Pence to break the sentence and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
Number of snowflakes from North Korea for Kima "lossed"
Since the beginning of the government of Kim Čong-Una, the number of refugees from North Korea has fallen down seven years ago, says a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Federal Ministry of Association, indicated that 1127 ran in the last year – compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further pointed out that there are stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates of passengers required at border crossings.
Phyjungjang has not issued any public statements.
A large majority of the people from the North today receive an offer to the South Korean population.
Saul claims that from the end of the Korean War in 1953 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border.
Most of them escape from China, which has the highest border with North Korea and is more likely to cross it than in a heavily protected demilitarized dog (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The tea on tops looks like illegal migrants and not like on tops and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and Jihem – which is still in the war situation – has improved significantly in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchjongjang for talks aimed at the halted denuclearization meeting.
This led to the historic meeting of Presidents USA Donalda Trumpa and Kim Čong-una in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear recovery of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the United States of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way for us to be left alone," Mr Ri pointed out before the UN Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosie called Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
According to the democratic minority Nancy Pelosie called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh "hissterical" and pointed out that thanks to its temperature it is inappropriate for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this note during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help myself, but if any woman had made such a feast, they would call it a hysterical," said Pelosie in her reaction to the fourth report before the Senate Court Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all charges that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey for the time when they were both in the puberty age.
During his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes nearly screamed and moved to a middle school meeting about his family and his age.
He also strongly condemned democracy in the Committee and pointed out that their charges against him are "great and coordinated attacks" organised by liberals who were unable to pass through the Hillary Clinton Prize in the presidential elections in 2016.
The Palosian report showed that Kavanaugh's report proved that he was not able to work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was opposed to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself by the statements and the way he has addressed the Clinton and Democrats," she said.
The Palosi replied in an infamous manner to the question whether she would attempt to call Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, even though the Democrats obtained a majority of the Smömova representatives.
“I will tell you this – if Congress does not tell the truth, then it is not only possible for the Supreme Court to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where it is now,” Pelosie said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the appeal court D.C. .
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the potential outcome of Kavanaugh in court at the Law on friendly care or Roe vs. Wade because she was considered a conservative judge.
In the course of hearing his previous confirmation in function, Kavanaugh turned out to answer the question whether he would return any decision of the Supreme Court.
"There's no time on the hysterical, proposed person to come to the court and expect us to just say "Yes, that's great," said Pelosie.
And women have to control it.
After the verbal events, months, and years of drought, it was impossible to escape without crying.
"We cry when we're tired," said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “It helped me a lot by the woman who worked for the director and who told me that she was also crying when she was pregnant, but she created a certain technique, meaning that when she was pregnant and started to cry, she said to the person who spoke to her: “You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm busy."
And that's what she's been doing.
And I think it's great."
The sludges are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are not understood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job where I worked at the office where men were dominant, once I expressed my inexhaustible attitude to crying. But older, always cold manager, who was always a little scared, caught me for a church and took me to the hospital.
"Never show them that you're crying," she said.
"She doesn't know you're pregnant.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart arrived at a non-manly affair on the board of the Monkey Business, he had to stand out of the fight. Mrs. Schrodeer, deeply frustrated, found out that he had no reason why he could not examine his own presidential candidate's opinion.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I laughed after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snöhrka and seven patient people."
Since the campaign had been running for a long time, however, it was unable to take steps to obtain contributions, and it was concluded that it would not go into stock if it did not win the $2 million contribution.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate to give it only $250.
"Do you think I'm gonna get a discount?" she thought.
When she said that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was simply convinced by her emotions – as an expression of her gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to get money and to focus more on the voters than on the delegates, and with regard to sexism, that she was completely motivated by pride.
"Maybe you would think I was nervously upset," said Mrs. Schroder about how he reacted to her pressure.
"And maybe you would think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my backstone.
"Plakala"?
Why can there be a Chinese-American trade war for Beijing good
The initial trade savings between the United States and China were impressive, and even though the war is not far-reaching, experts say that the trade between countries in a long-term view is useful for Beijing.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning this year that he considered Chinese exports, including solar panels, steels and lead.
However, most of the largest scalables observed the light of the world this week when new prices for the product were announced for 200 billion USD (250 billion GBP), which is practically the taxion of half of Chinese exports to the USA.
Peking has always responded to the latest tariffs for five to ten percent of the 60 billion US goods.
China has tried to pay the US the same coin, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world would climb to the knees.
Even though China would like Washington to return to its original tracks, it would mean to meet its requirements, but the publicization of American requirements would be very humiliating for Chinese President Si Çin-pching.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the mutual dependence of these two economies.
"The reality is that the rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would put an economic downturn in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have already agreed," said Abigail Grace, a research co-operative who is focusing on Asia in the thinking of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be prepared for voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country that has experienced more than seven years of war.
In his speech at the OSN meeting, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualel indicated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of the missing terrorists into the normal state.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country due to terrorism are now fulfilled, as are the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem indicated that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the construction of the developed country.
However, he stressed that we would not accept any conditional aid or aid from the countries that were sponsoring the attacks.
Europe has responded differently to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won Ryder Cup in 2018 with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 at Le Golf National in the end of the trouble in France.
The United States has now lost six of its own on European soil. So Ryder Cup has not won in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again gained the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn arrived with his team at 14,5 points that were needed for the United States strike.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who fought most of the tournaments, then fired the sword into the water on 3 pairs of 16 jacks and left the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari then jumped into all his bikes and became one of the four players and achieved the best score 5-0-0 since he was approved in 1979 by the current tournament format.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olisen from Denmark.
The most valuable world player Dustin Johnson played 2 and 1 with Jan Poulter from England, who apparently graduated his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points won for his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help.
It's been a hard year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the fire back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," said Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He gave the fire to his country John Rampo, who destroyed American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible feeling that I've lost Tiger Woods, but I grew up following this guy," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods won all four games in France and now recorded a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Similar statistics of one of the best players all the time that got 14 biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend trying to find the fairies, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had presented the spectacular golf course throughout the entire tour.
The captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, said to his team: “I am proud of these guys, they really fought.
We really burned Europe this morning.
We really didn't do it.
I'm making a clown in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We cross over and in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee move forward.
I like those 12 boys, I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to get out of here.
You've played us."
Update of the red layer: Concentrations are reduced in the Pinnellas, Manatee and Sarasota periods
The latest report of the Commission of Florida Fish and Wildlife shows the overall decline in the concentration of the red river in the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC’s communication, dark drinking water is now reported from the periods of Pineles, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this means lowering concentration.
The flowering waters of the Red Sea have a range of about 130 miles from the northern period of Pinnellas to the southern period of Lee.
The peaks were observed about 10 miles from the border during the Hillsborough period, but last week it was relatively less than a place.
The red tide was also observed during the Pasco period.
Last week the average concentration in the coast or on the free sea during the Pinnellas period was reported. During the Hillsborough period, low to high concentrations were observed on the free sea, the lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee period, the lowest to high levels in the coast or on the free sea during the Sarasota period, the lowest to the medium concentration in the Charlotte period, the lowest to the highest in the coast or the free sea during the Lee period and the low concentration in the Collier period.
Respiratory disorders continue to occur in Pinnellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
The respiratory tract was not reported in the northwestern Florida last week.
