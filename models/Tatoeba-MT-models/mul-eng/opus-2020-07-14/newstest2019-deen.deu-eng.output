Yeah, she wants to...
"Pleasing Münchnerin" 2018!
On the afternoon another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not only fight the romantic Candlelight Shooting in front of MY SOLRIS, but on the side of the Mali model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirts, cocktails, conduct - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates are delivering from the shooting with people's photographer Tuan and despite wind, gas and rain as real professional.
The romantic Shooting is in the video:
DFB Chief Grindel does not see a basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return from Mesut Ösil to the National Mission.
"This is a question, of course, that one comes to talk to him about why he has found one or another as clearly as it is in his status," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmeher" of the "Prasenmeher".
Despite the current monthly debate on the photos of Ösil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the return of the 92-fold national player Ösil.
"I would have liked if Mesut Ösil had continued to play for Germany.
I've also spent up to a certain point that it would be so," Grindel said.
The 29-year-olds had explained his return from the DFB team in July and also reasoned that he had not been protected from racist attacks during the WM.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism to Özil that this was not ready for a conversation with the Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and teammate Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build a print, but he knew it from the football game that if "you leave a man or change a deal that you're talking to his coach and I'm sorry that this conversation has not been possible before".
Linz: Garden kitchens in Schrebergertensigning Burns
At 14.13 p.m., the professional firefight Linz was alarmed to a fire in the entranceway.
Because a high voltage led directly through the Schrebergerarttensing site, danger was in sight.
The trainer fire broke out and found the shelters in full-burned.
The roof had to be removed practically to the ends and the fire protection was to be extended to the required extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden, he had marked a battery for loading on Wednesday.
That could be the brand-new case.
In any case, the loading device is called fire weir in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be identified - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, he may have been important because the owner had many collections in his garden.
Growing mother turns herself: Lindsay Lohan gets a refugee family on the open street
What has Lindsay Lohan only contributed to this extremely remarkable action?
She wanted an alleged refugee family to bring up the children.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Full Loaded") has flown live itself as a family in Moscow apparently wants to introduce the children.
It reports the US-Portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial share of the stream.
Here you can see "Zum Küdzed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the Clip is to see how Lohan grows out of a car and goes to a possibly undiscovered family that wants to be raised as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flies right in front of the player, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She is concerned about the trafficking of children in adults.
For all of this, she doesn't give evidence in the Clip.
"The whole world sees it right," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the way.
Obviously, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems that the apparently angry mother is enough.
It looks as if she's turning around and Lohan's wearing a ring.
Under the trains, the player means how shocked she is - and she keeps the game.
What Lohan has moved to this action is now completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The song "Hayabusa2" began in December 2014 in Japan.
She should be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that she can clean up material from her surface and bring it to the ground.
The land "mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticket: The number of deaths on Sulawesi rose to over 400
After the heavy earthquake of strength 7,5 and associated tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of tenders may increase further.
The rescue personnel are not yet in the areas that are affected and excluded from the outside world.
Elon Musk returns as Tesla's visual editor
At first, it was a tweet.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk provided August for rest on the stock markets when he announced a return of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. survey accused him of fraud, but now they both agreed.
Tesla and Musk must pay, and the Head of Tesla will return from the Board of Supervisors, but he may remain president.

Protesters in Brazil against the law police Bolsonaro.
"El Nao" means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the vote was taken in the country.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against the law-political police Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trup Brazilians" is present as an anti-system candidate and is therefore present in the questions.
His toughest rival is Fernando Haddad from the left of the working party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still there," said Development Board Peter Mertens to the "Automobile Week".
The arrested and authorized Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, it is expected that all engine/getriebe combinations have been tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "In the beginning of July, we have reached an important stage in the management of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was established in September 2015 following the discovery of the Dieselscanal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "gravitational organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
On Friday, the VW Board of Directors had rejected a decision on the future of the cityrs and wanted to discuss it further on this day of service.
The investigation authorities shall submit to the Court of Auditors to allow the sale of this product with false off-gas values after the notification of the waste disposal authorities.
He knew about the manipulations or ignored them.
Mr Bram Schot is currently taking over the company as Commissioner.
Because of the conversion to the new greenhouse gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production accidents at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a sensitive demand for limosins such as the Audi Models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment is difficult," he said.
Shoots on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first audio electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel pursues re-election - Lahm to enter DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus and the Özil-Affrey next year, wants to apply again for the office as DFB President.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," Grindel said as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You always have to try again, and I'll do it again.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, it would be "markable" if he did not have "last to work on the future project" after the addition to the football-EM 2024.
Grindel has been the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach since April 2016.
In autumn 2016 he was selected for the first complete term of office of three years.
The next vote will take place on 27 September 2019 at the DFB Bundesday.
The future EM Cheforganiser Philipp Lahm will work on the DFB Press.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role, he would also talk to the Bureau in the future and then, of course, be invited to make his experience available on sports issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation that Lahm could become his successor as DFB Chief.
As a consequence of the campaign about the photos of Mesut Ösil and Ilyka Gündogan with Turkish president Recep Tayyyip Erdogan expressed the desire that in the future a national player should become without a migration background of the DFB integration message.
At present, this office of the Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, has recently had family roots in Cameroon.
"If a non-Migrating background is clearly involved in society and football and says "the topic is important, because we need to take care of ourselves," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our unity in a place where integration needs to work," said Grindel.

A 261 run of the basket quickly provided clear conditions.
Opened above, Moschee opens in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan officially opened the Dibi-Moschee in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Criticik and Germany
In his opening address, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver survivors of the Golden Movement in Germany and to oppose Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - wherever they live.
We will not be allowed to torture our citizens and damage the German-Turkey friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Dibib-Mosche, the Kolner Innenstadt was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were also using them to protect them.
The Dibib Islamic Union is in crisis because it is considered to be a longer arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buffalos and seconds
Musicaries such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert in New York Central Park for more engagement in combating poverty and disease.
"Access you, wherever you can be," said Mendes at the festival at night to the Sunday morning before about 60,000 visitors.
Thanks for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B is in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Players, such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations also showed themselves at the multi-stakeholder show on the stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a seconds ago when many visitors held the noise of a falling metal stop for shoes, conceived fear and tried to fly.
Soon panic broke out, people ran through each other.
Seven visitors were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York Police and the musician Chris Martin, however, relieved the people from the stage.
"Nobody tries to hurt someone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available on the Internet as free each year.
Anyone who wanted to create a teacher had to read and spread on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the many musicians and actors, it was made by the Public Jubel and Applaus - Buhrufe for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, however, spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons at the stage for more equal rights of men and women.
On Friday, however, the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, which resulted in many women being shot at the head.
At least three women have resorted to abuses until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which is returned.
Flake asked for a FBI investigation of the claims after two women who had experienced their own sexual abuses on the way to the Committee's sitting in a raise.
"You may also like to meet with me at any time in a ride," says Flake at the concert in New York to the audience.
Press Freedom: Federal Government protects the journalist's reputation
The government spokesmen Steffen Seibert defended the draft of a journalist at the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German title "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-Shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
There was an interruption of the closing of the press conference.
The journalist's action would have created a strong silence, which would not be interesting.
He's ordered that personal defenders deliver the man.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political cases at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor.
This applies entirely to whether it is a legitimate case or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are called for spying activities or support or membership in banned parties or the fethullah-guille movement.
The Turkish leadership shall be responsible for the movement of the broken powder test on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists spent several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain before the Turkish authorities: The Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested in early September.
Finally, the cases of the arrested journalist Meshale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had been taken into consideration.
Although they were free and able to return to Germany, there were still processes against both of them in Turkey.
München: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and well-known: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look there twice: yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for a warm breakfast talk at the Theque of the Hamburg port button "Schelfish Posts".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, sits on some beer, some wine or even a higher percentage of drinks to accommodate the mood and songs.
Not a few promises are also involved in the mandatory music sets.
On Friday another result of the popular talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "men's hearts", "Terror - Your judgment" or "The worst day".
The Münchner was able to travel in the high north, but not quite well.
On Saturday he posted a suicide - his face is totally curious about it, the eyes are only two small pieces.
The Bet-Selfie shows a completely detached Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's got only a powerful cat.
At his feet, he posted some - perhaps not very serious - findings he has now gained: "Actually one: it's NOT going to Inas night.
Rule two: don't drink the black Sau.
And Spritz.
And the round iron lamp, which is about three inaugurals, also leaves.
The consumption of alcohol is really written in front of the 43-year-olds.
His fans also put a few tips to fight the waves.
They are fed by instant breakers, fish bites or - possibly at the most target - headache tablets.
Others were simply concerned about the appearance of the typical attractive kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night salinity, it is not yet known.
But since it has been modernising the TV space on the screen since 2007, it seems that the 53-year-olds seem to be significantly more...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and unrat
The entrance to the 36 km long road in the Rottkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and smell.
Recipes against gravitating vandalism are sought, but solutions do not work out.
Scratch, cigarette kiln, powder and unrat, demolitioned molluscs and medium disassembled drawings - such as since the time of the entrance with a seat group on the road on the seabed in Treysa.
For the preview, the road route in Rotkäpchenland is more than an improbable view.
The theme is the work of members of the ADFC Orts group Schwalmstadt, but also of others already, as the city’s traffic officer Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been discussed in the road transport sector.
There's no solution until then.
The proposals range from the delegation of the sitting group to regular disposal of waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entrance site.
"I think it would be the last offer of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Westhaven.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been inserted into the area.
Not only do drivers and residents drive around - the sitting group is a regular meeting point for the weekend.
It is not only often said, when the plants are destroyed, but it is also destroyed: dust from the ground, molluscs demolitioned, paintings turned around, seat furniture cut off.
Volunteers had already been more frequent, told ADFC member Susanne Klipper.
But the actions were only the verbal troops on the hot stone.
They are worried that the beach on the road in Treysa is the meeting point for the safety station.
"At the end of the entire railway line, there is clearly the focus of the Haaße hill," confirmed the railway operator, who is now also looking for the new railway station in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"It leads to the same shell, it's going to be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe it makes the shadows significantly higher to fit together.
However, this would require that a police officer be present in time.
In principle, Westhaven wants a development of the haaße hill.
He needs to be more attractive.
To date, the frequency of the radar can be very satisfactory.
The tourist market is still reliable.
Our route is very high compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger situation, ADFC member Susanne Klipper appreciates the situation on the Ascherred Road in Treysa.
There's no escape on the Haaße hill.
In the course of a series of traffic, it can happen that drivers have to wait on the road between the two-side traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but it is for older people and especially for children.
Music contest in the cultural train station: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the sea
The first call to the music concert was a success, creative and in the middle.
"D a song for Hiltrup," the city's appellation calls for philtrup, in the "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye connections in the sympathic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family partner in coffee and kitchens from the honourable members of the cultural center.
Seven formations include, from the one-man band to the great assembly: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hitler-lived Albanians, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star colours", three members and three generations of the family's Trenkamp and Claus, a collection from the children's garden Lummerland and finally rich Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't experienced that in other parts of the city yet.
Where did the text come from?
The Hiltruper Sea and the market hall were particularly frequently mentioned at the places.
Rolf Ihmig called all of them in his slammered song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural train station has also been awarded.
It was always about the experience of each other at these places, especially in Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their creation.
So he learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitars.
Franke, from Tontechnique Stefan Schemmelmann, was able to report that the young man appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all of his hands on youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, for the interests of the jury there was something special - so that others could also hear their voices.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can play a song: Immigrate with his hippie sculptor, who especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two tutors at guitar and Cajon, Laura Castner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children get up to the end once again - and even cry without electronic support "just good," as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to hiltrup, accessibility of the melody and reconnaissance value.
The jury was Mr. Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische School for Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Union, as well as Jan Kaven, president of the city hall.
The city’s capital had called for the event to take place in its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in a very full cultural train station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that are opposite each other.
For each page there is a view screen, in which there are four cards with keywords that you can extract - the old trick with the red foil - only if you have attached it.
So it's ensured that the opposite side can't read anything out of sight.
On the map, for example, you can read from the left to the right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Probably.
"Fest."
These are the concepts that are still valid.
Because the concepts should not be mentioned here, but codes.
A different player per team is the key player.
He gets a code map, which may be "3.4.2".
Errates should be entered in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret sheet, but their encryption code.
His task in this case: he should, in this series and in this example, describe the terms "Wurf", "Fest" and "Window" - and yet his own team would recognize the correct sequences and the opposite team would not be possible; for this would win the party if it hit him twice to break the code.
The locker thus notes and reads aloud: "Water" for the walls, "Loss" as opposed to attachment; of course, there would also be something like "Party" and "Prag" because he has adapted to the school and knows the existing window noise.
That's how it goes around for rounds, team for team.
However, you do not know the concepts of the opposite - but this can be better combined with any indication that the key is there.
It may be mysterious, but it should not be so bad that you make it unnecessary for your team.
The most encrypted of "Decrypto" is the rule rule.
The players may have to study it for a long and thorough time until they can finally play it.
The release video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But the one who has just released will be fascinated by how much feeling is involved in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as closed as predecessors and general-primary "codenames", which also supports an agent thematic on a game of less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about advice and not about sights, who can easily find a version for two of them.
Kulmbach: A man shows the police Hitler size and places guests in the gate
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach on Saturday night.
First he showed the Hitler-Grue in the Upper town of a pre-fabricated police officer, and later he also landed in the Upper city in a knife when he hired other guests.
After clearly alcoholizing the assigned location by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the port cell.
In the next state, he must also be responsible for the use of trademarks of non-conforming organisations.
Business Press was home to the Schubloks.
The railway work in Pressig was the shipyard in Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When the buffer reached the buffer, it was heard in full precision," remembers Georg Dinkel, who records the history of the place and the train station.
No one's supposed to do that.
The brakes were also shut up and the wagons were broken.
That was just the railway.
Statements that make sense for Dinkels Home Pressig.
Nirgendwo in Frankenwald was such a place by the railway.
This was the starting point of the steel rampart hill to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres, has its peak point in Steinbach on the forest.
In order to handle this, early training and training were needed that had their home in Press.
In 1901, the Bavarian land day allowed the construction of a railway station with 21 locches, teaching stations, driving and train workers.
"Herzstück was the triangular ship that had a diameter of 18 metres after a construction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich of Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional travel.
From the railway work (BW) Pressig, which was submitted to Bamberg in 1968, loks were also operated for the nearby Presig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockholm - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported by a staff of 160 men; 13 bombs and eight Ellocks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electricalization of the line 1939 has already minimised the need for train and shelllocks.
Since 1977 they have been used only for goods.
Up to 1991 at least 10,000 roads were repaired.
In 1982, parts of the work were cancelled, in 1991 the rest of the work was cancelled.
Heidrich: "It's sad that you have not taken a better use of the place, even in puncto freight, into your eyes."
Even at Pfingsten 1989, the Nürnberg Railway Directive celebrated a 50-year electrification of Nürnberg - Saalfeld in Press.
"There were 10,000 interested audiences here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were taken away, the Ranger Train Station Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Home Schoolers performed the most difficult work in training," recalls Dinkel.
Each failure had fatal consequences.
Why the Presig Rothenkirchen train station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of both places and many more historical and modern images are available here in the French Plus article.
Kerbere with recording sequence at China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledonsgerin Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegendund have reached the second round at Tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Christina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World War II is Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Then he took 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, who gave the Russians set out in number 13.
The Shivabin is now able to do it with Annet Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened on the weekend under the series "Art and Gains".
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Dahlmann-Smidt, midway bank was opened in the free country of the Dahlmann-Smidt, the special Vernissage "Windplay-performance".
It is located under the roof of the "Rund about Walberla" in the "Art and Genuss" series.
This opened its gates in the 15th year.
A large demand for visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in the middle of the year.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists for opening the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who also made a name as the main organizer and artist.
Something surprising, but Hahn announced his return a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in a secure, young hands with a good future.
Both in the past have been actively involved in the selection of artists and have worked with Flyer.
Also in this year, there is one of the 70 cent special brands designed by art & Genuss, available at each art station.
This year's post can also be designed by Volker Hahn for eight euros.
He enjoyed the high purpose of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical rehearsal.
On the way through the huge garden, it will soon be clear to the visitor that the title "Windsgame performance" is formally challenging the artistic imagination and ultimately leads to the expression.
It is made of metal or ceramics, often with colourful accents.
Already at the start of the stay, the visitors are waiting on the right side of the "happy tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a wooden drum, colored, playful with 20 windmills, 24 ceilings and 24 alu-rooms seen as sound.
With the sun that is passing through the bustle in the background, the object acts as a nightmare and invites it to cancel.
From Eckental, Barbara Waschneck, who prefers the event in three-dimensional letters K&G for 15 years.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On half the street, Siegrid Frey from Eckental released her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his beautiful fantasy pictures of Ton, cement and precious steel.
The theme "Windsgamel performance" is to be highlighted by the diverse art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018 the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50. Birthday fixed
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albanians also made their unmistakably air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find out at all that after the resolution of the church Church, "Cécilia" should no longer be given life in the city.
It has become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they pick up the MGV 68 albums from the pool.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated large in the "house of encounter".
"It's going to be full today," said President Jürgen Holttiege, and he should be right.
150 guests had a real success for the Albanian singers.
In fact, they would have let the Foundation party come back to life.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break first.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II won high-class Derby against BW Aasee

No traces of sceu or frecksans, the independent do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) was really good against city competitors BW Aasee.
"That wasn't clear, but we've already left impressions," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately pointed out: "This is a disaster with which we can live very well.
We're not unhappy." On the contrary.
In the evening at a night birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ran out.
Yes, the result is actually an optical tension.
In the third set, the guests had a satzball.
"If they bring it to the goal, then a game can already kick," says Bürring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine powers, made everything clear and brought the full enjoyment to its goal.
"We all know who's in such a Derby on the other side.
That's not what we're doing.
I've seen a good volleyball at the stage," annacker didn't have the 0:3 and went around the agenda.
Where the journey is going for the independent, it does not seem to be invisible after just three days.
"It's just too early for this," says Axel Büring.
He just feels like, "The 3rd League has an incredible good level.
With regionalga volleyball, this is not nearly comparable."In the fourth league, they do not want to turn their view any further down.
If the westerns are not infected in the coming weeks, they must look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten or eleven parties.
It's the first time you go to Emlichheim on Saturday.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship, Heide Keller became the star.
Now she openly says that the series may have been guilty of her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the Chief Hosts Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Fraumship" was celebrated by Heide Keller (76), but on January 1, 2018 she was always on board.
The series that she was to start could be responsible for her divorced marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could also be a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveling with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my wonderful colleagues took me to the height," says Keller in the conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
At first, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody" but it has changed with the dream ship.
Because now the journalists only call Heide Keller.
"I don't know if that happened to him so well."
It makes it possible that her former husband might have been desperate, but "like many men, he also spoke about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried for Hans of Borsody "the only one who was right and he wanted to know my ancestors, my weaknesses.
That's good English: I've represented myself," she further explained.
She's always had the feeling, "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I had never been in the truth, even though I sometimes appeared happy and courageous.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously divorced marriage to Thomas Hertner, Keller said again yes, "even though I was afraid it could happen a second time."
On the day before the full-fledged trauma, I stood in the garden and wanted to say everything.
He also divorced his wife from Borsody.
Why didn't you get involved with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller showed himself love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not really everyday.
I'm too naive to get into love."
The nightfall, which regularly explores the night of the city in the NZZ-Resort Zurich, has been waiting for the ZFF opening party this time.
Our missing is not a reward, but a little light.
And the green glass, in which a green carpet is covered on the sixth floor, shines over the fee.
But it's a long film festival, because more or less famous people want to sing on stage.
So he cranks at this late dinner table over the place to ease himself in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase" soon.
The public toilet facilities of a large sanitary company, which celebrates their prizes at the festival, are thus called: The need for a new Pavillon party, there is a lot of fun to promote a luxurious environment.
This evening, however, the Lord's oasis is silent for some reason to heaven.
So out here, over on the other side of the street: garnished guests who have just held the "Green Book" opening in the cinema just at the right level, celebrate the beginning of the festival each year with a party in the three-sided shop.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all over the world the works are famous.
What must not be done with an article on this festival in order not to fall into ill-treatment for 190 partners.
The falter binds himself to the feeling that has attached him to a good meal, and two blind doorsters actually look at him in general.
Inside the audiences, they dance long after midnight to live music or let themselves be presented by DJ rhythms, where they shout together, and play with Cüpli exquisite hips below.
In the delicate landscape in the southerrain, Austers wait on slums, in addition to the uneven roses of Culatello di Zibello will be frozen freshly, spraying a chocolate bean.
And the Hammer is: All the sales rules are completely exclusive products have not been extended for the occasion.
That's how it's been for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studies the painting at the roletrack: "Take a long dress, please be careful about the roletrack".
If it were the two separate instructions, he'd gone to the Drescode.
But it is more a conditional construction, and it has already saved lives.
In the budget department in the Upper Coast, the refugees pick up a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", corresponding to the Festival Award.
The price for the best wine is obtained by this mix, which presents itself to a capseller.
And George Clooney, who's been working for the damaged brand for years, is not here tonight either.
However, between local promenades, cassentials and kitchen articles, a face that is familiar to the viewer is Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It should not be far away from its main manufacturer.
And really: Like, Viggo Mortensen spread, with soon almost six times as much as a chorknabe, by the amount.
He won't be accused, he won't be accused, he'll be at the top of the stake.
Good for this back-up, who likes to be misunderstood as a misunderstanding, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbaa dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona rejoices over the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have been well placed in his new home in Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his Dorados de Sinaloa Club, 57 years old trainer with a player in the cabin to Cumbaa-Rythmen, as to be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15th-century clip of a crew member, Maradona dances in the yellowed tricot, burned by the players.

Handball: Connection line 1: ASV Send to Last-Minute Place "on the ground destroyed"
Sven Bieltzki, coach of the US handball-bandlists, could hardly get it: "So a bit lower." His supporters were "damaged on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday at LIT Germany 2.
They did not play bad over large phases, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst.
Only the start phase "we had all gone", the U.S. trainer complained.
Soon, the owners of the house with 8:1, even the early hours that had taken the bicycle, did not bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a rush went through the team," Bieletzki decided the second quarter hour together.
For a break, there were only two more doors in the back.
First of all, the best sentman, Marius Hintze, encountered another time in the phase.
After the change, it was even better from a visit.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst looked out at 15:15, followed by the staphylactor almost passed.
Four minutes before the Sirene, the premise still seemed to delay three attacks (29:26).
And then?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Bieletzki, of course, tends to look for the blame with others.
But: The 120-second penalty, the Stiffen Mühlhoff cast, "was a white".
LIT had been well-laden and suffered four more times to the end – during the last attack by the United States of America.
The boys have fought great, they have also stood well against seven men, and they have always been on empty door again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now you have to get a damn victory here," said the restless Bieletzki.
US Towers: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), by Pol (2).

Elon Musk, founder of the Tesla electric car manufacturer, has lost his tragic defeat as chief of the billion-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-square company.
He and the U.S.B.S.S.S.C.E. directly contributed to a legal dispute over undirected Twitter messages in which the museum could have lost the permission to lead marketed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay every 20 million dollars, and for three years Musk gives the Chairman's office a comparable position to the German supervisory board.

In order to assess Tesla as a whole with 72 billion dollars.
Later, the music returned: Tesla remained at the bar.

The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow against the FC Valencia on Tuesday before the Championships League match.
The former Liverkusen Torhüter Bernd Leno came after an injury to Petr Cech to his first Premier League unit.

Questions: 46% want brands not until 2021 as Chancellor
According to the sources of the past week, the GroKo collects several questionnaires.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel will be critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has taken over the SPD in the Emnid Sunday beach for the image on Sunday for the first time.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD has a figure of 17 per cent, the SPD has a point of 16 per cent compared to the previous week.
CDU and CSU also lose a figure and only 27 percent still come.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the sun.
The greens reach 15 percent, the links 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
On Sunday, the government parties would receive only 43% of the votes in favour.
In this way, the great coalition has now lost most of all the large research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach - on Sunday's question.
The government's parties will reach 43 to 45 per cent of the votes cast (51 per cent).
At the 2017 Bundestag election, they received 53.4 per cent more together.
For the other parties, the band size is also large: The AfD, in several questions, is the second most powerful party, is between 15 and 18 per cent.
The greens reach scores of votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is by average 10 per cent, FDP by 9 per cent.
For statistical reasons, each of these questions has an uncertainty of 2 to 3 per cent above and below according to the vote.
However, the return of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to the population has also been clearly lacking since the federal elections in 2017.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellor, as the Emnide survey revealed in the BamS's order.
Only every second (50 per cent) wants the survey to date that the large coalition will hold up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 per cent are for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there were significant popularity patterns for brands.
The Germans also assess whether Markel should apply for the CDU position again in December.
47 per cent are called Emnide, 44 per cent today.
In the case of Union citizens, 64% wanted a candidate, not 35%.
Age: Price reduction for the success of love
Will Aldi be to Tinder 2.0?
Those who say that in the days of Tinder there is no more romantic familiar stories - which should be held at Aldi once over powdered meat.
München - During the digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the Supermarket plays as a place for the great love almost anachronistic novelty.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pout meat, boxershort buttons on the waltz or the favorites pudding is still a better story for the later single children than just a swipe on the right.
The Tinder app is on the run, less a contact, but more than a sloppy beer.
We've been waiting for the test: How do women react to the first message not long ago around the hot width?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potential has it when the happiness of love presupposes an out-of-eye loss-and-recovered plane.
If the type still reports under the e-mail address bio-puten flesh@gmx.de at its offer, then it will sound very much after Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consortes - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this announcement in an unknown Aldi film that she will also find her dreamman with whom she has recently maintained over the "30 percent reduced bio-punt meat".
For her belief in the magic of the analog scientist, she deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood anyway.

Foßball: Area lying: Researcher Event of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Ageing Makes Mot
There were moments in this young season, since Alois Fetsch went to court with his heart.
He gave himself the coach of the football circuit list VfL Wolbeck, first went back (in) to think about the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it runs around the fireplace again.

After the destruction of Nico Frerichs (moscular problems) - for him, Luca Rehberg - was waiting for it from 4-4-2 almost completely over in a 4-2-3-1, in the Nicla Theves in front of the ball.
Wolbeck clearly had more play parts in the first section.
And Chances.
But Frerichs, before his departure (17) who changed Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38).
At least this would have been the case when the SCA in minute 41 was at the same time in person as Kevin Fullrath and Chris Naberblumer were at risk in front of the Wolbecker Castle - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his business.
After the break, the VfL quickly took full control.

Schroer was also late for 58 minutes at a Thewes Hereen entrance.

And then this: VfL Captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80s. Minutes the lead in the trauma failed at hand.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not allow the gift to go away (79).
A few minutes, Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, first geske in 87 minutes from twelve metres, but still had the victory experience on the pus.
Maybe it was too much of a good thing.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rare
For this reason only 8 per cent of the presidents were female on Saturday 1 September, as described in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented this Monday by the Albright Foundation and presented by the German Press Agency.
"Companys will have to be set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass on to them," said Founding Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely malely owned leadership - with few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The return will make German competitors less numerous, less innovation friendly and more focused on the future.
It's another company culture.
In addition, the small increase in the female share among the German bourgeois companies would only lead to positive incentives in the company's index of the mean value (MDax).
However, according to Allbright, only 6.8% of the presidents are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 per cent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past years, the proportion of women has increased.
Lastly, 26 women worked in the presidents.
"I'm sure that the Dax companies will recruit consecutive women in the coming year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the proportion of "zero percent".
Another picture is shown at the surveillance stations: On September 1, there was a woman's share of 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 men less than a year ago.
"A similar number of women were recruited annually for the presidents, a proportion of 40 per cent would have been achieved in the year 2023," says the report.

Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers buy by car?
With this question, "Autopapst" and Professor of Economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have worked.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made in the first half year with every car sold 69,000 euros - however, Jaguar Land Rover is only around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are even able to drive.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well earned in the race with prices ranging from €33,000 to €38,000 per car and around €3,000.

On Sunday, at which the church party was also celebrated, the union had set the drinking prices as 60 years ago on the afternoon of the anniversary.
A festival for the 60th wine festival will be held on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before a day later in the festival hall in the second round.
In Bonn: Notarztauto power in Taxi
A car is severely damaged along a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was killed in the collision of the vehicle with a taxi.
When notaries are called, they should help - best to save the lives of people.
Such a rescue took place in Bonn, a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been killed in Bonn in the collision of a car with a taxi.
The taxi drivers, the notaries and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notarztato had passed a red bell with blue and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then stood on a cross with the taxi that was at Green.
After the collition, the doctor pushed against a parapet and a tree.
He found out about the passenger who died in the accident.
The driver of the Notary Car and Taxi Hire is seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the notary vehicle were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be released from use forces.
The 29-year-old Notärttin could also free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help them.
Another re-enacted Notarzt tried this - but without success.
The three severe injuries were carried into hospitals.
The police are voting with the Bonner State Administration, who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United lost again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blamming out of the Ligacup, Manchester United loses now in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is 1:3. The type and manner of the download should still be discussed.
The scene was literally in the 74. Minutes in which the repeated Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot at 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had brought Red Devils back to the game.
As they moved an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all the players of Manchester remained, and Arnautovic read all the time of the world, the ball chose by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative height point of a long way out of performance before.
In any case, the municipality is currently in the city of Manchester City, United States.
The citizens trained by the Great Competitor Pep Guardiola against Brighton & Hove Albion came to an unharmed 2:0 victory.
After a half hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team first crossed the border of the outside page.
Sergio Aguero took care of a good hour and a double pass with the pre-safety to ensure the sixth victory in the seventh game, as well as the jump to the table tips.
Liverpool no more table leaders
Three days after the 1:2 Nieldelag in Ligacup, Xerdan Shaqiri and Liverpool fought against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As in the Cup-Aus, Belgium was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hits in the 25-minutes remained until the final stage of the only hits of the game.
Shaqiri, who arrived in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah in the field, spent 70 minutes on the balance even closer.
Daniel Sturridge did better in 89 minutes with his sclenzer.
So after the talks started with an endless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be hit the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and through the remiss in the League, the Blues Liverpool was still the top of the table.
Like City the two London City Clubs also celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal ( against Watford) 2:0-winge.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played, however, had to wait until 81 minutes for a successful message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the closing, Watford-Verretaire Craig Cathcart had an accident at Alex Iwobi's own door, only two minutes later Mesut Özel, with his third season's decision.
Arsenal went through the fifth victory in follow-up to Watford and is again right behind the great Rivalen Tottenham on Rank 5. A strong impression is still left under the rising Volverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Spirito Santo.
The Wolves remained at 2:0 against Southampton in the League for the fifth time in the sequence of the 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris car salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet at the same time: The diesel channel and the rail line for road bans and trailers should not be released by the German automotive companies at the Paris meeting.
At the 2018 car salon, they show their news from next week together with competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and subsequent offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be dealt with with by the government in Berlin, must still be an important subject at least behind the shining cults of the exhibitions.
A large name is missing in Paris: The People's Car Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW core brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes Benz are there and, among other things, they have their first pure electric models: The E-tron of the Ingol cities is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Officially presented, but both of them have already been present.
The iNext of BMW should start only 2021.
At the centre of Paris is the new 3rd.
All over this year, from 4 to 14 October, more than 250 exhibitors have been represented.
In addition to car companies, motor vehicle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The event, which celebrates this year's 120th birthday, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 a million visitors arrived.
At least 380 people have come to life on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi and the following tsunamis.
Thousands are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injuries.
On Friday, the island was devastated by two earthquakes.
The first bebe had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communications and transport connections have been damaged, resulting in huge damage.
After the bees the Tsunami brought back over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the charges will still go significantly.
The numbers come from only Palu.
However, there are also many other communities - along the Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate God’s service in Verdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne has celebrated the final service on Sunday with an auxiliary team for the motorcycle driver in the Peace Circle in Eveking.
Werdohl - The place before the peace circle in Eveking was the motor driver on Sunday.
The final service for the bikers was always on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor Pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfallen and is responsible for the health care of the strong two-way PSs.
Between April and September, the last Sunday is the last month of the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at the house of Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by the Bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to share everything other than regular service to God.
For about 10 hours, the Bolides had been busy in front of the church’s entrance portal.
At first, the Biker breakfasts were on the program, and it needed to be strengthened with coffee and kitchens or even with a funky currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also involved.
The preaching took place during the Bicker Goods Service of Pfarer Dirk Grzegork.
The Singer-Songwriterin Valerie Lill provided for the musical interpretation.
"While the bikker prefers the blue rock, Valerie Lill strikes more poetic-stupid tone," said Pfarer Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Fücktor's home is a big party: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared appetizers.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also developed a great interest.
He had his appelpresses in the bag and demonstrated his standing audience step by step the process from the burning app to the appetizer.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg passed the children through the field and filled them with the apples in the big trees.
With a little muscle strength, a fine circled mass was formed from the apples.
Still, many of the children could not imagine how this should be a tasteful drink.
However, they were also able to see this important step of work on this late Friday.
In forms packed and surrounded by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg set up a little bit like heckle-like shells for each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step is no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice grew into a large cup of coffee.
However, the Führer had already completed specificities.
So he opened his "Schatzkiste" and presented the oldest visitors to the latest federal whites.
The demand for the good troupe "Made in Füchtorf" was considerable.
In a pleasant atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of the appelpress, but also the built-in Hupfburg for themselves.
Also active by Fücktors Cameradschaft former soldiers engaged in short-term games within the framework of the fortress and played at some stations.
In the coming year, the home will be offered one day of action.
Then, however, as Gregor Krütz battled, it will not be the househouse in the heart of the spargel village of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the theme on hand: Finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 v. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season: "Good situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga Néederlage near each other, Coach André Breiterreiter gathered his enchanted profession from Hannover 96 to speak to them with courage.
However, there were many positives to see at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Frankfurt entrance.
"It's a closed situation, but you have to get out of there as a man," said 96-football professor Pirmin Schwegler and said, "that's kind of amazing, because you're always taking too much."
The further winning Dutchs, for which only Florent Muslija (86) has come to an end, are with two figures all down, and are a candidate in their current constitution.
Introduced by the surprising Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season.
Evan Oite Ndicka in the 36 minutes, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89.) drew 46,300 visitors to the DFB pocalic winner who, following the successful general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome, predicted seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice-Montenegro Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of horses and never to get caught by Hannover Abbehr.
After the WM, the storm showed with its time and means of passing, why it is so valuable for the entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, released by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the formation of Frankfurter, which began to smellfully.
Lucas Torró (17) was first in danger.
Six minutes later, Sebastien Haller was stopped in a visible position at the last minute of the 96th anniversary of the Brazilian flag, which replaced the short-term Kevin Winter (Back).
The leadership for the household lords was almost severe and worth it.
Filip Kostic took the ball after an abandoned corner in the courtyard, Haller extended by head before the door, where Indicka just needed to keep the foot.
It was the first federal contribution to the AJ Auxerre, the French double-lister in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still waiting for the break.
This time Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who was able to think over and 96-day Michael Esser had no chance.
In the middle of the year, Hannover-Coach shared in the weak presentation of his elephant and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive powers.
However, the Dutch people were now playing something more courageous in the past, and they were still going on to the end.
The horses were much more efficient.
After a couple of hours, Rebic started a solo and then put it on De Guzmán, who just had to shoot the ball into an empty door.
The rest was only for the Frankfurter against the displaced guests, and Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square will become a partyroom
Despite cold temperatures, it was a great mood at the October festival in the city.
The Münchener Oberburgermeister Dieter Reiter created it in front of millions of audiences at the opening of 185.
München Wies' in the last week with two beds.
Christmas: Christmas Christmas Celebrations Saint-Creez-Fest
The religious Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on 14 September or on Sunday.
The Constituent Church is located in the city church, followed by a process for the Holy Church with its end readings.
The Holy Creuz Church houses the shot Christ, who is from the 30th century war and who has been shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flows out of the shell.
From this, a great wall developed for the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross.
This is not finished until today, just the altar room, the missing house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, trust and life.
The service of God was bad in spite of the importance of the dangerous pharaohs.
After the service of God, the process of the Holy Cross took place, and with the end of the church, the church part of the cross was finished.
For many years, the Catholic Church has been praying for the world part of the festival in the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided visitors with delicious meals and a large selection of kitchens and the weather, a farm hall.
On the afternoon, the Pfarr community is still taking guidance around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmidt victory, informing visitors about the damages to fassad, roof, sandworks and windows, as well as the ongoing construction measures that will continue until the next year.
After the army has been in place for some time, the damages could be precisely identified and the individual statements could be prepared more precisely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existed a few years ago has become greater, but it has also been more determined, which is only possible through the introduction of weapons.
Sockelverputer's work is completed, before winter is to begin with the works of nature, and it is still well hoped that half of these work can be completed this year.
Accommodation: New residence in the New Ulmer Münsterlickstraße
The life-saving Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münster view.
That "a very special house" will now be handed over to the Münsterbickstraße - as all residents were satisfied at the time of accession.
Finally, until recently, the twelve roulettemen who have been living in the home of the life-help Donau-Iller have been living for some time on the special architecture of the new building.
More gangs, rivers and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have taken into account Architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the front for the residents with a phonecap: "The house had arrived in the years and no longer in the equipment", Bader pointed back.
In 2016 the baker turned to rent the house.
The Neubau should be designed as friendly and as light as possible so that the inhabitants can feel that way, such as the architect.
Life-help Donau-Iller opens new housing
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in the Neubau.
The Freestat paid EUR 2.4 million to the area of Swaben EUR 450,000.
The construction works are, according to Architekt Bader, in the planned framework - both timely and financially.
He also thanked him for his life-saving business leader, Jürgen Heinz.
Spagat was not always easy between a barrier free and simultaneously fireproof construction.
However, the planners and manual workers had built a home with many purposes, which allowed the inhabitants to experience freedom to move even without help.
Similarly, the director of the social administration of the region Swaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house focuses on the special needs of its inhabitants, who need the resources to be mobile."
In order to be well combined with viability and functionality, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The basic thing in this situation is a real accident, because it is not to be acquired in the present situation anymore."
In total, the new residence in the Münsterbickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three groups.
Stolz is a Lifesaving Director of Heinz on the eleven full-time forces that have been appointed at all costs.
Germany: Swwessi accuses differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unity, the deputy SPD-Bundsierman Manuela Schwesi called on all the people of the country not to find themselves with the participation of East Germany.
There are differences that affect unit after almost 30 years.
With these differences we cannot satisfy ourselves," Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said the "day mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent less money.
"I can't explain that almost 30 years after the German unit," Swiss said.
North Korea: Does this filthy dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jigdhunt is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to break the ties to Seoul, Pjungjang gave the South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan jigdungs.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two dogs had reached their recipients on Thursday about a year ago.
They then passed the Panmunjum border with three kilograms of dog feed to ease the animals' "encourage".
The dogs with the thick white fold, thick ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national culture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The company had announced to the north at the third summit this year between the moon and the North Korean Maxthaber Kim Jong Un mid-September in Pjungjang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the Olympics 2020 and compete together in 2032 for the Austrian Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also wanted to close the test facility Tongchang Ri for rocket acquisitions.
History moved by Austria in the mirror of 99 documents
What's Austria?
To the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this memorial year for almost ten months, many new books have appeared that have been answered mostly over the past hundred years.
On the other hand, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archives, is presented in Austria's famous "Imagebook" which will appear on October 1.
New weeks, new opportunity for government
Back to work - so the informal motto for today's beginning working weeks of the Great coalition.
Not a interview, not a speech in which the Chancellor and its ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not mantraly claim the "return to business".
This may have caused some workers, doctors, nurses and other professional citizens in this country to question the right question, which is actually the difference between work and business, but it is true.
If the Federal Government is now so far, once again to turn its mandate - to the government - it should not be stopped by the debate on this matter.
If the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and criticisms of the last few weeks, it will be possible to show it on Monday.
At night, the tops of the government parties will be brought together to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to invite these rounds on a regular basis to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the conflict.
First, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel equipment and the law of professional immigration.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies with exchange premiums light up, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to monitor the technical recovery of older diesels.
The Union and the SPD are still very closely involved in the planned expert migration legislation in the case of the diesel crisis over the past week.
The SPD requires a life-saving perspective for retired asylum-seekers who work or make training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "spur change" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be a fight again among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has been combined to Groko, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
Street's good.
Without conflict, a society that has not developed such a diversity of interests, but that is contrary to the interests of the society.
In order to be constructive, however, the struggle must not be renewed for participatory reasons on the issue of itself or not.
It's still about politics, not about theater.
The Union and the SPD are going to fight - but they always have the lives of people in mind.
What's makeable and useful to many?
With this question of guidance, both the diesel and the spray exchange question can be pragmatically cleared - and so on.
In particular, the people's parties must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visit
Does the Minister of Labour judge against the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Actually day and night" had worked with their legislators on social security reform, reported an excessive social minister at the presentation two weeks earlier.
At the list-Pilz-Mandarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beata Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is being made surprising - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament through a request.
She concludes that "the Minister only wanted to express his interest in the use of his team and, in any event, did not want to report any damage to the right of service before running cameras".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to "responsibility to speak out of any suspicion".
The police are looking for women's bodies on a street
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to be out there.
There's a confirmation now.
Since early Saturday morning, the state street between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is still closed in the Marxgreen area until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had used an archeology dog before.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide in multiple use, was finally able to limit the relevant position to a few meters.
In addition, along with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian memorial protection authority in the area of the affected road section, a landan anomaly was discovered.
For more than a year, State administration and criminal police have been working on the missing.
In Marxgrün, a railway was stopped and tested with sonar devices because the investigators suspected that there could be a disturbance in the construction of the state street 30 years ago by Heike's body.
Colorful powders and eggs: Crews in Barcelona before Catalan anniversary
On Monday, the conflict of independence referendum will be held for the first time in Catholics.
But it's already gone to Krawalen.
The separatists have not forgotten the police presence since the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - just before the anniversary of the Catalan Independent referendum of 1 October 2017, a meeting between the separatists and the police was held in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalonian security forces were attacked, inter alia, by the independence advocates, with color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of national police and civil security.
About 3,000 officers of the police units Policía National and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who had been in use during the last year as a illegal referendum in the elections.
When trying to stop citizens from voting, it was also violent.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the around 6,000 separatists had then tried to break the police codes, and the officers, among others, had been attacked by colored bullets and eggs.
Six persons have been arrested, 24 more have been slighted, it has been applied to the authorities.
On Monday, the independent referendum is the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to terminate the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid, Catalania, in the autumn of 2017, was subject to forced administration.
The former Regional President, Carles Puigdemont, flew into Exil to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December the region of Neuwahlen was arrested.
Following the administration of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra is also on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Fußball: Upper Westfalls: Collected bad luck: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torlos
Red-white sharks are still on the ground.
Also at the FC Güterslog it only refers to a 0:0-unless.
The final light and the third party drew up 438 visitors in the Heidewald Stadium as a collection of councillors.
The first half was transparent from the maintenance factor.
Anyone who wanted to take a beer or a brothel could do this without fear.
It was not the risk of losing a torchance, because it didn't actually happen.
First check after half an hour
For the first (harmless) torture of the whole party, Nick Flock was appointed responsible in the 28 minutes.
The best - and in principle also only - could have been the chance of the ahlenders, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG Tower Frederic Westergerling was forced out of a parade after 32 minutes with a shock from the brake limit.
Even worse were the guests.
Their most effective action was in an early exchange.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be compensated for the damage, for whom Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing long distances.
In the 48 minutes, Sebastian Mützel, 18 meters above the house, and after an hour, the good-byers were first openly exposed.
After a balleroping by Matthew Wieckowicz it went fixed.
The newly proposed counter about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a slight shock in the army of RWA-Towert Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they left with a headball by Wieckowicz (66.) after an ex-Aleoner Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interemstrainer Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority, thanks to their own initiative, the athletes did not stand.
First in 91 minutes, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did he bring anything.
Angelo Dout tried to pull out the positive: "I like that we've played at zero." But unfortunately, the zeros were also ahead.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Holwichde and although our opponent had no desire to play here," observed RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Offensive "placed everything so a bit" against a team, which just wanted to protect.
I didn't have the feeling that we could get an agent," he said.
However, as an observer, he did not have the feeling that his team could shoot a door.
That was a good idea.
Recycling fields Erttendank market: There are plenty of creamers for luck
The pleasure of Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafeleusgericht, for which these expenses are determined.
The officials will ensure: "These expenses remain also in Reckenfeld".
The sky appeared glowing blue, the place was still empty, but it should change in the course of the day.
Because, "This is so beautiful, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
The founder of the firm, Franz Josef Holthaus, welcomed the guests at the Kiopenkerl Outfit as always with a good price Humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be considered to be food, short-lived Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer started.
The Verena (the daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are already enough Kreimers.
And the "Erastz" was not allowed to keep the visitors more and more musically.
That was so good that a few folk songs were met after hours.
"It's just great," happy Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vnemeyer was able to extend the opening term this time to his term plan.
He is happy about the many assets with their positions, including over-the-countered units.
"In fact, it should not be given as much as a table," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stations and finally the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a beautiful ring - here's what's going on.
Then George Knorr and Gerd Klück took the maikranz with the help of the fire and was taken to the winter quarter.
In many places it was worked for the local welfare.
It was all to have.
Stefan Hammeyer, who has lived in Reckenfeld for the first time in a year, has been creative on his deposition side.
Furniture work, beer cover with reckenfelder Motives and some more he had in his offer.
A specialty is covered by three rain fields of imker: "reckenfelder Honig", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershawn and Helen Roth-Buschlütter.
Finally, there is still a special feature.
Honigkuchen in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Since the little Elsa had to get back, the kitchen was so good.
The company is the one who has allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until evening hours, even without a program that does not exist at the ceremony.
Chimneys with local political message: No successful publication for disaster facilities
In Lösch, the unknowns have certainly hardly acquired a useful way to build a disaster facility.
Jürgen Kohne from the city administration says on a request from the UN.
In at least one case, the police have been punished for damages.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lülberich" are used on paintings, including at the Gempt Hall and at the old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, the manager of the Hall, reports that a corresponding letter was discovered on September 19 after the job exchange on September 19.
Since the short message has been left open "only" with an Edding in its time, they have been able to be removed without trouble.
"Some days later, however, it stopped again, this time it woke up," said Rottmann.
It is clear that the relevant trade mark has to be replaced.
A special note is only this case because several large companies from Lüberich are also listed on the table.
If the disaster facility is built, it should also be made possible by sponsors.
In addition, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the city's professional field of school, sport and culture, without names.
But it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the frozen table.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of disaster management.
After the old LWL clinic was built, after some time the search began for an alternative location.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly for the fireplace.
This view has not been translated - to many factors seem to speak against building at this point.
At the end of June, he was followed by a rehearsal.
The members of the Main Committee and the Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne tells the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city square.
It is a decision this year, so it could be built on a positive vote 2019.
Adapting to air traffic will make it even worse.
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European Air Traffic Chaos in summer, the German airlines do not see signs of improvement in the coming year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the head of the airline's operations, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the air traffic disaster on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the many delays and accidents is the well-known staff note in European aviation insurance, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training of new fleets takes four to five years," said the trader.
Europe has been taught the market for finished-trained lotes.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas once again criticized the fact that various air transport companies were not invited to the summit.
In Hanse City, representatives of the Federation, the countries, the aviation security, the Airlines and the airports come together on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work coverage and overtime, it won't go without us," explained GdF chief, who has many members at the German Federal Aviation Agency.
Maas was again responsible for the EU Commission's tasks for the fleets.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running up to 2019 were too low.
The costs and staff savings resulting from this are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply in Brussels for regulations that "the air will not be closed any longer".
The EU budget would now be adopted by 2024 and further distortions would be feared.
The EU has been constantly exposed to lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair-Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now learned exactly what they've done themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high memory costs will lead to a change in flight companies.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Aviation Protection (DFS) offers a "smooth training and future package", Maas said.
The announcements made by 120 lottery students over the next five years are just enough to match the age-limited departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet linked to this.
Thyssenkrup display board approved for group numbering
The members of the Thyssenkrup Supervisory Board voted in favour of the Group's building plans.
Following the will of the head of the Council, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed on Sunday at the meeting of the President of the Board, the crisis groups should be split into two separate companies.
Both companies should have their seat in food and be notified at the pool.
An additional staff building should not be provided in addition to the already known cuts in the administration.
After two returns, the control gremium on the capital page is only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are against it.
The final decision, however, is expected to take place in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrup Materials AG should include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner tab.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be financed with supplies and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence against Demos by police and Catalan independence advocates.
At the same time, two demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have given severe asylum regulations with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independent protesters showed up.
The catalytic police have tried to keep both protests from one another.
According to the use force, however, independent claimants repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They had attacked the officers with color and noise.
There were also discussions between the participants of the various protests.
According to statements of rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Improving the behaviour and appreciation of colleagues
The police wanted with their demonstration the colleagues who had passed the independence referendum against the Spanish Central Government almost a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers are more valuable than they are.
The demonstrators accepted it as a provocation that the Spanish police were justified in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan Democrat Manuel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have threatened us a year ago.
A 31-year-old cop from the Balearicians who only wanted to give his name to Daniel showed back the draft.
"Of course, we want to support our cameras who have only done their duty last year: protect the law," he said.
But the demonstration is to exercise our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a great European city and there is more to it.
But he and his colleagues were "not here to try," the police assured him.
Panne allowed access to personal data from the British Minister
A security accident at a phone app has led to the availability of personal data by ministers and officials of the conservative British Tory Party on Saturday for everyone.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the panic was announced one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Football: Juve trainer dances by top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese Star Stormer "has played the best game this evening with half an hour of Valencia," Juve-Coch Massimiliano Allegri praised the score teacher against the SSC Neapel after 3:1 (1:1).
For the trainer, the expensive star was also without the man's own door in the important party against the persecutors.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did it well," said Allegri.
Even when we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door - and we grew up from the moment.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three torpoises, Juve turned the game after the early retreat through the encounter of Tries Mertens (10. minutes) and stopped the worst pursuer first.
The former Bundesliga Prof. Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double package (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a ecke per headball, also carried out the pre-trial work to be carried out by Professor Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had just had to change before the Torline.
"There are many suggestions," said the trainer.
Of course, Allegri also wants to see Tore from the attacker who is both in the League Championships and in the Portuguese national team of record protection.
"We need to get even better there to serve him," the coach asked.
The best juve protection is now Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to be even more impressive.
Seven Wins in seven games make the single series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the remaining seven years has already had six numbers in advance on Neapel.
However, the table width of the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti trained by the former Bayer-Coach was not chanceless against the tour.
But later on after the announcement of the already alarmed Mario Rui (58) the party was chosen.
The Portuguese had to fight hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the place.
"We have played well against a good neapel," commented the Turner Coach.
The conversation also made Emre Can feel that way.
The German national player has engaged in Juve.
The profile from the FC Liverpool was used in all seven Liga parties.
The middle floor editor also played in the champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying at 2:0 victory of the tournament from the place and was stopped for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changed his name
With a particularly shocking event, Rapper Kanye West has been providing the "Saturday Night Live" show on the weekend for attention.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil pump was in a mineral water costume for starlines and frescoes in visitors.
The 41-year-olds also announced a change in name to publish his new albums.
You can still call him "You", so the musician.
"The Beings, formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted instead of the deceased singer Prince, as this artist named him.
The pseudonym, however, is not a novelty.
The tenth album has already appeared under this name.
In an interview with the Radiosender KRL, the artist had declared that "Yes" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "du", so the rapper.
Football: Creisliga A1 Pattern: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not make any hell out of his enthusiasm.
That was a tough game for us today.
The opponent was simply more griffer, we put him as well as never before."
Size two torcancers in 90 minutes, so only rare games can be developed positively.
Football Crossing A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Shipping Horst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options for the first time, but the first used Mike Krause from a thick angle for early driving (7.).
In the 43 minutes, Steffen Uphus would have been able to increase, but after the excellent processing of Krause, he understood that he was free.
The guests had only had a double chance as Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher first and also found his master in the offspring of Jan Flower in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61), and Heinz Linnemann (69).
A commercial meter - Louis Cortenjann had saved on the Torline with his hand and saw for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use the guests (75).
First as Nil Beredie saved the ball over the line, the party was chosen (81.).
"We had been critical of us before, then it was different today than in the last few weeks," said the facit of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, May, Kraus, Krause (77. Beredie), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.

Football: Creisliga A2 Pattern: Spectacular Football in Albachten: GW Albersloh belongs to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what I'm supposed to do," he said.
"We don't even have access to it." He must have thought of flying with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green stars that meet with collective offensivdrange.
However, Lachen could say, "A drinker victory," he still said, curiously, and moved from those of his players to notice that they had taken three points out of the race.
Well-marked, after a couple of men, one of whom plays the mastership, and the other, Albersloh, fighting for the class content.
With understanding mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best season performance," he says.
"How we got back after 0:2, how we kept up against one of the top men of the League over the entire game, which was really phenomenal."
So more and more it works that you have to go home with empty hands now.
Top tourr Lars Zymner brought the host with his 12th season gift in charge (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this tower.
The 2:0 placed on the left side a pattern for Fabian breakfast (39.).
We knew it, but such a player can't keep it completely out.
"It was already a war, what he has done," Lewandoski acknowledged the quality of the enemy without delay.
Shortly before the change of page, his own Elf created the equation: McGill's freestoß from left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe from the long toreck (45).
After the change of page, it was again McGill, who designed the comparison (59).
Then it went in and here.
It was a childish, action-loaded game.
Nübel shot Albachten again (64). Only five minutes later did Patrick Horstmann (69).
Despite the excess, Albersloh no longer managed to reconfirm the last Concordia transfer (80.).
We must now adjust our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against shoes, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tower: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Breakfast (39), 2:1 McGill (45), 2:2 McGill (59), 3:2 Nübel (64), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80).
Gelb-Rot: Atalan (74/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fighting point against Primus
No winner has given it in the country wage between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: The entire presidency of Dynamo Dresden
The entire Presidium of Football-Zweitlist Dynamo Dresden has been returned to media reports.
A number of media agree on a joint letter from the section of the case.
At first, there was no confirmation of the Union.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal combat against former federalists.
Erdogan in Germany: Politicians instead of Pomp
It's good that he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departures in Germany provide such great relief as those of Recep Taiyip Erdogan.
Three days was the Turkish President in Berlin and Cologne to guest, and many had meant that he should not even be invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Popular Guests and New Offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers some 80 meetings up to the middle of the next year.
For this reason, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, has notified himself that he wants to buy the tolerance price in Tutzing personally.
For Christian Wolff, the time of office was too short: he was not in the Tutzings of Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wolff was there for a guest.
So he was asked by academic director Udo Hahn, when he said proudly, "All the federal presidents and the federal Chancellor were already with us." That the academics in Tutzing were always re-prominent, but there was also a theme in the presentation of the annual programme.
At a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophic perspective at the end of October, author Friedo Man is a writer at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, has also said: He wants to take the "Toleranz price" paid by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which is also available in another category by TV moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 meetings up to mid-1919 are in place.
"The interest is not safe even!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS to Europe's borders" - so the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route over the Mediterranean".
"And at a meeting on Syria: "Barbarii without limit."
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war hates every human idea."
From structural racism in society over the scars between arms and power to radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academie Director Hahn convinced himself: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to seek solutions or at least to find solutions."
At a meeting at 200.
The day of Karl Marx's birth was first expected by a more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, others more than a trend "from left to right".
How does it look with neutrality?
"We are about 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Country Church," said scholar Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music Charter: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - West Falcon News
"Regarded both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday at the Hall of Christuskirch in Wolbeck.
As a Cabaretist, Teubner had a sexual understanding, not only with humor and a warm heart for the (sensitive) woman and (feeling) men and what else could be given, but also with music.
The mini-gitterre set her up and raised her violin.
I'm flying in Ben Süverkrüp.
It is for one of the male sponsors, who comes to the conclusion of the sentence, for the other, a true pianist: So royally, the superkrüp Teubner joins the Süverkrüp Teubner that some have wanted a solo.
That's also true, with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, as it turned into the red dinner of the night.
There Teubner had brought into play a paradoxon: The satisfaction of a man, if he had a partner, did not open this door.
A closed door without a partner does not bring any benefits.
The piano-solo now demonstrates itself: What would come from the composition of Mozarts, "the Nannerl" would have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, supercrust in improvisations, from Bachs "O chief full of blood and veins" into the "play of death", and from Mozart g-Moll-Symphony in a playful dance.
There was a great appeal and "Bravo" from the whole room.
Flowers passed by Karlheinz Kleintje, chatzmaster of the Union, the Chancellor.
However, the president of Heidemarie Markenbeck was unable to accept an additional thanks.
She also had the idea of sending the duo next to the exhibitions in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The conflicting tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain the head of the executive board at Tesla's electric car manufacturer, but the Board of Directors must resign.
Musk agreed with SEC's U.S. Bronze Review to pay a double million fine, as the SEC announced.
The background is the amazing announcement of the August to take Tesla from the Bourse.
The SEC was guilty of making false and misleading statements in its complaint.

After a bus crash on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have adjusted the charges slightly below.
It would have been 10 instead of 15 passengers easily injured.
All were released from the hospital.
The French bus driver stayed for a night in the hospital.
He'll be released during the day, said a police speaker.
The reason for the accident of the bus in Brussels is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the train was stationed at the front of a guide plane.
Handball: Women's Country League: Ahlender SG holds against TV Watershed button the white west
Problems were mainly with third-party player Carolin Stallmann, who marked only ten hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the break, only one player has made too many towers.
We haven't got them in the Griff," says ASG-Coch Dougan Aydogdu.
But he was more concerned about the many opportunities left.
The concentration in the conclusion left his husband to lose this time.
The ASG therefore loved almost to the end of a retreat, left the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45).
Only against the end did the wider bank of the guests make a decisive note.
In addition, Aydogdu restored Merle Klement to the left-hand side, which then made "extreme clever the decisive tower" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buskötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Women's League: Top of the East BSV in the top game at VC Allbau Food
Thanks to a top priority in the game, the volleyballs of the BSV East defend have again been established in the 3rd Liga West top group.
For double-sized VC Allbau Food the blue-whites won with 3:1.
"It was a giant step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We've developed this now," Coach Dominik Münch rejoices after a nearly endless performance of his man in the controlled table manager.
The first pass dominated the guests almost after their favorites.
At 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice president of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has been adopted in the second round, but it has not come into play.
We've worked them well.
Our opponent has raised a high risk, but also produced a number of driving cards.
In the second sentence, the BSV has already led with 12:8. "The food has changed the adoption on three lines.
We couldn't hold on to the pressure.
Food's got a lot of trouble, and we've got a bit of crying," Münch continues.
At 18:17, the volleyballers from the Ruhr area first had the nose.
On the other hand, at 19:24 four other seats were left, but the fifth attempt was to reach its goal.
"The game was now a better class," said the teacher to the growing level.
Mike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge were involved in their claims that the BSV used the sheet in the third section of the section of 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We have followed and played quietly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue whites carried through four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen to be the most valuable player, but Maren Flechmeier had also been elected for a preliminary day.
BSV-Frauds: Home, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mercsch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Moscow opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the Great Dibi-Mosche in Cologne was brought into existence by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a screen hall in the German-Turkey relationship, which can only be combined in a way," said the President of the TGD, Gökya Sofuoglu, the German editing network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, sedentary approach.
"Where the party with German top politicians undermines the presence of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the term for its purposes," Sofuoglu said.
The extensive conclusion of the German public has "increased many reservations".
Home Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally a folktreff time.
On 18 October (Donerday) at 19.30 a.m., the housematverein Nottuln is already holding its fifth Nottulner folk event in the old office room.
Just on the day, it's a year ago that we've been performing a census for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become a solid part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," happy Hans Moormann, president of Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our people were going so fast in Nottuln.
No matter whether it was a storm of Friederike in January or Hetzewelle in July, the office room was always fully occupied.
"The program is always a great mix of German folk, wanderers and seamen's leaders, folkongs, evergreens and old soldiers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who calls again and again to Notttun.
To the first folktreff "Birth Day" Klaus Spillmeyer entered his accordion.
He was a member of Gaitling for many years, a group from nearby Steinfurt, who played music with platinum German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
Gern remembers the artist of the folktref at the last event in the summer, as Christoph Schulz from the folktreff Emsdettet with his international composition of the song "Fresh in the night" and sent the audience to the house with an ohrwurm.
"We count on many happy guests to spend a quiet and humorous night again," it says in the invitation of the home.
Anyone who plays an instrument and has fun to actively engage is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there for a while.
The public strike starts at 19.30 a.m., but the opening is already at 19 a.m.
China approved planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are making further progress on the way to the world's largest industrial companies.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the planned merger, shared Linde on Sunday.
This makes it possible for the billions of difficulties still to be met in South Korea and - as the largest host - in the United States.
Finally, the chances of an inside approval were improved because Linde has offered the sale of additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open issues must be clarified until 24 October in order to reduce merger.
From pure fruit-building to the environment
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old residence of the circuit association for garden construction and landscapes was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with an eye on the Kultmbacher United Kingdom, the last foundation simulation was set for the circuit association for garden construction and landfilling Kultmbach, and 125 years later he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kultmbach City Hall on Saturday.
At the time, he was free to take another look: as "Course Buildings in Kulmbach City and Country" he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa 1893.
The purpose of the plant was also different from today's work - it really went clean about the plant building, about flowers and gardening, and nobody thought about it at the time.
"At that time, in the era of the declaration, the fruit tree was a favorite daughter of the elites," Kreishimatpfleger Günter Dippold declared in his festival contract.
Fruit trees should be planted by remote routes, so-called industrial measures were set up in schools.
The building is still the task of 55 garden construction units in the Kulmbach district, which includes nearly 7,000 members.
However, this does not create the spectrum at all.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village recreation and food play a similar role as the means of knowledge, healthy food and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwürffe" showed the role of a garden builder in many ways.
"Young people's work is particularly urgent in the digital age," said the Creis president Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences are in nature for life.
The catalytic collection was a big issue for us children, I doubt that you can collect much joy with smartphones and Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees along with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the circle bond decides," Landrat Söllner added, and stressed the special importance of garden construction for the villages.
The circle bond is for the environment, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real case of many gardening companies in the countryside also left no doubt about this was the case with circular business leader and professional consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led many visitors with an image project through the long history of the circle connection and reported, inter alia, the need for self-sustainment after the war.
Earlier everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was slaughtered.
At the end of the 50s, however, the useful gardens have turned into a steel and residential garden.
"The nature has a body, it was already before us and we have to focus on it," said the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, it gives the garden builders the opportunity not to give up their passions so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, complemented by the president of the Baerish Country Federation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the exciting return to insects, which we are responsible for our children and individuals," Günter Reif concluded with the winning festival, which was celebrated by the drummers of Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta Talks: Canada Foreign Minister leaves UN-Red
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters of Nafta: they make both trading partners an ultimatum for agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now accords the trade agreement with absolute priority - and communicates it to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time on the Rings of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Christia Freeland has moved their talks at the UN general debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the Minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations plenary meeting, she shared with her speaker Adam Austen.
In the meantime, they focus on the re-treatment of naphtha.
The Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, had announced on Friday that the negotiations leaders of Canada and the United States would have been 48 hours of time if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
In August, the United States and Mexico had agreed to a renewal of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump pointed out that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The discussions on a new platform have been held for over a year.
Until Sunday afternoon they are to be brought to a conclusion, Trump's Government wants to present the agreement before 1 October before the US Senate.
For the case of a negotiating schedule, Mexico's appointed President, Andres Manuel López Obrador, had announced on Friday that he would work for a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in an attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lived after a report of the "O Globo" newspaper.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-years will be held in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil on open roads.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele noun" (in German: "The Not"), women had specifically called protests against the ex-Military.
In the social networks, the links against Bolsonaros also made racist and feminine statements mobile.
In the São Paulo Metropolis, thousands of demonstrators were expected.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests were met with a competition from the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He refers to the position of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years of corruption and therefore cannot apply.
The presidential election in Brazil is October 7th.
As former mayor of the Millionenstadt São Paulo, Haddad was in questioning for a long time behind the six-year-old Bolsonaro candidates.
Although the "Trup Brazilians" has been dealing with politics for a long time, it is now being presented as an anti-system candidate.
None of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is a vote on October 28.
Please note that Bolsonaro will not be successfully removed from this, however, against who he is.
Bolsonaro is known for his honouring against homosexuals and blacks and the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked again with false explanations.
On another occasion, he said that the employees of Lucas left working party should be shot.

The musician has been treated since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen became known as the band Gasolin, which was very successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the resolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold in Denmark around three million plates.
His album "Midt per night" from 1983 to today is the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "strategic," which "was against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government recalled that the monarchy-Gegner Larsen 2010 was present on the 70th birthday of the Danish King Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Sound strength on the pressure air temperature level
"Here we stand, take the bones and sing a concert table with the power of a tiger."Only the names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" include such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday at the Hall of the City Centre Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure by three other friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace from Lampenfeeber.
Then the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the environment - all in connection with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loud enough to see about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The "Tiger Bonesaw" quarter with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows about the recording of the concert tab also with the latest, unknown items from his own feds and the CD that appeared first.
In front of the stage, the band is drawn to a sound and impressive combination of the band.
Although "Zugabe" noises are not to be overcome, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Lord We Stand".
The hardrock is not the same as the hardrock, showing guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierenrich at the bass and scaffolder Kai Hölscher with its alternative, double to classic rock, which reminds us of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of "Tigers" comes at "Lord We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesiser is also used.
Not only is the visible, just balladed "Take Me Home" consisting of the exchange of melodic Passages to the guitar-loaded rockifs of many songs.
The 4th "The Ignition" from Tönnishhöchen has since its founding in 2005.
Full agility presents the band on Saturday their hardcock.
The "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a movie by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - has a special stage experience, is obvious and unforgettable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann is also playing with the band at the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, all his accents.
To feel even higher controlled sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejuvenated solo, where he runs through the public.
A certain sound strength is essential at such a simple hardware concert, of course: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the sound of the mixpult team comes from the three concert "Her We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is about the pressure level, but it is still clear under the pressures of the "Waken Festival" on the "The Ignition" on its website.
At least 120 decibels in dicentri-bleed strengths, such as the annual metal stedelichine in the north of the Republic, do not need the ahlener public during this rock night.
After about four hours, the three bands of the tough, rocky gang have long convinced their sovereign, virtual game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we have taken the bones and a concert table with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say, freely in the thought conveyed, at the end.
And especially enjoy the great appeal of visitors.

A fatal accident at the airport of Essen/Mülheim
At Mülheim/Essen Airport it has become a fatal accident.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailplane is stopped on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
In the vicinity of Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche General newspaper" reported, a sailplane was pulled off at the exhibition park at the airport.
The pilot's coming to life.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, if the pilots were on board alone, the pilot should act as an entity.
The aircraft has already been on the landing at the time of the accident.
The detonator is located just outside a fixed area on the airport.
This week, however, there has been an October festival.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two resorts and directly on the road to the highway 52.
From the parking lot, there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Meal or the Gruga Hall in the dining room.
"And then we loved each other."
That the US President of North Korea Machthaber Kim in spite of the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now Trump has made a regular declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "best letters."
At the age of 72, the newly married president of the United States has become known as a new flame.
Tragic: It's a remote connection.
In all the public, Donald Trump made an extraordinary declaration of love on the same day to the North Korean Maxthaber Kim Jong Un.
Prior to arrivals in the U.S. Federal State West Virginia, Trump found nearly half the old Spross of Herrscherdynasty from Pjungjang, although he appeared in the North Koreans as an atomic equipment as a right of such blocks.
"I was quick, he too, and between us it went and here," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not just the conversations with Kim had brought his heart into trouble.
He wrote me beautiful letters, it was great letters.
Your personal connection has also brought political results: Trup refers to the peak of all atomic and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics still see little more than lipenic knowledge.
That the addition to the famous Rocket Man - so Trumps Spitzname for Kim - should not be any memory, seemed to be quite conscious of the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of him in a big sports hall in the city of Wheeling, saying, "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How bad, how bad is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he took care of it very little, explained Trump and directed his witness to the people: "I have always told you it's so simple to be presidial."
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there in this sanded Arena, but we had only 200 people out there.
October party closes many guests to Baesweiler
Baiesweiler is best visited, full of voices, as well as above the sun set: very varied and with a good taste of October festival flair, Baesweilers Innstadt has been released on Sunday.

Refugees Thank you for saving video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have been able to access their disaster-related prison conditions in Libya through a phone video and thus have been able to save them.
The group had driven the entry into its cells in the coastal city of Savija in July under the threat of life and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We lead here, we die here.
The entry was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors warned the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally evacuated to Nigeria by the end of August.
"Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old attempt to reach the Mediterranean to reach Europe was made in Libya.
With the video, he took his own statement at risk of life.
One of his rivals had been shot almost to death by the guards, Oneka said.
In general, the sea conditions have been catastrophic: "They strike us all with rats and dogs."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees scattered in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the program, IOM speakers in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now saved is not uncommon in view of the bad port conditions in Libya.
He hasn't heard from any help from a video on the phone before.
International organizations have been critical of the situation in the Libyan refugee camps for a long time as human beings.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

Laschet has legal status in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has adopted his own statement of legality in Turkey in a speech with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relationship between the two countries was currently "oversighted", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Kolner Airport.
This is particularly true of the prisoners, the press and freedom of religion.
Therefore, he said at Erdogan that if relations are to be normalized in the future, economic relations should be extended, that the rule of law is a very important condition.
Lasche speaks according to his own information also the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of thought would be considered.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The talk of Laschet and Erdogan was recently delivered in a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Kolner Airport.
Initially, it was to be found on the castle wall - but the lockers had rejected the political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued his talk to open the Dibi-Moschee in Cologne.
Laschet had a joint performance in the construction work.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact partner - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not be able to stress the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the ostasi regime is closer to each other.
Foreign Minister Ri asks for an arrival in Washington.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has called for the US government to block negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The youngest resistance is therefore that the United States is building on enforcement measures that are harmful to confidence training," Ri said in New York.
A provision for North Korea under these circumstances is unforgettable.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will attack ourselves as the first one," the North Korean Chief Diplomat said.
North Korea's criminal action could "press on the dogs" is "a desire of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atom test plant, Hob Ri has done so.
However, the US side did not provide "suppressive reactions", the minister criticized it.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and rocket programme, the UN Security Council had decided three times a year alone against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have taken the United Nations in recent days on strict compliance with criminal measures.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's Machthaber Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the president of the United States wants a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again discuss the completion of the North Korean nuclear weapon programme after Pjungjang.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with expenses from the community
Since they were actually in a youth meeting, many visitors from the house of the open door Hot found nothing with: white blankets and flowering on the table and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the Erndedank good service.
The young people of the Hot had made the buffet with costumes from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by expenditure from the community, for which the young people wanted to be grateful for the food.
This was not just the start with the new facility, as Henriette Westbuer, the leader of the Hot, remembered.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared on the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: A stroke had set the heavy, double cold apart, the food was ruined and had to be taken care of.
"Now we had to start again: although we received very much support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to create it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed it.
The result could be seen that the guests were impressed.
"It can't be better to cook," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido-Kurbisup was served or the guests served at a kitchen, dining room or kitchen.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their legs," stressed Pfarer Frank Beckmann, while Zauberer Stephan Lammen with cards and other works of art for restations.
Jürgen Sator leaves the country's president NRW of the table
From fruit on criticism from its own ranks, the Chief of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his posts in the country's relations.
Sartor was well known because the Essener table had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He was already back in July as vice president of the NRW tables, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
There's too many of us in the back.
The head of the Tablen-Country Association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding of the decision of his longtime representative.
The sharp criticisms have taken Sartor with them.
"I can follow his step - there have been people who didn't even know exactly why the dining table is doing it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener table - "six days a week, because nothing changes", so Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized colleagues of other tables in the "World on Sunday" again.
You can't follow the approach without the people in the city.
It is the task of the State to ensure that people do not become pregnant.
At a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essener did not participate.
"I'll be told too much sweet taste," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that have criticized me at the time.

At 2:2, the holes play a lead twice.
Switches to main on the first session (1:0).
(sda) Four times, the first five league games with early giants have been run into exile.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again placed those forces on the day that it had placed the first place behind the Bayerns in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf brought home the minipolster with a compact defence performance after the 11th minute of Yewgeni Konopljanka per head.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund hails again from the tip of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had engaged against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, however, came to 4:2.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) are similar to a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in 63 minutes, provided another double in the final phase (86/94).
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Against the backdrop of a yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic already had to bind the Stuttgarters between the time before the break.
Borna Sosa and the unmarked Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a curiosian property owner, who stopped the guests in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience complete happiness, but neither did he experience a failed debt for Borisia Mönchengladbach.
The gladbachers with the Swiss quarter Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Long gave a hand-held guide, played at 2:2 and waited as before 2003 for an exit visit to VW City.
For Wolfsburg's comparison to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second Bundesligator.
In the 20-metre flats of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was free of charge as well as in the second attack after an hour.
However, the trends at Gladbach are quite surprising.
Alassane Pléa is seen in the stream of the holes as a gold mine.
On the contrary, the French record purchase by the OGC Nice was held for the third time in follow-up and for the seventh time in the seventh game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach sits on the 4th floor.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unencumbered value of Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart was in an unconstitutional position.

Nürnberg chose the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 in the north for himself.
After a half hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team to course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new national names
In Macedonia today, about 1.8 million citizens agree on whether the name of their country should be changed in Northern Macedonia.
In one case, the conflict with the neighbouring Greece could have been resolved for almost three decades.
Athens had been on a name change due to its equal-name northern province and every approach to Macedonia was blocked to the west.
The electors therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could become a NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Sir in U-Haft.
The refugee attacked three women.
A cirrhosis of three pensioners was brutal and it seriously injured her.
The 41-year-old Asylwerber had scheduled to fly 22 hours on Friday in Alserbund.
When the police came in, they spoke to the accused, who had been released by bars on passengers and tried to attack them, on his behaviour.
In addition, the Syrians tried to strike and kill the officials.
Shortly thereafter it appeared that the suspect had shot three older women on the road in front of the Mérringer street at a road station (65, 67, 75) with his feet on the ground.
In addition, he was wearing the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were severely injured.
They experience haematomas, seizures and brain damage.
Asylwerber was "from an unknown reason", as it had been from the police, and was severely injured.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored regularly during treatment.
SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, they gave the Javort.
A registered life partner had not come to her for questioning, Kahrs had said before the "image" quote.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old horse is a political speaker of the SPD Bundestags Group and one of the speakers of the seaheimer circle, of the conservative SPD flight.
In the Bundestag's debate on the opening of the wedding for homosexuals, Kahrs was awarded a statement on 30 June 2017.
So he had urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "overtold" on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in a play on the visible link of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal couples can marry exactly as heterosexuals.
They had been able to introduce their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with the marriage, i.e. with the right to adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters heck cut
There was a lot of work for the members of the Civil Association of Children's House and the Society for Lepracund.
Because around 400 metres of hecke should be cut off around the gardens of the inhabitants of the prairie house.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said the president of the Civil Association, Walter Schröer.
And it's been collected like this.
Because of the hot summer, we are late this time, but luckily, it's just a piece of shape now.
Because in the early years, you've already shot the heck once.
The following morning at work also has a long tradition.
"It's supposed to stay with all the forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Mastership in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Canuslalom-WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship.
The 29-year-old took a perfect course on the Olympics on Sunday.
Two years ago he spent three hundred seconds on the Olympic Bronze.
I was well prepared, had already had enough driving on the plant, and it's been all right today," said the Olympics trip from London 2012.
In the goal he took his paddel away in front of joy and wore both arms safely in the height - of course it would be at least enough for a medal.

The police inspection Gauting reports the first entry test of this brain in a single family home.
Fortunately, the killers broke up.
The days will be shorter - that's what criminals want to use again.
So the police inspection Gauting announced yesterday the first intrusion test of this brain.
The fact that it has remained at the home of the single family on the King's road is to thank the alarm system.
It went out that way just 20 hours before the fireman set up on Friday.
The offenders knew, however, that the inhabitants were not at home.
However, the alarm system surprised them clearly in such a way that they did not catch the flight without being shot.

Place of birth at Hertha: From reality: Bayern vs Ajax
The propaganda is inconceivable: The Netherlands in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to "do not fall".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interfacing phase for the time of the office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performances under the new Coach Niko Kovac should not, however, increase to the greater residue depth for the Munichns.
"A week ago, the impression was still made, we're invisible.
Now we have a little bit of the reality," Thomas Müller noted after the valuable 0:2 nudement at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction to the champion's League Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, who knows that we are rightly concerned and we are giving gas to this direction on Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year ago, no own tower has been shot, as at the same time of the pre-session two games in series without winning the lead of the football club first lost to Borusia Dortmund.
However, the overall situation is not as dramatic as the end phase of the divorced Carlo Ancelotti end September 2017, but the recordmaster must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their players' Christmas chairs over the outside in three days have delivered the same two blues as the last great-looking Bayerns have yet to knock.
"Those who know the FC Bayerns know that we won't let that happen and we'll do everything we can to make it happen again," Kovac stressed.
On the other hand, with his losses in his hometown, however, he was amazingly calm and created his first humble as Münchner Coach only on the long-lasting relationship with chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and the Borussian Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still have a positive effect on the country's first interfacing phase - otherwise the tone would have to be shaken.
Kovac also did not take exceptional measures before the second phase of king-class departure this season after 2:0 at Benfia Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round against Ajax, which was also forced to capture AEK Athens with 3:0.
"Now we're stuck in two games, but we're going to make our doors again," declared National Mission Captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost pocal final against the entry of Frankfurt to the same place, Joshua Kimmich Čext spoke in particular.
The lawyer is acting as a manager.
"I don't think it's all fair, we have to work it again, because we don't make the number of chances and make the mistake," stressed the 23-year-olds shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game, the Bayerns even placed five figures behind Dortmund, who now took over the peaks with a point of precipitation.
And so, Kimmych, with an eyebrowing at least positive, now that the public debate on the relatively indistinguishable Bayerns has come to an end.
"Yes, but that's already good," said the national player.
It's already good for the League.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Caus: Scharfe Attack by Erdogan and Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan, with serious prejudices, extends an exemption from Mesut Ösil and Ilyka Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees error, but defends the link line.
A new mail will be created now.
Berlin - At various stages, Recep Tayip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought about the density in the long-term battle theme Mesut Ösil.
After the Turkish President criticised the deal with the former World Master in Germany for opening the Great Dibi-Mosche in Cologne, the DFB Chief defended the link line.
Early Sunday morning, Ozil personally pointed to the consequences of the consequences of the cause of ZDF-"Sportstudio" in the main.
"We must in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-Mans - very close consequences that this does not happen again," said the 57-year-olds and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration tasks.
At the same time, Grindel once again explained that Erdogan does not belong to the values of the football and the DFB.
With sharp words, this had voiced racism against Özil and Ilya Gündogan.
Our born and raised Mesut Ösil and our Ilkaya.
They have excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the city of Domstadt.
I could not honestly say as your President, that our two young men, who have been admitted to the German National Mission, have been excluded.
Grindel refers to Gündogan's statement that he, in contrast to Ösil after the WM campaign that took place by photos of the two with Erdogan, felt "responsibly treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would want to appear before the players in the future.
That's what someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am an immigrant - that's not going.
"That he has such an impression, I regret very much," said Grindel.
We had to protect Mesut more than I've ever said.
However, he does not see a basis for a return to the national team.
In addition to the Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, which has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed.
"If a non-Migrating background has a significant impact on society and football and says, "The topic is important because we need to take care of ourselves," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our unity in a place where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus and the Özil-Affrey, he wants to re-apply the office as DFB President in the coming year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as it goes," Grindel said.
Last year, three accidents occur within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the incident on Friday between 10 and 13 hours.
First, the 75-year-old driver of a lady was contacted at the red bell in the audience area.
This one told the renter that he would be in danger of her car.
However, there was no personal exchange, since the 75-year-old lady could no longer find the lady on the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a phone call from a car driver who had come from the street and had taken a lead.
In response, the man did not want any police in front of him, and he was immediately in danger of that.
Then the red man went home.
However, the renter has been in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, practiced and cleaned up a construction vehicle while traveling.
Finally, the police could find him and arrest him.
His car showed serious accidents.
The 75-year-old made a bad impression and couldn't think of much more.
The damage is about EUR 1300.
Moorburn in meppen: Still nearly 1000 uses force in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand in a federal territory in Emsland, 980 employees are still employed in the mines.
That's what the Germans shared on Sunday.
As the position of a speaker continued to be stable, 70 anonymous assistants were removed.
A further reduction in the number of use forces has been planned, that is.
On the night of Sunday, an overaird fire was discovered and deleted.
Last week the disaster was lifted, which was well announced a week before September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would endanger the surrounding forests and settlements by wind and funnel flight.
On Thursday, then, there was no more noise from the fire to the surrounding communities.
In the meantime, more than 1500 users tried to get the Great Fire under control.
The aircraft continues to support the work on the federal test site in Meppen with a transport driver.

The register should facilitate organ care and relieve the sufferers of stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue to be adopted only with express consent, stressing Swiss transplantation.

It turns out that 15 percent of Switzerland has a way of spending, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will find a card at the decisive moment in potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the members do not know the will of the deceased.
"Then they have to decide, in the sense of the dead, what is often very burdensome," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in the United Kingdom.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organs on the disease cassette card, as the talker of the Federal Centre for Health Statement, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no record in which people can enter their wishes - pro or against organs -," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn spoke for a reorganisation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as an organist, whether he or his colleagues objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects it.

Farms can start on Monday with the annual ski lift
Schleswig-Holsteins Farms can start on Monday with the annual ski lift.
The unique "green valleys" in Germany have been the landscape of the wilderland of Germany for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide range of trees and shrubs are the "worldset" and for many animals and plants the last back spaces.
Knicks connects as Corridor-wide living spaces that can still function on the exchange of organisms, as the business leader of the Nature Protection Board of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living cells
The Knicks were established on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christ VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living zones" were not only field restrictions and Viehzaun, they also supplied the farmers with fuel and balks for their business houses.
Since that time, his name "Knick" has also come to be known: through "Maknicken" of the Eggs, the dense, fragrant boundaries could develop.
Today, between the north and the east, about 45,000 miles [45,000 km] of Hecken and gives the picture of a fertile, multidimensional structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are currently used as a replacement area of about 7,000 animals.
In a kilometer, Knick could live up to 1800 different species and live up to 30 birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be met if it is performed properly in winter.
In other words, he enjoys a light range of trees, which, besides the variety of species, also involves wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
The ship's crew may only be operated by the Ministry of Agriculture from October to March, as indicated by the Ministry of Agriculture.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia talks about location ahead of location
The native Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on your own during the tsunami?
No, I was right at the time in Jakarta on Java Island.
When the Earth was alive, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned from Tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be imposed.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also brought other people.
Where are the people who live on Sulawesi now?
Many are born on surrounding hills, where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their homes, there's still nowhere to go.
Because many food shops and also the tanks are completely closed, people partially steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely detached and the national government is helping.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners were partially free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies here, many people have not been found and are lost.
How does communication and information supply run on the island?
At the moment, we have handyyception, however, it has not worked before, and we have only got information on radio.
Many people still look for their children, neighbors and others who do not know whether they are alive and where they are staying because people were not at home during the day, but for example, at work.
The Tsunami alarm system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for it, but when the alarm came, many thought "OK, no Tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by Tsunami, there was a lack of information that a Tsunami was hit on the region and they were hit by the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Firering, prepared on Earth?
But there's rain every day, but that was the worst thing here.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has been broken down, and the earthquake has hit many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI survey in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned acquisitions is very limited.
With a FBI survey in Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to ensure a high-level majority of the candidates for the panel of judges who have argued for the purposes of exploitation.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline until Friday to clarify the necessary events that have occurred over 30 years ago.
The most recent wind in the drama about the occupation of Kavanaughs, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was released on Friday.
After eight hours of hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, in whose case the judge was excommunicated against the opposition Democrats, the Court's Justice Committee should make the way open for the final confirmation of the conservative director at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of the Republicans appeared to be certain that suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
After multuristic scenes, his party friends wanted to join him.
President Trump, who had called the harsh conditions on Thursday as a "best" first included further attacks on women and spoke against "happy in the accident".
In this way the last doubts could be solved, he said.
In a election campaign, Trump later attacked the Democrats because they refused to stop Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy them."
Trump ordered FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of the Founder.
A government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go to an ambulance."

There is also the Federal School Centre.
The city community also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Man has overcome the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season against Mainz.
The relief on scale is great after the first season.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Middleway is widely known that Christian Heidel is a giant pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many acres and many pools in our strand," said Schalke's sports board, 04 - and pointed out.
Finally, the king's blues were still able to bring about 1:0 against the rheins over time and thus bring the first season under the roof and fashion.
This would have really been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of Chief of the Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "In summation, the first half was good, both playable and the pressing here."
In fact, create no headaches
"The last ten minutes have been like two hours for me," said Heidel, "if the man was only half as nervous as I am on the bank, I can understand."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and so they kept coming back.
And with man and mouse he defends himself against man.
To save the first three figures of the season.
"All of us have fallen a lot of stone from the heart," said the creature who had no significant share in it with his headball player: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the human race."
But in the end, it's only the victory.
The relief was impressive throughout Arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the initial phase and make a firework," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for humanity and fans.
We've played intelligent, peaceful and courageous, so we've got to play parties over 90 minutes.
The biggest manko of the afternoon: the king's blue replaced it, rather for clearer relations of concern.
Finally, the possibilities for this were that of the strong Yevhen Compplyannaka, who twice met the latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then there wouldn't have been a quote," said Tedesco, "I've been afraid of a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we've won.
So he wasn't the only switch.
Fishbachaau: Smoking salt in bed 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be seen.
From about two kilometers away, a walker in the lead room observed a fire on Sunday at 13.30 a.m..
Now it's the police.
Fishbachau - The reason for the discovery of police and firemen soon appeared: An unknown person had visited a large area on a two-quameter scale at the Gschwendner Berg Müll.

And that's near the forest.
30 Fiscal firefighters were engaged in the construction and disposal.
The police are on fire now.
Prof. Dr. Alain El-Mafaalani discussed integration: A discussion on eye heights
The author is Professor Alain El-Mafaalani.
He has been following the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Housechild for the next time.
"I've been doing this for many years, taking interested people to Greven," explained the founder and president of the "reckenfelder Meeting" - the one who co-operated in the evening's orientation with the "cultural policy" campaign.
El-Mafaalani is very keen in reading, describes the writing process of the book, explains how difficult it was to explain the subject clearly.
With a lot of gestics, fixed numbers and one or more whites, he brings audiences closer to one of the most controversial topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author is responsible for answering the question of a metaphor.
On a table, the German society is located, on the catenic side, the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they are already on the big table and want to be with them now.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not a matter of whether you are politically right or left-wing, but, "I am for or against an open society?" he stressed.
At first, we behave more and more, and then the discussions are always under way.
And there's a need to talk.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unencumbered integration in students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not on the stage, a meaningful image for the discussion: it is at the height of the eye.
The sociology professor does not stress his opinion, stresses that he is speaking from the average, not from individual cycles.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the next Signer hour, he has also been given an open ear to the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively further discussion.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 pieces
The need is obvious: over 100 interested parties have sought to buy one of the basics in the south of Landsham.
The Community has sold the first pieces of groundsham-South in the free market.
This is shared by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 basic items which offer the community more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous domestic model.
Good 100 applications have been made, so frick.
"At this time the documents will be checked", with regard to the criteria for application, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Pilinger Mayor, it is the aim of establishing the competition list for the 20 basic items by the end of the year and to present them to the Council.
Then the donation could be made.
In total, 50 basic units for single and double houses are created in the south of Landsham as well as four areas for multiple homes with an estimated eight units of residence.
The solution is as good as done, the roads and roads should be packed first.
A single piece and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the Community's planning.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 basic pieces in the social-contractual model.
The two multi-family homes of the Community are to be built according to Frick as a affordable living room.
With a total of 16 apartments promoted by the Freistaat.
Place for 200 people
Grob is estimated to be created in the area of the new area of Landsham-South living room for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, early October, according to Frick, there is the start for the renewal of a child's seat.
There are three childcare groups and three groups of goats, as well as a multi-purpose area.
The opening will be scheduled for September 2019, to start the next child-garden year.
So far, naldo "great sport" is also on the bank
At the third time, it is not in the start: However, Naldo is grateful to the Schalke trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Starttelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two-foot Brazilians had ever told the fruit of the soul so correctly.
But when the chess player gathered after 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, as usual in the middle circle, and thanked the chief of Domenico Tedesco for all his professions, the 36-year-old, who called himself Naldo, joined and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," said Tedesco later about the reaction of his visa-capitals, who, despite his renewed reserveist design, did not raise any groll.
Certainly Naldo, who has been celebrated as the best speaker in the past season, knows that he has actually not actually been on his trainer's stand - but for good reason, he gets a break.
A reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him what I'm telling you honestly," said Tedesco from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the start.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always going back to the thing, it's about the union," Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that you can get through all the time.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which has also highlighted Naldo.
And the Brazilians reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself on the bank as an exemplary Tempalayer.
In August, the vote in Austria's industry has accelerated its ceiling compared to the Eurozone.
The sales manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month basis.
In Europe, however, Austria has the third largest vote in Ireland and the Netherlands, and the market institution shared its inquiry on Monday with some 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the Euro-zone PMI increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still under the mark of 50 figures, which accounts for growth.
Only Ireland's industry was hit by 50.9 points in August.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, however, the vote barometer was lower than in the previous months.
In Spain the index reached the highest point since March.
"The slightly cloudy ceiling could mean that the worst is over," said market economy Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains the same in the third quarter anyway - growth brake number.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export contracts in the euro area fall as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore build up in the seventh month following.
In China, industry production was even more accepted in August than at first.
The vote barometer is equal to 49.3 points in the premonmonition to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The sales manager's index supports its figures on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
In particular, developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices will be taken.
