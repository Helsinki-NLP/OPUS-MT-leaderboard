Named after the number of new subscribers in Donbass, Ukraine
The official representative of the National Police of the Lugan People's Republic of itself (LNR) said that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass in the summer of 2018-2019.
In his statement, Kiev is thus planning “somewhere to complete the units”.
"The desire of Ukrainian citizens to serve in a number of Ukraine's VSs has led to a low integration of units," said Marčco, quoted as the RIA News.
It also did not exclude that the actual numbers referred to in the Ukrainian army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO) that later changed to the Joint Force (OEC).
This measure was expected to strengthen the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
By the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasse had deteriorated due to the murder of the head of DNA Alexander Saharcenko.
The DNA authorities have qualified the past as a trajectory.
During the criminal investigation, a number of persons who were involved in the bombing were arrested.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the division had been organized by Ukrainian special services.

The head of the British MDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Britain Jeremy Hunt compared the Euros Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of planting the member countries of the Community.
The diplomat made this statement at the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, opened on 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulty in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: If you turn the EU out of the prison community, the desire to leave it will not be reduced, but will only grow, and we will not be the only expert who wants to flee the country," the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave Eurojust would only undermine the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, Prime Minister Teresa Mae said the Brexit negotiations were in vain.
It thus commented on the results of the informal summit of the Eurojust in Salzburg.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will cooperate after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question remains open on the Irish border.

Ilon Mask is forced to leave the head of the Council of Directors of Tesla
The U.S. precious books and bags and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask settled their dispute on fraud.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the Telecanal, the agreement reached in Moscow must leave the head of the Board of Directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the Commission has allowed Moscow to maintain its position as head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla is also obliged to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will rise with Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the injured investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American entrepreneur who is on the list of 50 richest people on the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX SpaceX, the neurotechnology company Neurlink and the manufacturer of Tesla electrons as well as Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously brought before the Director-General of Tesla Ilon Maska, for his communication published on Twitter about the possibility of buying a company.
Last month, Moscow announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares at a fixed price at $420.
The value of the share in $420 was set out as "because of the importance of this number in the Marhiwan culture", the agency Bloomberg reported earlier with reference to the director of the Security Department of the Commission of St. Beijing.
In the meantime, Ilon Mask subsequently refused to buy shares from his plans.
Commenting on the commission on the valuable books and cases of the United States, the businessman stated that he considered charges of fraud unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and impressed with these claims.
"Truth is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn't break it in any way," said a businessman in the CNC interview.
In August, a group of shareholders of Tesla filed a collective complaint against Masca calling for financial losses.
The respondents claimed that the businessman's mails brought them their losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessmen had made a mistake, so the salesmen of Tesla had to buy books on artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other speakers also noted that the unsolicited statements of Ilona Masca resulted in serious cross-sections of the course.
In September, Ilona Maska also accused the head of the research company Citron Research in pig mills.
In the meantime, if Moscow could not resolve its dispute with the U.S. commission on securities and exchanges, it would threaten to withdraw from the company's leadership and even prison.

The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought to Fleming the universal praise and made it the Nobel laureate.

Tramp told about "love" in Kim Chen Yun
From the violence of the United States leaders and the CDR, whether it was easy to fall in love with each other, Donald Tramp sought out.
President Donald Tramp noted his success in resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now expressed so much concern that the American President noted that they were hardly in love with each other.
The White House recalled that it had adopted the previous North Korean administration's problem as a major problem in foreign policy.
Tramp noted that Barak Obama's team had so much to do with the CDR that it could not even be called to the country's leadership - there was just not a tape recorder.
At that time, the United States and the CDR were at war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House “precious letters”, said Trip.
Tramp acknowledged that at the beginning of his work, he was also a "best" to Kim Chen Yun, which, in turn, was mutual.
Now, however, their relationship was so close that the leaders “loved one another. ”
In doing so, the Tempp requested that his words not be understood literally and warned that American media interpreted them as incompatibility.
The tramp drew attention to the fact that Phinyan had recently stopped nuclear and rocket tests, as well as to the military police.
All of this is the service of his administration, assured by the President of the United States.
Last Tuesday, Donald Tramp spoke freely about Kim Chen Yin of the UN Genus Assembly.
The tramp thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and for the steps taken to decelerate tension.
In this regard, the Tempp noted that sanctions against the CNDR would remain until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

However, other practical steps are still being taken to denuclearize North Korea.
The media reported that after the Singapore Summit, the United States of America had already sent a number of disarmament scenarios to the CD, but Phinyan rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nichu called for the "Moscow language to the Ukrainian product"
Ukraine's child writer and child struggler for the purity of the native language, Laris Nicho, called on Ukraine to withdraw from it "the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language".
To do this, she proposed that the Ukrainian product be "cultural wool and culturally pressed".
In his views on the "Celebrity of the Eradication of the Russian Language in Ukraine" Nichoe shared with the Ukrainian edition of the "Obozevator".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now ready - it is even now available and continues to grow.
In time, the Ukrainians are "extended" from this "mosko language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that the Russian word had been widely used on television and radio, but it was not in the public area.
In the view of Nice, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the Russian-speaking authorities, in her opinion, are only “the expansion of the border for Ukrainian words at the legislative level”.
Nicho had previously experienced the maintenance of the Ukrainian language regime in the child camp in Karpata, where she had been invited to work.
In December 2016 she threatened the court with a network of Watson's bookstores, one of which she met in Russia.
When he didn't get it, Nicho was in a girl's bag.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", calling for foreigners to reject Russian letters even in family writing.

How did he feel today?"
"If it took 90 minutes, that means it's all right!
In fact, he felt good.
Maybe, at the end of a few bars of power, there's nothing going on.
And yes, Doctor and physicist Vladimir Anatolievic Gashnev brought me to this game for their great thanks!
"What do you say about the atmosphere in the command?"
"It's no one's secret that after victory and recovery, it's easier to get back and set up in a good collection.
Now we have a white field, even though it was early in the morning.
We must continue in the same spirit and be happy with the sick."
"Have you tried for the time that he didn't go out in the field?"
"That's it, it's a little bit of a test, because the really unpleasant situation has gone out.
But again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors who put their feet on it.
Most importantly, we won and advised patients.
And the rest is the second."

It is estimated that the GES is located in the territory of Kosovo, but is concerned with the Serbian energy system.
It is recalled that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but this fact was rejected in Belgrade.
Last year, the parties concluded negotiations on this issue.

Kosovo: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the theme of Russia was virtually missing
The Head of the Board of the Federation of International Affairs of Constantine Kosovo considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not exclude it from becoming an integral participant in addressing global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the present 73st session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have been accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more heard”, said the senator in an interview published in the resurrection of the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the FIF had been “affirmed as one of the three main threats to humanity, namely, the Ebola, as well as climate change or terrorism, in this case, in the case of a group of Western countries which had been sufficiently united on this account.”
At the 73rd session, Kosovo stressed that "the Russian theme in the negative key was practically missing".
"If the statement of the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the people were not perfectly correct," he pointed out, pointing out that Russia was "no longer a wall that trains a tennis match."
The head of the Board of Proficiency of the Sufeda does not rule out that this is evidence of a trend which, in his view, “will be allocated to the current session [United Nations General Assembly], although this trend may well occur through the year, through two or three”.
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some sense be reversible," Kosachev explained, "too many examples of how Russia is able to move forward in international affairs".
As an example, he took the situation in Syria, the region of Iran and North Korea.
"I am sorry, not Ukraine, but I am not sure that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be interrupted in time," the parliament added.
This is related to his belief that "the adequate, healthy expression of Russia as an inalienable participant in addressing global contemporary problems."
"I don't want to lie, but I have a feeling that we're going through a point where the movement won't be moving anymore, it's going to move forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important sense" in this context was the "request for a Russian vision of how to develop modern peace".
"I have attended very many meetings of the heads of the Russian delegation [at the Geneva Assembly] Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrovov, I have held my own meetings, and I have been very pleased to see that if another two or five years ago the Russian opinion, with the Russian view of the world, is of great interest, the situation is different now," said the President of the Sufed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “in the so-called new liberal regime that deals with the West, there is no answer to the world's problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problem of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration”.
"And the request for a Russian vision here becomes more and more evident," he expressed confidence in Kosovo, stressing that this meant "the current successful session for the work of the Russian delegation which was successful for Russia".

Many artists are now talking about how they have managed to cope with oncology.
Sad to say, no one will suffer, but the history of popular peoples of victory over cancer offers hope for many.
A well-known actor, Wahtang Kykabide, admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
A long time ago, he was put in a terrible diagnosis, which he called a sentence.
"I'm like a little down on my head hit.

The authorities called the amount of the gold parachutate of the U.S. governor.
At the same time, 23 payments were made by the Deputy Governor of the Voronej area, Yuri Agibalov, on the basis of regional law on State posts.
However, the actual amount of the “gold parachutate” released from the office of the officer was several times less than the amount derived from the media.
Such explanations were provided by the Regional Government Press Service.
According to the Act, Agibalov's salary is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, in the press service, the amount of one-time payment amounted to 223,892 rubles, not 1 million rubles written by SMEs.
An old-age insurance pension has been received by the journalist since July 2018.
Its status in the State office is more than nine years old.
The appointment of this pension and the simultaneous payment was made immediately after the resignation of the post, explained to the RIA News Agency in the Government of the area.
Agibal's payments to pensions were suspended at the time of appointment, and the amount of his payments had not changed compared to the previous period.

In the context of the general sex education of children, this must be done by causing a loss, as there is a risk to the health of both boys and girls.
The problem is objectively, it is that child rearing is early enough, and there is still a large gap between sexual harassment and the possibility of formal contact between them.
According to Onistenko, the solution to the problem is "pangularity", the reduction of "sex problems" and the lack of a culture of adequate education for children.
The doctor is convinced that there are many adolescents with anonymity.

The GG became the second on population in Germany
The Anti-Migrant Alternative for Germany is a regular record of popularity, and Angel Merkel's ratings fall.
Of course, the people of Germany began to stand out from the immigration policy of Angel Merkel, through which the country has become the target of millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most importantly, this is the latest socio-questioning questions that the Anti-Migrant Party "Alternative for Germany" has become increasingly popular and the positions of the right block of Merkel and Zeehofer have weakened.
This week, ADG killed a regular record, raising a second string in the ratings of folk sympathies.
The right conservators with 17 per cent of the population were able to cover social democracys, with 16 per cent.
Breakdown in one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it cannot be noted that ADG from a small group of Eurosceptic economists in 2013 has been able to turn into a serious political force.
In general, leadership continues to hold the right block of HSC/HDS, with about 30 per cent.
However, there was a trend towards the loss of sharks - still in April support of Angel Merkel's block was at four percentage points above.
The staff rating of the German Chancellor, which is headed by the Government of Germany for the fourth term, is also reduced.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are supported by Angel Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
We add that the "greens" (15 per cent), the left (11 per cent) and the Liberian (10 per cent) are due to social democracy.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Election 2013" group, which came from the Christian-Democratic Union.
The Group was clearly opposed to the government course, but the first ones were only economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
In this context, the Group opposed the "spouse" of Germany to the weak economies of the EU, did not exclude the possibility of return to the German market and the full exit of the country from the EU.
In the context of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group was formed into a fully-evaluated party that took over the Eurosceptics and began to critically criticize the Government for the lack of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADG was the first to be held in Bundestag, receiving 94 MPs (709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" received seats in the European Parliament.
A video published by a journalist called Ukrainian citizen "The Nation of Pains"

As Drozd noted, living and working in that country is difficult.
"We are not attracted to the culture of reading and acceptance of texts from our children," said a journalist.
Local nationalists quickly quoted Droza's criticism, accusing him of being without patriotism and greed.
As noted earlier, the State Committee on Television and Radiology has begun to fight against literature, which has little intention to criticize the key authorities, prohibiting imports of up to 201 copies.

Named Death of the Universe
The universe is still some 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
A study of the international collection of scientists is published in the library of electronic prints, arXiv.org, and published in the journal Publications of the Astronomic Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings have been made by experts watching the telescope Subaru with the help of the HSC (Hyper Supresse-Cam) camera for about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, with more than 95 per cent of the world's energy mass, which was studied by the standard space model LCDM (L Cold Dark Matter), the global expansion rate, which was slightly slower than was previously considered, was assessed.
The survey of Subaru's press release noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of materials in the universe and, in the light of the data from the European Space Telescope Planck, clarified the limitations imposed on LCDM parameters.
In July scientists modeled the possible murder of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had introduced new evidence that the watched world would cease its existence over 22 billion years as a result of the Great Depression.
There was an ongoing attempt to unite the initiatives of the pension referendum
The people ' s view of pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow, a general federal initiative group was convened on Saturday against the ageing of retirement.
It was attended by 13 sub-groups registered with various forms of question (all of the Central Bank registered five statements).
They decided to appeal to the CIC with a request for registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians: "You are not to increase the right to pension by 1 July 2018 by the age of which the citizens of Russia are entitled to ageing?"
This formulation was registered by a voluntary sub-group whose representatives did not participate in the assembly but, in fact, considered it to be a simple and legal structure.
Most of the Assembly participants were members of the "Justice Russia" member Eli Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
It was joined by three independent sub-groups from the Netherlands of Novgorod, Voronez and Orenburg.
Sviridov had previously said that the invitations were sent to all initiatives and that about 40 subgroups had agreed to accept.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of the volunteer subgroup (the wording was supported by 15 others), said "Wedmosts", that she did not receive the invitations and did not plan to visit: "We didn't understand who else but who was the enemy."

"Loko" - "Ahamat" Turbina's errors are burning like the rose of the apple.
Former U.S. judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Arbitrary Evgeni Turbin on the 9th anniversary of the Russian champion Locomotive - Ahmat and discussed the discrepancies of the game.
- How do you evaluate the judgement of Evgenia Turbin in the "Locmotiv" case - Ahmat?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his failure to render justice to the Russian Prime Minister.
I'm surprised that efforts at the fifth round of Spartacus - Dinamo - neither the Turbins nor the DSI leaders made serious conclusions on his low qualifications.
The result has not been slowed down in the ninth tour: errors in its actions, private failure of the grave receipts have been caused by a variety of frauds.
For example, at 50 minutes, the trainer Edera falls into the hands of the "Ahmata" Rodolfo in his stairwell.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put pens.
- How do you appreciate the episode with Ido's participation, which was 82 minutes when it was shown that the sword fell into his hand?
- I think there was an intention to play a defense hand in his painting area.
Turbin has been around for a while, seeing this episode and his first assistant to the case.
The moment must also have been seen by Judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep, and the panels were not assigned.
Thus, the account in the bag was lost, and sports justice was lost.
This was the very case when the concept court was exaggerating and protecting the sports spirit.
At 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanova's guest protector, who violated the rules against the Crimean, and when the judge showed him a welcome card, he was duly executed.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second "guarantee"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first wish card showed no case at all.
The second would be unreasonable.
- Oleg Ivanov said after a discussion of the double standards of justice, that some orders are being held for crimes such as in the episode with Iduma, and something is not.
What do you appreciate about the football player's words?
- I think it's a double standard.
It's a panel.
He didn't give it.
So, the Arbitr does not give a second pen in the opposite direction.
This is the principle used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge sees who's playing.
There he played Locomotive on Saturday and Ahmata has serious claims for the work of the Turbina because the team was injured.
Matt Damon murdered the judge accused of rape Kavano at the age of SNL
American actor Matt Damon won a petition at the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States of America, which is accused of rape.
The demon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live on the NBC.
In the course of a small strike, the actor shot Kavano at the hearings in the prosecution Senate.
The candidate in the Supreme Court of the United States had previously drawn attention to his emotionality and details of his statements during the session with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Yes, Cavano repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but he said that he never drank to the point of memory.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed that he was a girl in those years.
It was also the moment that Damon was playing.
I just made a lot of drinking and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, the most drunk girl I've ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said Judge Matt Damon.
Previously, Cavano had been elected U.S. Supreme Court.
Barbara Straysand found her cloned foreign conduct.
American poet Barbara Straysand said that her dead dog’s clones are completely different from the original pivot.
"They don't look like it.
In fact, [the clones] look like she is, but it's impossible to clone the soul," stressed 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straysand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old coton-de-tulaire species, named Samantha, to be cured of health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the species of chihuahua, called the Miracle Milly, was cloned at 49 times.
Specialists are involved in the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so minimal.
United States has been thinking about Russia ' s maritime blockade due to oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can be launched to gain the advantage of the global energy market.
The American authorities have so much to do with the success of the global carbon market that they are ready to escape to the Russian maritime block, which remains one of the world's leading suppliers of energy.
The U.S. MWD head Ryan Zinke told of the possibility of the maritime block.
Despite world practice, the US Ministry of Internal Affairs does not perform police, but civil functions, including natural resources policies.
Therefore, Zinca's statement was fully in the competence of its governing agency, even though there was not only a political era.
Speaking at the industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the United States military forces control the maritime routes in the neighbouring region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be related to the desire of Washington to mix Russian supplies into the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a cheap share of its income from the global supply of oil and gas markets.
The desire to allocate energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main reason for the activation of Moscow in this region, believed in Zinca.
The Minister understood that the United States continued to consider providing leadership to the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
For this reason, Washington has to worry about Russia and Iran, and the maritime block of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this route, says Zinka.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former Captain Chelsea and the Assembly of England John Terry - about why he visited the 9th floor of the Russian "Spartacus" "Restov" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I've been following him very recently, and I've been interested in looking at him.
I can't say I'm a patient, as my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have Spartacus's sympathy and I want to apologize for the decision," says Terry Chelsea Hospital.
Remember, Rostov, with 18 shots, was raised on the third floor of the tournament, and Spartacus was placed on the fifth track, with 15 shots active.
In the next tour, on October 7th, they're playing with Enisem, and the late Valeria Carpin will be hosted by Orenburg earlier.
The road's gone down to the standoff.
When the LBC Boutique and Loan Lambard, located in the city of Somerville (Massachussets), a man offered a script for the looks of the old and unpresentable instrument of a Lambardian worker at $50.
But the experienced manager of the store, Dylan Mcdermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool and sought advice from the expert.
It was found that the script was produced in 1759 by the Italian script master Ferdinando Galjano and is estimated at $250,000.
One of the reasons for the script is estimated at $16-18 thousand.
The investigation revealed that the script had not been stolen so long in one of the city's residents, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
As long as it was unknown how the inscription fell to a man, I put it in a lobby, but there's no prior contact with the law.
The manager says that now all those in the lobby will ask for a script to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the client.

In white-white now, it's not easy: a club once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe's team Masimo Carrera suddenly flew into the Rapidu, and recently entered the home of Ahmatu.
After the crackdown with the CSCA, which ended fair nothing, Spartacus had a minimum account and not without work in Quebec, Montenegro, and had been talking about whether Russia's most popular club was nearing the end of the crisis.
"Rates" could not win three matches, so the injuries don't know five more.
Let us see if Carpin is able to extend the unencumbered series to himself as a mother.

It started at 19:00.

Adults are punished by Agutina's election on the Golos show.
The viewers of the show Golos 60+ accused Leonida Agutina's teacher of "unbelieving confusion and tension".
When he first heard the voice of his father, Nicolas Agutina, in his silent audience, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the executioner.
But his sons' feelings took up, and he chose a relative in his command.
Then many thought this was a joke, but they forgave the teacher for the first time indiscriminately.

"You like the poet, organize a concert in Kremlin for your money, and see how many people come to this concert."
It's a Golos show, not a Red family show.
"It was unprofessional on the part of Agutina."
"Then you have to offer your own show, not the show that works for 1 Canal."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took some place.
And I don't understand why the pope has to make me understand more than any other participant with actual oral data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a great voice and a fever come down, and Father Agutina brought him to the finish?
And then we all regret that on the stage and on the screen the same person for decades!
That's why you don't break the chain!"
"What did you expect?
That's Russia!
I'm surrounded by bluffs and amphibians.
Yes, and money in the family budget will not be alone!
The theater's gone crazy!"
The users also recalled that in one of the traditional "Golos" seasons, the son of Gradsko was brought up in blind hearings.
Then the meter and the head didn't have to take the son into their own command.
More than that, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all right."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

The incident occurred on September 29th on the street of Ivan Kudri, reported to the police.
According to the victim, an unknown person approached him and spoke to him, but he immediately took his knife and needed to give him money and a cell phone.
Since the victim was not available, the stranger ordered money from the bank card.
After the attacker got 4,000 gloves and phone calls, he hit the victim and fell down," the report said.
The guards were able to arrest the recruiter and had 25-year-olds.
Now he's threatened to be free for seven years.
The police also have a version of the criminal's involvement in other such crimes.
Remember, the attack in Odèsse has resulted in a number of reasonable attacks on the inquisitors.
In one of the cases of armed recruits, they were caught using the drone.
The scientist discussed the possible scientific programme of the FIF to the Moon
The head of the RAN Institute of Space Studies, a member of the RAN Correspondent, Anatoly Petrukovic, told RIA News about a possible research programme for Russian spacecraft in Luna.
According to him, the scientific community is now developing such a direction.
"Consolidated opinion is not yet," stressed the scholar.
He noted that one of the options was the location of a low-frequency radiotelescope on the other side of the moon, which would avoid the interference of the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space radiation sources," said Petrukovic.
He also believed that the moon could be used to test the technicians, use local construction resources.
In addition, it is believed that the cosmonauts should be involved in the search for the Earth's satellite of a primitive body.
This could help to determine how life appears on the planet.
The former head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that the RFF would be able to carry out a piloted flight to Luna by 2030.
The client has removed the case with the evidence in the 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called "mail tooth" to the head of the 7-Eleven network network network, was released in May for unpleasant behavior from the store.
And he decided to give up his enemy in an original way.
In the second half of the night, he entered the store and pulled out a piece and part of the goods placed on the floor of the kitchen.
There were faeces and powers in the kitchen that Simms had "friended" from the nearby mobile biotovule.
The police had arrived at the scene and arrested the artist.
He was put in prison and released to court at $300.
He was charged with illegal entry into foreign property and criminal offences and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
While Simsa's crime appears to be more funny than serious, the trial can be severe enough, as he has repeatedly violated the law: it includes theft in large size, theft, illegal arms control, car management and cruel treatment of animals.

The Minister believes that there are two options for the development of events: military and economic.
First, it would prefer not to use, so it is necessary to push and drain Iranian energy.

Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful
The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Sirotkin, commented on the outcome of the Gran-pre-Russian race.
"Well, I'm honest, I don't really want to say what's in my head.
I had a good start, and on the second floor, I was in between two cars, who were immediately offended.
I lost all the positions I played at the old time, right now.
He was in a very bad position.
He shot in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest of the pith, we would fall into the "clean air" and return to the pace, but the roots were gone.
Plus had a fight with the opponent, and he had a relationship with him.
As I understand, he's a little wrong.
We were in this situation at the most improbable break of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and that was very painful if it was true.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA News.
We remember that Sirotkin in the race at Gran-prisian Russia won the 18th, and he became the winner of the British "Mersedes" pilot Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpišev called the absurd removal of Glushakova and Estanko from the "Spartacus"
President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpišev commented on the removal of the footballists of the Moscow "Spartacus" Dennis Gluškova and Andreya Estanko from training with the main post-lying post-lying team coach Masimo Karreri, reports "Sport weekend".
Karrera's actions were totally absurd.
To pay attention to such things is an indistinct folly.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It's just a misunderstanding in the team.
First of all, it's letters, reading and accepting them as appropriate.
I wouldn't have responded to this at Carrery's place.
Each one has his own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be healed.
If the Glušakov and Estanko are wearing clothes, that doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian doesn't understand the flexibility of the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal climate in the team.
Today, Spartacus has no game, so this situation has not been resolved at all.
Maybe you should laugh about it together.
"Spartacus" has very little in the way of different lines, there is uncertainty after the introduction of youth.
The internal relations of the teams, the judge of all, do not add optimism to the matter," Tarpišev was convinced.
The game of two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 19 a.m. by Moscow time.
Previously on Spartacus, John Terry led the young Chelsea team.
Masters of Sirius discussed science-like technologies
Teachers of the educational centre of Sirius in Sochi, the Agrobiology and Genetics School of Plants visited the lecture of the National Research Centre of the Kurchatov Institute.
The presentation of researchers was under the programme of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Natural-like Technologies, organized by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, on 29 September at the educational centre.
The lecture opened a documentary film "Code Kurchatova", during which the President of the Kurchat Institute, RAN Correspondent Michael Kovalschuk told of global challenges as a driving force for civilisation development.
A scholar's lesson is published on Sirius' website.
The students learned that modern technology was needed in a large amount of energy.
Alternative energy is still not possible.
This problem, said the forum organizers, will be addressed by natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalschuk raised the issue of responsibility for developing such technologies, as well as discussing the risks that inevitably arise when such technologies are created.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a very good thing.
It's an explosive growth of medical technologies, it's an improvement in quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of such technologies is in fact a technological reconstruction of living systems.
There is a turnaround, a targeted intervention in human survival.
There's always a risk.
There's a car coming up -- people fell in the car.
But cars are still in use.
The dual nature of technology is fast.
I create a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," says a scientist REN TV.
After the film review and the discussion of contemporary school breaks, the students were able to ask the meeting participants.
In the role of speakers, the candidate for physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurtat NBICs-Secret of Nature-like Technologies NIC, the Kurchatov Institute, and the head of the Kurts NBICs-Technology Group, Wicheslav Demin.

Macedonia: The referendum was not due to low incidence
The referendum was called upon to approve the Agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje on the appointment of the Balkan country to North Macedonia.
Greece opposed the use of Macedonians of the name of their historic province.
The change led to the opening of the route to NATO and later to the EU of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

On 30 September, a report from the social network was received from the observer that the animals on one of the local libraries were freely distributed.
The animals passed a small step between the fence and the grass.
The commentators expressed various views: one of the local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of a small red cat in the area, and their appetite could even help to clean the territory of snakes and grasslands, but some of the inhabitants of the town did not have a life-threatening attitude:
"It's brains, not panties.
I don't want to do anything there.
Of course you don't say they're angry, but that's not the case."
In other words, one of the observers noted that the problem of the animal species was already known among the leaves and that the necessary measures would soon be taken.
Let's go and get it - how right?
The word to push doesn't exist.
That's right.
The word "press" means "press, exerting, exerting, influencing" is only a phonetic, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "approach".
We use this word, believing it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "reach" are not only emotionally close, but even in some way contradictory.
Make sure of that.
To satisfy (a church of books, older) means "sufficient, full, sufficient, sufficient to be enough for anyone or anything to satisfy."
Enjoy, pleasure is a family word.
Earlier, it had the meaning of "no matter what, having self-satisfaction" - "self-satisfying".
The old-fashioned "fashioned" family words "great" and "good".
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
These words are now offensive to "families": daos-walk, deyja, "dead" and twice "trembling".
A similar phonetic form of the word “pressure” and “endure” as well as the inconsistencies of the last has led to the introduction of them into contamination.
We have thus shown the same "d" that is also used in letters through "a", which, rather, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the occurrence and development of those words.
Well, that's right.
But this is an older word, which in its proper sense is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you above, use the word "give".
You can also use the "pressure" construction, but remember that it's the office.

It'll not be easy in any case, because our car's a remarkablely slowing machine, Mercedes.

The head of the Union Division of External Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolit Ilaron, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow's patriot in the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of Jewish fascists.
"It's all the same as that in the Fascist Germany in the euro for the burning of a hot summer star, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill has been created," said the Mittropolith in the Russian-24-Telecane.
In his view, this step will have the most serious consequences, especially now when the Russian-Ukraine conflict is at a severe stage.
Kiev is thus expected to have full control of the CAP and to “put it out of the law”, the minister thinks.
"It's the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves thieves, they're patriots of their country," he added.

The text of his address to the faithful Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) is published on the public website on Saturday.
At various times, our ancestors and relatives of faith and the spirit of Christians had to express their faith and defend their holiness.
In view of the situation that has taken place and the information that we have and the threats to the discourses that are being circulated, it is evident that we need something to survive," said the Mitropolith.
He asked for the support of prayer, moral.
The deputy of the lab also stressed that "your physical presence will probably be required."
The priest added: "The sons of Lenin, by the Spirit, are in a state of confusion, and then they protect their own holiness."
Anyone who is not an impartial judge of the Court of First Instance is a righteous Ukrainian and universal saint, who must be prepared to protect her, is speaking in the course of treatment.
Mitropolith called not to go against those who lead a believer astray.
The UPC has a canonic status determined by Tomos from 29 October 1990 by Mother Church.
And now someone wants to be dependent on the novelist patriarch and another Catholic pope of Rome, Varfolome.
A new style with its consequences is a legal objection.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," noted the deputy of the lab.
He recalled that since October 1990, OHCHR has been able to be independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow patriot.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What else do we need to do?" - said the poet of the Pochaevsk Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether there are other gatherings of Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
And those who believe are gathered together, and determine in what house they are going to enter.
However, someone wants to visit the enemy again.
Some claim that the temples that they want to destroy are the temples they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The original lab is the largest temple complex and monasteries in Western Ukraine.
It is located on the top of the Old Mountain, 70 kilometres from Ternopol.

Macedonia is ready to vote at the EU-NATO referendum, subject to the change in the country's name.
The Agreement on the Renovation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with the neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its neighbour to call Macedonia, taking into account such a call for an attempt on the same Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, politician: "By means of this agreement Macedonia or North Macedonia has the right to a better future, a hope for public change.
And Greece will uphold the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy at all."
On behalf of the country, the right-wing social democracy is represented in the head with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the president of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Cvetina Chilimanova, Macedonia has no reason to enter into the EU - it is sufficient to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current Socialist Government is forced out of the country to change the name of the country.
But this decision would have a negative effect.
First of all, I lose sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fai Dullgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was on its way.
The choice of Macedonian citizens will determine the future not only for the Balkans but also for Europe as a whole."
