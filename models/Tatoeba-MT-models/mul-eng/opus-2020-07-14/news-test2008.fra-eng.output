Inflation in Europe has been on food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 countries of the euro area were more important than forecasts, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the Office of Statistics of the European Community located in Luxembourg indicated.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the director's interest rate by saying that the decrease in interest, with the rise in prices of raw materials and the reduction of unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, this is the catch 22 for the ECB: "the need to prevent inflation" in order to no longer intervene on this subject.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record over the last 12 years and in Spain, it is raised from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has resulted in a rapid increase in food and energy prices.
Cereals market rates increased by 88 per cent and soybeans have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products has also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global oil price increased by 52 percent and, last month, a black barrel cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will go from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent but, in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the rate of inflation in 12 months remains around 3 per cent, however, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent in the next 3 to 4 months.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the management rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz's youth Alliance has increased significantly since December. Since 2002, it has now had the largest number of participants, while Gallup (Societal Research Institute) has never seen such low socialist support before, i.e. 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Four of the Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrat Alliance) are below the level of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
On some faithful voters to vote, the number of two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate as compared to the lowest point in the past, the proportion of those who judged that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been so high, it has increased to 41 per cent and 46 per cent in addition.
After the more optimistic prospects of the spring and the latter summer, families are more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is planning an increase and only one tenth is planning to improve the situation.
In December last, 71 per cent of the respondents, namely a majority who had never seen the previous Gallup polls, decided that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of the researchers have confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsany, while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent did not trust the Prime Minister and 27 percent did not trust the President of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political change is the proportion of society, thinking that the satisfaction of the Prime Minister could be treated without change of government.
While 35 per cent of the candidates wanted the Government and the Prime Minister to remain in office after the end of October, this rate is currently only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) estimates that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
In the question of vote, 60 per cent of the polls replied that they would definitely vote and 20 per cent of the additional said they would probably vote.
To compare, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate, and according to current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would not have the right to enroll in higher education, 79 per cent would not have the cost of consultation and 84 per cent would not have the cost of living in the hospital.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote at the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and housing costs at the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by about twenty percent
The hypermarkets introduced in the Buddhist trade triangle have maintained the average increase in prices of 16 per cent in the last year to the difference that this year's VAT rate has not increased.
Article of the Napi Economy (Economy daily)
This year, in the Budaörs trade triangle, the usual Christmas pane also increased by 16 per cent on average, an increase of a net value of more than a thousand forts was shown in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "who had already been involved" in the major food stores in December last, have not increased significantly compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items bought just below nine thousand Forts last year now cost more than ten thousand Forts.
The daily Panel in the ordered hypermarkets exceeded 91 forts, at least ten thousand fort.
And the highest value of the panel was 10,573 forts.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forts.)
The prices of the Union and of the living fish remained almost at the level of the last year, but the prices of the dende, night and pavot increased significantly.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread was followed by the data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, in Auchan, only one kilogram of bread was found.
Competition did not lower the product price below 200 forts.
It was also surprising to see in this hypermarket that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forts, so it would not cost only 257 forts for the marked bottle.
This year, according to Panier daily, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora was the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily Panier of 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the last year's best basket and the last one's smallest card, we find a difference of 12 percent, while the difference between the last year's smallest card and the last one's worst one is 21 percent.
Prices increased from 1,480 tonnes to medium.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 averages, while considering that the impact of the increase in VAT rates had already been noted in Christmas prices last year.
This process made trade complicated, the hypermarkets could not clearly determine which margin to apply on products as long as they were unable to provide for the impact of change in consumer prices.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, it is likely to lose a large profit on the market adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the daily Panier was so excessive that the best pane was more than 1,720 for the 2006 value, whereas the difference between the smallest panes was only 844 for.
This year, the difference was not so excessive because the highest value of the basket was over 1,630 for the last year and the lowest price for the sheep also increased from 1,284 for the last year.
By approaching the two seasons of Noël, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, and in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods increased by more than 30 per cent in hypermarkets.
(This does not strongly confirm KSH data: for certain first-needed foods, the Statistics Institute found a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, the flour and the egg.)
According to the daily Panel of the latter, this appears almost absurd as the price level of this product, already well over 10 per cent in the last year, has increased to more than 10 per cent compared to the base.
According to the indicators, flour suppliers take a stronger position than job suppliers because they have succeeded in accepting the brutal increase in prices also by the multinationals.
In the trade gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, most customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarkets.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the food from long conservation by pallets.
Wednesday mornings of important issues were formed in the case of three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the number of business is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to polling companies not even to reach the number of business planned, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer products.
Many hospitals make the economy of the disinfectants.
More than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals this year.
The hospital's hygiene conditions, the number of beds, the overcrowding of medical personnel do not help prevent infections, says the doctor at the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make the economy of the disinfectants.
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed with Janos hospital traumatology.
The antibiotics resistant bacteria have been detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The disease was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury of a serious car accident is from the hospital but shortly thereafter it has to return because of an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in its body.
Up to 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen agent were reported to the National System of Nocomatic Monitoring, said Karolina Böröcz, a doctor at the National Center for Epidemiology.
It is known that this is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest of us have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) have been caused by the MRSA, i.e. by the anti-methicillin-oxacylline-acidic acid-resistant staphylococcus.
A third of the people are carriers of Staphylococcus gold (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
The infections caused by SA (such as anginas, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, which are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used in an excessive or inappropriate way, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a highly resistant bacteria that will rapidly spread into poor hospital conditions.
In the event of poor temporary or prolonged operation of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on the elderly, small weights or a weak body.
According to the director of János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily routine.
There is no need to confuse infection with the epidemic, we don't find MRSA alone or we're not looking for it, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SA resists antibiotics.
"These diseases are isolated, the carer puts rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
In particular, hospitalised patients are examined if they are MRSA carriers, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
The removal of the sample is not in the mode
The vast majority of infections caused by the MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs especially in hospitals and residents of elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalised diseases and immediately isolate MRSA's infectious diseases.
However, microbiological removal is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It is important to know that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
In most cases, only if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the doctor in charge of the epidemiological center has reported.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the management of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotics, in other words, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take into account.
The implementation of microbiological removals is even more rare in ambulance care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy of the disinfectants.
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA spreads from one disease to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put gloves and protective masks. However, important defects are detected in hospitals as well as in this area.
The MRSA is spread by infection transmitted by inhalation of gouttelites and contact. However, because of conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the infected disease cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while in the end of the epidemic, diseases should be removed from each other at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on the disabled, lack of nurses, are numerous, and the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures, the number of infections is less demonstrable or the spread of pathogens may be blocked.
Governmental project against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection is an excessive cost for social security cases, which is why we are fighting this infection all the time.
In England, for example, the Government has set up a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSA.
According to the published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a growing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in trouble.
The official statement on the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd round was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd rounding, leaving his post since, who had broken a pit by causing his last Tuesday death, had been in a state of shock or confusion, had communicated on Friday Attila Morva, a spokesman of the public ministry of the capital after the relevant finding had been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation that the ex-commissioner had not consumed alcohol before being placed at flight.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd round commission broke up a 55-year-old man who met him when he turned, with his personal car, into the 22nd round street of Kossuth Lajos. The man wanted to cross the road without passing through the passage for the piertons.
(In addition, the fact that it was crossing the road outside the road for pets does not constitute an alarming circumstance, according to the Road Code, a vehicle entering a vehicle must be allowed to pass the pets.)
The pieton died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this incident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his resignation because, according to the police report, the incident was very disturbing.
The investigation on this case is conducted by the Park of Budapest's investigations.
Attila Morva also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Hungarian Finance, and Martha Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed, on Friday, in Budapest, three agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and the environment and energy infrastructure.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgeting of transport and environmental projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund of which a credit contract of EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties, this time the signed contract concerns the use of EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also relates to the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, and the state budget will use this package first in the context of the research and development project to be implemented at Debrecen University.
In the negotiations, draft metro line 4 was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would review the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary had completed the details of the metre financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated €8.4 billion to the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of all Europe has turned to this country of the Balkans mentioned in the past.
What, or who has bought on this EU market that is always the least expensive but who will soon become?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is the most popular destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the market.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamproo and Vitosa and, on the seabed, Albena, the golden sands, the old Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more are looking for an apartment in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also increase the interest of investors and they will also have more to buy in the very small area of Russia.
Sofia, capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office surfaces promise the highest rate of amortisation.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf parks and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer season and winter season, also in the two other seasons of the year.
The most vigilant investors are already in large numbers, for example in the Bansko region.
According to analysts, people who buy a furniture in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their life, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the other side of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski stations, we meet traditionally many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers divide into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who want to install are buying renovated furniture, at a price ranging from EUR 50 to EUR 100 thousand, or from broken old houses, at a price ranging from EUR 5 to EUR 15 thousand, which is then renewed.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, stores and generally the local physician.
The second group includes the purchasers of secondary residences (since December last, Bulgaria has been mentioned among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who are looking forward to achieving a higher mean or long-term value.
The price of capital property increases without delay because of an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, staff meetings are held on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after official opening, the negotiations of Ministers on the post-2012 climate regime will continue.
The experts and political men from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap intended to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this point, lively discussions are being held between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also noted that, for the moment, they did not wish to discuss accurate figures, but were ready to sign an agreement on the reduction by 2020 of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels.
Another important issue of the Conference is whether developed countries are committed, without emission reduction, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was also signed on assistance to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Governing Council composed of 16 members likely within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac es Profet (Markhe and Profet).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an arable ship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU would undertake to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20 per cent compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the post-2012 Agreement, and was ready to reduce up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to take appropriate commitments to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatories of the Kyoto Protocol had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and the total of 15 EU members of this period had been committed to 8 per cent less.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 6 per cent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Department of Environment.
The issue is large in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy should be put into place within two years, but the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be repealed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system that was highlighted in the new IPCC report, international scientific bodies, which received the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize for Climate Change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army on YouTube
The British army units, on the video-sharing site, communicate recordings made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been operating for YouTube: the special units operating in Afghanistan spend video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These registrations, with the help of minimal cameras mounted on the cache, are controlled in the general area of air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or to the Internet-based compatriots.
The political message is inconceivable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net this way and their "chain" has been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The Department of Defence has been registered under the name "defencehead Quarters" in early 2007 and has announced videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Department of Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission and Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the Air Force, the videos were passed on the network to recruit. According to the Department of Defence, they were also used to inform the general public about the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this way does not cost virtually anything in relation to regular television recruitment publications, which are communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, in consultation with defence. Instead, it also inevitably carries a political message because it is in a special way justifying the well-founded welfare of military operations decided by the Government.
The Americans made a game
The army is embroiled because, despite the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the site of division that also presents the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films a little hypocrisies, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never present the bloody side of the battle.
In addition, many videos have already been on the network presenting operations areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that have been carried out in a real mission, but the British army has only been engaged in carrying out these videos for a while.
The Americans make the recruitment a little different by using the American's Army-Fussile game free of charge. In this game the player can put himself directly at the place of soldiers in the context of a more or less real simulation.
Tombala Christmas and benign in the departments
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sensitive: instead of celebrating Noël, she will hold an annual final meeting with her colleagues, who will be able to say yesterday in 2007 by taking benets and coffee.
Another department will organize a festival with live music, another will show officials with a tomola and will offer a glass to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Fate, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, thus enjoying power.
Public authorities also prepare Noël.
This year, Noël's biggest festival will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Department who will be invited.
In Noël, the Orphelins, the children of the lost soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides for a budget of 25 million Forts to create an environment for the end of the year.
In comparison with other departments, the National Development Agency (NDP) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will be held.
The GKM festival will be held in the future House with a total budget of 4,320,000 forts and, on the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this festival, Noël's environment will be very strong, there will be actors and also a tomola.
The NFN Christmas cost 4,700,000 forts and was organised Wednesday in the National Justice Council (OIT) building with concerts and dinners.
The rent of the room cost one million dollars, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFN service is invited to another Christmas festival organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the offer management company.
The building of the Theater de la Gaîté was celebrated for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to join the responsible.
The custom is not mandatory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, who, instead of a Christmas festival, held a ball at the occasion of Saint Luca on December 7.
The ILO has not made them pay for the use of its rooms.
That was five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the night stay was not of any obligation to this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities prepare a party on the subject.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party to its employees, in their walls, for 400 000 Forts.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his colleagues to a Christmas party but to an annual working meeting.
Hundreds of people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat benign, the press service has been announced, the party will not cost as well as 350 000 forts.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his colleagues to take a glass in the hall of the Ministry of Local Communities and territorial planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas festival in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It is worth spending 2,500 Forints per invitation including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of Janos Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
The official nature of the scheduled party is strengthened not only by the Minister's statement but also by the time of the party that took place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will arrange a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas festival will not be held.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Forest, and according to the Department's communication, 1,000 people per person are calculated for hundreds of guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail where only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are accompanied by a few kind words of welcome from the Minister following a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate all for Christmas, have communicated to [origo] their respective press services.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas festival.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the gray magic gather together
The trade unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will, on Friday, constitute their count committee responsible for the coordination of the fixed-term strike on Monday.
Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Cases Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly result in significant gaps in the movement, as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and BKV employees (common transport company) will also be grave up to 13 hours.
The Link Syndicates will find out, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday nights' sleep organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA strike committee - MOSZ will also be formed, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
Sadie, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the date of the vote in Parliament on the Health Cases Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Cases Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to the strike.
On the contrary, if the law is voted, the Committees of Appeal will meet and decide to take it.
According to the order of Monday of the National Assembly, the vote on the Health Cases Act is likely to take place only late at night.
As a result of Monday's drought, important doors are set in circulation: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning a part of the common transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volan companies are likely to be arrested.
At the same time, in different parts of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many civil unions and organizations have joined in the appeal to the strike, the list of them has been kept up-to-date on the League's website.
Some organizations report that they have been crying for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary halt to work.
Until Thursday after noon the MÁV (Hongrois Ferry) and the Free Chemical Syndicat (VDSZZZ) have failed to reach agreement on minimum services, or, near Christmas parties, more and more are those who take the train.
According to current communications, the joint transport of Budapest will take place from the start of service until 13 a.m., Budapest's airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Energy and Thermal Energy Syndicates of the League will provide a four-hour strike, the Trade Union of Teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers have called for a strike at 2 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.
The National Association of Doctors will make a strike across the country in exchange, the Health and Social Sector Syndicate (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will be a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League requires that the Government withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the deduction to be applied from the next year is introduced in several stages.
The third claim requires a guarantee, in respect of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the functions that are due to be carried out in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Chemicals Syndicate (VDSZZZ), accompanied by the Ligue Syndicats, the Ministry of Economics and Transport's proposal for secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the Political Analysis and Risk Division (RISK Analysis Division), the activities of the Hungarian Guard last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarszágér Mozgalom (Moving for a Better Hungary) increased, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic confrontations can result in the deterioration of the already existing ethnic tension between the population of the Tsigane and non-Tigane of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, which is certainly aimed at causing this situation, is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have held the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups which have based a political strategy on the difference between the Czechs and the Hungarians."
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely to occur, they say.
However, according to the research institute, with the increasing attention of the Hungarian and international media to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, "the image of Hungary has significantly deteriorated abroad, particularly with regard to the country's confidence in the stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme rights groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007, giving the name "national self-defence association".
"The common treaty of these gatherings is that they are defined as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their allies to defence missions (distances, national defence, order defence), armed, if necessary, to the extent possible, by calling on the police, the army, in other words the state," they added.
They noted that all was followed by the method that, based on the framework of the policy society and the parties, seeks to eliminate different political ambitions under a civilian perspective.
The emphasis on the civil nature and the status of association is therefore not only on the legal aspects of the registration of such associations in court but also on the political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk of proximity relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries refer to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some border countries want to justify their anti-honorous policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Europe, and political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard, for example, is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many problems of Rome that have emerged in a village of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the Bulgarian guard.
In favour of these events, UNBD decided to set up a guard by stating that the organization's objective is “national self-defence”.
According to them, in the last 17 years, the Turks have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had led to lively discussions in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations on the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defenses, we can read in the warning of the risk of Political Capital.
At the request of the Telecommunications Agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis has been published every year and if events could have an impact on the risk change, they will inform the public opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of the festival and, around the parties, it has become able to reorganise the working days in which the number will decrease next year.
Festivals are no longer uniform in the EU and in the United States.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as holiday days.
Holidays are often related to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year is also a day of rest, the last of which is so much more so that the revealings can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we have on all eleven Christmas celebrations marked in red.
March 15 is a national festival, in memory of the 1848 revolution, as well as on October 23, 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our status, May 1st is the festival of work and November 1nd and November 2, we remember our family and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or other religious festivals rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, he has become able to reorganise the working days in cases or only one working day before or after the red marked festival.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has set out a special regulation on the days of the replacement of the previous days or following the festivals.
The Act applies to all employees and to all employees, employees and persons working in the public service.
However, it is not worth the services companies, the institutions return without interruption and in service, by their occupation, and also for rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year: from 24 December, life ends almost throughout the country because, according to experiences, most people do rather than spend extra hours or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year in their home.
The following year many festivals fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay in their four days of absence.
Saturday, April 25, will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, 2 May.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday, 18 October will be a work day replacing Friday 24.
On the contrary, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the festival because since December 24, the whole world will take a break without stopping even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six subtle things that can be terriblely misleading to colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that treat us almost any more: these are things that "make" the day out of work.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these bugs or are faced with the challenge and are conscious of the ambiguity, causing damage to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you we called you from the marketing service," said one colleague.
What did you do for a date?
The best thing is to relax and try to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the most current solution).
In most cases, the matter is settled with excuses.
Before you have criminal explanations, it is helpful to reflect on how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you buying something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more exciting than wanting to get a file, a office tool or the phone, and you don't find them anywhere.
You remember when you saw her, you put her on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you find in hazard your style that you thought you lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, but they have reason to be angry with you because they've been doing their best.
Don't waste your bags, put it in your pocket, because it can be improvising that it has no more and that you need it all the time.
Your colleagues' private life bosses?
There are no good ways to stop the forces that promote themselves.
Who did what, with who?
And why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his secret secrets with you, don't lose his confidence!
Keep the information shared with you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even if your colleagues are also present.
You're going to say you're sick with no reason?
When you call the office and tell you that you're sick of a headache, because you feel bad or you like you need some rest on that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your final mission must be done by someone else at your place.
Don't be rude to your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you won't work tomorrow or that something can happen that would force you to stay at your home, don't forget to prevent your boss and your colleagues to avoid being surprised by your absence tomorrow.
Freuding, enriching, telephone
You're stuck in your work, but your fellows' wealth is driving you crazy?
Did you become, without wanting, witness a telephone discussion that you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with loud applause, singing, discussions (which you handle above their heads), feet beatings, big words or disquietings expressed with a loud voice.
They may be disappointed even if your colleagues are not involved in a project (reading, design, organization).
You accuse the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send an important e-mail or message, do not charge anyone for this forget!
Don't put it on the account of the possible chaos in your office or your burning colleagues!
Recognize if you have made a mistake and if this has brought in consensuals for others, repair the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your mistake, fix the ignorance!
You feel too much at your desk?
Setting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Do not put a comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by being properly dressed, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to answer to the wait, you're no longer interested
We slowly move in the usual mouth in the morning.
At the same time, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin whose electronic effects are associated.
I'm gonna go up to the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the low comes to accompany the tone of the whole time, then a female choir has joined it as a real bee.
Mr.2 broadcast the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
The Hungarian music life has not made us angry for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
But now it seems that the mouth becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi's appearance, the few new interesting productions born from the Hungarian digital landscape start slowly to change the overall picture and, despite the new mode of the garage rock that opened the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is a new under the sun.
Balázs Zzäger arrived from Pécs and he played himself in Yonderboi's group before he left on his own way, perhaps because "there's no place for two feet in the same chair."
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz alliance, electronic dance music and pop, began to be known when he was entrusted with the composition of the film's audiotracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the van2 magazine mentioned their first album in 2002 among the five most important discs in the Hungarian market and announced by Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the only producers of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the West.
Zagar and his entire group became undisputed "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to take this label well.
The group has responded as necessary, it has come up with a new and better disk.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new ways for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line from the old group of Pécs de Balázs Zzáser.
We are well along with the reference to flight but on the side of air music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a true tube for radio, Mr.2 Pethúfi, spreading from a few popular music in the morning, began to introduce the melodys of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian songs (underground Divas).
It's all right, then (?).
hvg.hu is the subject of questions by Balázs Zzáser.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: Is your music well maintained by watching a certain cup?
Zzzeer Balázs: The music term referring to a certain cup does not tell me a big thing.
For me there are two castles in light music; no mainstream or underground, no alternative or pop but commercial music and sound music.
Music is alternative, underground can also be drugs and made only for sale and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere, too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign public, is it that one or the other is more open to your music?
Zs.B.: In the outside, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
People go to concerts and not only young people of a decade or twenty years of age but also older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the public's role in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously happy to see people come more and more to our concerts.
But we've never done music for the market.
For us music is not done to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The public's role is more important to concerts or the mutual influence already works, but it is understood only in the inexhaustible changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to answer the public's expectations, you wouldn't be interested anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and did a career instead of west.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his path even if some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and the laissons are spreading.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi because we are a couple of people to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm tree of Mr2 Pethúfi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many are those who heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have deliberately opened up to a larger cup?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube so we could sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to hear the most difficult sounds and themes addressed throughout the disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why - What was the line?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a chorale of the gay kind.
We had the idea of composed this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
This was made up of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Ennikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This piece had existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was something else in this song.
The conclusion of the agreement touched the voice of the song.
I sang the same song the night the girls learned later.
I had almost immediately, and everything was terriblely spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no one alone (except one Judy Jay's only short), they don't have a single role, they sing all together and they don't sing more than music, so music does not just accompany their song.
They were back on the scene too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind the plan is only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we must forget a bit of our ego, forget who comes from, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, carry us.
I would also like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs have made you the most work?
Zs.B.: In fact, no matter what the music creation process is, we had more difficult puzzles in the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work long, and then, little by little, everything was put in place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "left" this disc.
At this point, it is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is at risk for billions because of its inferiority complex
A dissimulation fraud.
This is how his ex-employee employs the French geent the General Society, owner of the Czech Bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost five billion euros for him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is just a big player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered as impossible.
Unlike all the big bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He's fragile," they let him hear his superiors who denounced him to the police.
However, if Kerviel's position is taken into account by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man have resulted in a profit of EUR 1.6 billion in the last year.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he said in the deposit.
The last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he heard the occasion from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February, according to which hypotheses said "subprimary", given to low-income clients or even those who had encountered difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I got my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides, adding that he didn't, of course, have nothing to keep for himself."
In all the questionnaires, he claimed that the reports were incorrect so as not to be disproved.
He managed to stop his superiors, although the Eurox race began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who's risking nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Not at all.
"I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where's his willingness to risk so much?
He did not come to his post but gradually.
He started working with the General Society in 2000 just after completing his studies at Lyon University.
His annual salary was about $111,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader, and in 2005, he became independent with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after his entry into office, he won his first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won a half billion euros by placing down this title in London's attacks.
And the mechanism was broken - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
"It was like a cloudy effect," he said to the police.
But the superiors were at the root of everything, or rather, they doubted.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
But that's when it comes to the beginning of the year.
He loses a billion euros a day.
In mid-January, after weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he comes to work, he's no longer employed in the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that it lost EUR 5 billion because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious of his family.
" Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn't take vacations is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic on the occasion of obtaining 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government's ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech Crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is almost half of the total amount that Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion lines issued from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial means that the Czech Republic can obtain in the framework of these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a total of 90.8 billion dollars in next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must use financial means to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Enterprises should obtain financial means for introducing new technologies, research in industry, but also for introducing new more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the EU's most successful beneficiaries.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal confirmed yesterday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion dollars).
But later he was released and was assigned to reside in his garden near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, depending on 1997-2002, will be or will not be again in prison for the moment, according to the AP agency, it is not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will leave Germany to end his sentence, or be angry again in prison.
Four years ago, the Court proved that Germany regularly transferred the government's money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
It was a business of fictitious companies and accounts were actually owned by members of his family and his closest relatives.
A part of this money was transferred to the funds that Germany had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's right.
The statistical budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this Government and accepted by the majority of governments without the support of the opposition.
For the past year, a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech socialist party - ČSSD, because it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford it.
In contrast to the debate before the vote on the Government ' s statement of defence, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Members has adopted no problem with this law, which, although most influential, is a habit.
There's a kind of paradox.
Whether or not it is wanted, each chapter and each article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is part of the policy, which is hidden behind the competition for power against government and opposition.
This latter is more media-friendly and is therefore more attention given to media.
Political men's disputes are much more interested in opinion than in broken figures.
The national budgets of the previous socialist governments suffered three maladies that the current budget could not be fixed at the same time:
The first is the important part of the mandate fee imposed by the law, composed not only by retirements, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" grouping the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a weak economy, resulting from the first evil.
The third obstacle is the lack of public finances, i.e. the lack of cities and communities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the largest area.
This is public and relatively controlled.
The real bomb is a short time ago, it's the lack of cities and communities.
Many of the mayors often issued obligations, which gradually end up with their municipalities, in order to obtain money from taxes, tax and bank loans, from new sources of investment.
In the past years, they have been able to compensate for these debts by mass sales of distribution systems, including energy from the State in the form of privatizations.
Today, they have no more than this source.
If it is only official and verifiable facts, it is found that:
Our economy has been through for many years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD does not need to wait for it.
It was a unique opportunity for the subsequent governments of this party to regulate public finances.
But instead, they claimed the State more and more.
Other countries, with some exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a far more reasonable way than our Republic.
It is a manifest shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are part of countries which are, at a global level, the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes that have, just in recent years, been unsatisfyingly affected.
Although it has been able to eliminate some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, if a decline in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the retirement system will not take place soon, then all policies will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power, it will not be managed.
In excess of punishment, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between retirements and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which makes normal costs rest at the costs of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous Governments had not spent all their money.
If we really do not want policies to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only afford the equivalent of what it has to do with tax and tax rights, the peace necessary to prepare new reform laws.
There is only one of the latter who will gradually achieve a balanced statistical budget.

Banks want to settle the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swedish and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than hundred billion dollars will be placed on monetary markets through savings.
It will be for banks to sell, through a system of deposits, interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the American Federation will send $40 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks and will also provide $24 billion.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of Individual States have decided to take action to prevent the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could afford," writes Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a resuscitation in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-refunded loans, especially in the United States.
The analysts are still waiting for billions of other losses.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is that they must really appreciate what can still be done," says ABN economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central Banks fear that, if banks themselves will have difficulty access to loans, they will seek more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and fill the American economy in a recession that could affect the economic growth of the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after it failed to lower the interbank rate of London, named Libor, used to invest in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, although the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and England had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a new downturn of interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting company.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the Central Banks will not contribute to the crisis, as it does not address the main problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists' discussions are incredible
Global climate change is perceived black mainly in developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of planetary recovery.
This time, the criticism was addressed at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, it is not clear, he stated that the discussions of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the contemporary and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a set of words, focusing on solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President pointed out, when he presented his book, that his subject was of great importance to him and that he was so committed to this matter.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, because he said, "I often find that the characterization of my opinions".
Now, interested people can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he did, in his opinion, have sufficient provisions to edit such a book.
In fact, it is an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics and it is also an economicist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following thesis: the climate is constantly changing, its changes are normal, therefore there is no opinion shared by all researchers on the planetary recovery, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are therefore no threat and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate evolution are useless, ineffective and unacceptable.
As far as the experience of a comprehensive regime is concerned, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels as a danger to freedom.
In response to the people's questions, he explained several times that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already discussed this matter two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving permits in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline and have failed to renew their former driving licence, with the validity at the end of the year.
We are the last day where people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are able to grant them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry was not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would not be allowed to use the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their permit to drive mainly those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a decrease in the number of requests for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are subject to requests and the number of requests for renewal of the permit has increased this week.
Marie had approximately 2000 clients per day.
There's a cry of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not renewed their driving permits yet.
The delivery of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for delivery within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to perform the mandatory renewal of the driving permit by the end of the year and will obtain the road without a valid permit, will be at risk from January.
The debtor will be obliged to pay at least two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also deal with the crime by resorting to a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine falls to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, it was likely that even a person would not have to travel.
She could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called upon the authorities to be moderate and to impose no more than 1000 amendments.
However, according to the Department of Transport's spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of an amendment of tens of thousands.
The permit for driving is, he says, a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
This is not like the identity card that, she must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should grant their driving permits.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the appropriate municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also obliged to progressively renew other types of driving permits.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 have yet to be renovated for three more years.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 shall be expressed in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties for detectives with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Kojörík, former police officer accused of conniving with David Berdich's gang, will be sentenced to thirteen years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has therefore condemned them in a definitive manner by reducing their penalties for 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime risked 14 and 12 years of imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only one appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged with this case, he is only waiting for the first sentence.
However, he has already received other punishments, which the amount exceeds 16 years of prison.
He can't get more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal recognized that there were 19 persons involved, and today the Supreme Court dealt with 16 appeals.
Since the start of the investigation, the majority of the accused had filed the charge by claiming that it was a manipulating case.
According to the Court of Justice of the Central Boheme, the members of the police, after an agreement with Berdich, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various detentions and helped the gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang distributed 30 per cent of the larcin in Opava and Koırík.
In the charge, there is a question of the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999-2001.
In most cases, armed flights with victims have been seriously affected by health, but also by the abuse of power by a public agent and the banned weapon.
In domestic investigations, the police have, in effect, discovered illegal pistols, boots with a steel knife, a sawmill for direct laser-drawing or a munitions.
According to the allegations, the gang is rich in tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty people in this trial, the courts have already recognized other flights to Berdych and a number of others.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main audience, for the moment, has avoided Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The Price of Replacement for Children: 12 million
Igor Veleba's lawyer wants to get 12 million crowns more expensive from the Trebič hospital.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the parents and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the Ondréj Dostal hospital is not absolutely in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostal said at the end of the hearing.
"To make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report of which the opposite party ordered the drafting.
We're going to check if he's at some Explanatory Value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostal pointed out.
The amount should be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jablonov asked for a million crowns every month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the university hospital centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting the negotiations on democracies.
According to psychologists and psychologists, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different stages and depth.
The situation of stress has been better sustained by men, although they have been faced with reservations that they do not prevent the substitution of new generations.
Women, who remain less serene before the outbreak of trauma in modern times and what is happening right now, have summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Tříbíč on December 9th.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola in Čermák in Príbiyslavie and Veronika in Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablonov.
The governor of Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil gave each 100,000 Korean families a reimbursement of the costs incurred by the mistake of the Tříbič hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are bound by the Civil Responsibility Insurance Act.
In the event of a shortage, they must be in the reserve fund, except that they can ask for assistance from the manager.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively small damages, the amounts calculated on the tables were of the order of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polivka and Lose Valais Kingdom (with the Kingdom of Valaisko)
Bolek Polívka lost the lilege au subject de la marque Valášskáství (Royaume de Valáško).
According to the Regional Court of Ostrava, he was actually used for the first time by King of Valáško, but the project was put on foot by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former co-rapporteur of the actor.
Polivka was not present at the hearing today.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not final and his client will call.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are standing on Bolek Polivka's popularity," said after the trial of Polivka's lawyer.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valajsko are just this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"We've been working for almost ten years.
He said he was looking for money and setting it up for events."
According to him, it's money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They want to stop our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polivka used the title Valášský kral (Roi de Valáško) for the first time in his television broadcast.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohetý was crowned king in 1993.
But at the time, this was not related to the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of displaying passports from Valášské Kralovství.
From a humorous action to the origin, it has resulted in a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Haribish, of the company Valášské kravoství.
In 1997 Polivka agreed that her name and signature were mentioned in the passport and even proposed to the payrollers on the price of the visit to her farm and theatre.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has only used the new idea published by Polivka in the management issue for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka has certainly helped the project Valášké kravoví," said the judge.
She added, however, that the project's soul was composed of Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intensive manner.
The collaboration between the enemy parties today continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vsetín for Polivka.
From there, however, conflicts began to accumulate between Polivka and Harabiš, who joined with the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st election forever".
The lead role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the mother of Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polivka complained against Harabiš and his company, asking the court to refuse today.
What could lead to the clarification of the case, is the tournament designed for the throne and a half of the princess.
He should be coming out of a new king.
He still didn't want to bring the details and the date.
"We don't want to go fast in bed.
it would be something like the king's defense in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polivka can clearly sign up," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: loss of damageds
In fact, I've never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its quality of rolling was nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, the behaviour and also that of manufacturing could, in some respects, be less than average.
But currently there is on the market its successor to the Peugeot 207 which, it is much better.
As much as the so-called SW cable is still a step further, it remains more than I can think.
When I was testing the classic hackback of the Peugeot 207, I complained for example of the space for the head on the back seats.
While the complaints are over, the cabi cart means that even the big devils will be, in this regard, at ease.
Let's see soon.
I'm going to call the inside very quickly so I don't go too far to repeat.
It's a little bit of a successful design, but it's the only mark on the central tunnel that makes me look poor.
There, I'd love a little more inventive design, given that the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and the time when we could complain about sittings or too short folders is revolutionized.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly in relation to model 206.
As far as space is concerned, the increase in the dimensions of the cart is also sensitive here.
The Combi also sees the lack of space above the head mentioned above.
A buffer in the buffer
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage support.
I need to assess it as very accessible (also thanks to the oil pivoting back) and a rather easy reach.
The light spaces are made up of adjoining elastiques that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not complicated and can be extended as long as it is able to have enough heavy objects.
But we stop at the volume.
This does, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather medium number relative to competition.
Share the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
If it is compared to 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, it is found that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind it, the difference is 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a purse, this figure is almost critical.
However, if I had to take advantage of it, I would mention the bottom of the box after the rollover of the files of the seats perfectly legally, or a very low margin.
120 horse-dried horses on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an Otto four cylinder engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hackback.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it moves well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Skoda that often gives the impression of having an escape pot with a mirror, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Rates per square inch
The price of the vehicle is not accessible to all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a very well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litres up to 329 900 Kč is still affordable.
The vehicle we tested cost from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
But, we have more airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic glazing, automatic command of the back windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs up to the account 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to Fabia's price and you will get a very similar figure.
So there's more to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is wrong
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is growing, causing concern for the evolution of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans into a series of obstacles is currently under way.
British schools even note cases where conflicts between immigrants and native people of origin become violent.
The case of Kent of the North, where the ongoing and immigration conflicts of Slovak origin began to intensify, well illustrates the problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, girls and boys between the students were transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation is so far away that the police stopped in Chatham a Slovak woman who was hit by a bar to make a ten-year-old student.
The prisoner defends himself by affirming that the boy has been insulted by racist issues.
The police also had to intervene after the attack against a Slovak immigrant by two teenagers.
The young girls had apparently addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a young man screamed at the bus stop and started to crack us up.
When I told him to stop, he answered by pummel and pears and then discovered his legs," he described another unpleasant adventure as a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went on to qualify for the conflicts with immigrants to fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between indigenous and immigrants begins to tend.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students frequent British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
All you expect from your loved ones can be fulfilled if you make a good choice.
Sweet beaches and white beaches like snow, high valleys or then a calm sea like a stench.
Palms and everything included with servers that offer you on the beach a pizza, ice cream, or some fresh cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf course and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you are not going to find this list only in its integrity, but rich.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the basing of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus qualified him as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havane became the depository and transshipment of the treasures that the Spanish had flown and transported to Europe.
Then came the American weather.
The National Hotel has been elected from the beginning of the 20th century.
This is Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American mafia, who built it, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under ban) was approved and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-level furniture also moved cars, which belonged to the cult symbols of the last 50's, around the broad boulvards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near the Havane, and, in Cojemar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of the whole America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Hawaiian Bodeguiita.
In the National Hotel bar, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktails of your choice.
And these cult cars are still traveling to Hawaii, because the jigolis and the bazaars that have been imported for a long time have been in a cold and wet climate.
Although the Havane, especially the oldest part, is significantly depreciated, there is no other part in the surrounding areas there are so many beautiful colonial monuments that it has specifically been there.
Other places become more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has its green fire.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have moved not only to Havane but especially to Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and which will be appreciated especially by the amateurs of small trains.
The canne was returned from the plants extended into the sugars on a narrow road by small steam and engine trains.
Their rolling material has not been renewed for decades, and it can be seen in the course of small locomotics where contemporarys are not only in museums.
Where's he headed?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or well on Havana.
It is not to be recalled that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vinjales in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque regions.
Exhaust vegetation puts it on a rocky soil.
Mogots, calculus, and rocks are in short order from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile land being taken in their nests, even its rocks can be covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably the best quality.
You will be able to find the final form of this product if you visit one of the Havane cigarettes factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Germany was turned.
Trinidad
Ancient town was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth is rooted in the beauty and character of this small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which is highly influenced by later French scholars, has not changed in almost four centuries.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the vast mountain Escambray, is such a place that in the last 50's, there was no road that would relate to the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We built nothing, and that's why we didn't do anything else, everyone was happy to have a roof above his head.
If you have more time than a afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the surrounding areas, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the House of Music, which breathes after the sunset, and where the music is only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some describe this bourgeois place in the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way it works.
The two roads that have taken place since Guantánamo have to cross high and dangerous mountains and cross a landscape almost without signs of human activity.
UNESCO has registered the Eastern Republic of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
There is the best chocolate made, in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, she has seen the day almost a hundred years after the spring of Columbus) and since the hill where the old cataau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo is located, there are several tables, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
With regard to the coffee, rhum, cigarettes, the Sirra Master, the Bay of the Turias and the Isle of Pinos, the Tropicala Cabaret, the Holy Father of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the ancient slaves, a number of pages could be filled.
However, as it is rightly said, it is better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, alliances are passive, claiming Americans
The lack of troops and equipment required affects, according to the United States, the continuation of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to defence minister Robert Gates, NATO should pursue a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as it should be, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country are agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing response to the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today also discuss future plans and the coordination of alliances.
While the United States called this week by the Minister of Defence Robert Gates to be more active, Great Britain sees the strengthening of the Afghan Government's authority and the intensifying of development assistance.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is understandable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to enable the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security," said the British Defence Minister Des Browne to the BBC chain.
Twenty-eight per cent
The activity of Afghans is, according to US military data, the most intense of these five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent over the past year, up to 60 per cent in the province of Helmand, located in the south of the country.
The NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, including almost one quarter in the south.
But, according to the United States, alliances have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and team equipment.
In particular, they call for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We must seriously reflect on the specific objectives for the future period, as well as on how to achieve them," said Gates.
The NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has today had similar issues.
"I am not pleased with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have nearly twenty-four percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is not enough," said De Hoop to the Reuters agency at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo for three days.
Who's Passive
These last months also govern the countries involved in conflict on the issue of whether all alliances are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passiveness.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British Sun tabloid qualified German parasex soldiers this week.
"The Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while we fight," Sun wrote in a document filled with photos of German soldiers playing in the table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild was attacked by publishing the photo of a British group during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The debt of the State would fall to a billion in 2009
The charge of a State debt exceeding 84,000 crowns per Czech.
The total debt is charged at 842.7 billion dollars at the end of September.
The Government had planned to employ 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of an economic change in the budget of the State better than planned, the Department has reduced its budget by 152.8 billion dollars.
The debt of the Czech Republic is raised by the end of September at 842.7 billion dollars.
During the nine months of this year, he therefore increased to 40.2 billion crowns.
And since June, it has decreased to 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its data on the debt of the State from the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns per Czech.
Over the last year, the State has committed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the moment, it seems that, due to a less important deficit for the next year, there could be more than one billion crowns in 2009 alone.
The next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikor is similar: "There could be more than one billion in 2009.
The exact date depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene had changed, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed in 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he explained.

The debt of the State is constituted by the debt of the central government and is mainly generated by the accumulation of State budget deficits.
The debt of the State is financed by the assets of the debtor, income securities, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The internal closure of the State increased this year by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt of the State increased this year by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiating State reached the end of September 803.3 billion dollars, and since June it has decreased by 13.7 billion dollars.
The average debt liability of the State rose at 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by interest rates where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand, it indicates that there will be a need to negotiate when retirement reform comes," Piko said.
Better than what was expected.
It was based on the State debt management strategy for 2007 that the Government had planned to employ 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, through a change in the budget of the State better than planned, the Department has reduced its budget by 152.8 billion dollars.
The sum is essentially the deficit of the State's budget, which is due to reach 76 billion dollars this year, in place of the 91.3 billion initial budget.
It is then the maximum resources provided for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion dollars, the 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pensions for 43 billion crowns, and the reimbursement of the European Investment Bank's loans to 1.8 billion crowns.
She would be compared today to a court in Khartoum to have appointed an hour in plenary.
The British teacher who was sentenced to Islam in the Sudan was convicted on Thursday night by a Khartoum court for 15 days in prison and for expulsion, declared his lawyer.
Britain was accused of leaving students from 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet at an hour in the village while all representations of the Prophet of Islam are illegal.
She was capable of a pain in the ass's ass.
This 54-year-old British institution in office at the Khartoum High School in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and accused of assaulting Islam and seduction under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from students' parents to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when this teacher asks his students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class's village village.
“Today names come from the children’s mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 of the 23 children chose Mohamed as a preferred candidate.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the photo of ours following the legend "My name is Mohamed".
He himself had no label on this name, but the problem was simply that of the representative of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught in the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew it well and that he would never do anything that could be offensive to a religious faith, "I regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said only of an "innocent error".
Opinion shared by many students of the institution who describe it as “very careful towards their students” and “who never talks about religion in class”.
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in 14 different English.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a game, for example?
Of course, this is an interpretation question.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, I'm sorry.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences about the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was “in the game”, American counterpart Frank Wisner urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence immediately, but we enter a very difficult period," he added, and it is relevant that "referential tensions exist".
End of the meditation on 10 December
The Troika media, which group the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be back in Serbia and Kosovo once a month.
The future of the province of 90 per cent of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth and last round of negotiations since the troika was charged with a new United Nations mediation in August last.
Americans and Europeans considered their meditation to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the Security Council from granting independence in Kosovo, insisted on continuing negotiations beyond that date.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of onusian administration of Kosovo, the West estimates that independence under the EU's supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim unilaterally if the Security Council does not intervene in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increasing autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in Baden's hotel where these "negotiations of the last chance" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and the future Prime Minister of the province, was one of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “was part of a past that led to murders and deportations”.
‘Effect domain’
Serbian President Boris Tadic estimated that a compromise was always visible, keeping Kosovo's Albanian majority in mind against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade said to reduce a "domino effect" in a region still fragile by the wars of the 1990s.
"To Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
Mardi, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian allies had a right to veto.
'The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word'
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: to the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the statute", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be "in concert" with the West.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland.
He explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were willing to undertake negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old happy age among their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised he would do all he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must deport "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "roadmap" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, chaired by Abbas, would "to conclude a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three major problems in the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian content: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who fled their villages in what is today the State of Israel in the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas stressed that future negotiations would be "global and profound" and would involve all aspects of a regulation, namely "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
On his tour to the court, Olmert committed himself to speaking to them in the future to be "directive and continuous" and to make "an effort to blow them up in the spring of 2008.
Bush set the deadline for the implementation of its Palestinian and Israeli "view of two States" that exist at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in this sense to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, which has been adopted by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a career in the history of the Middle East, especially because it affects the root causes of the conflict and its central aspects", according to Prince Saud in his interview to the daily Arabophone to Saudi capitals.
The police are not responsible for the prosecution.
What exactly happened, Sunday?
Like every time in this kind of fact, official versions and novels are against.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car circled on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, on Louise-Michel Street, in Villaries-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and was about 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green motor of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, so not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, was "to a very live distance".
"She touched the police car on her left after a right-wing refusal," said a policeman.
The control of alcohol on vehicle operators has been negative.
The state of the car (before detaching, star-dry father-chocks, raised father-chocks) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, tomorrow morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère in Givry, announced that he had committed an investigation for "involuntary and non-assistance homicides in person" at the IGPN, co-existed with the Department of Public Security of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation of the IGPN at this stage had removed the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, heard yesterday evening, confirmed “the police version, namely that this mini-moto has arrived relatively quickly on their left”.
Yesterday, a kind of reincineration, without a doubt caused by the freezing of roads on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained closed as soon as the police car arrived to freeze.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsies yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a roommate went fast in Villaries-le-Bel, where the police would have been very quick to leave the places, not preparing for the two young people.
The IGPN, while still cautious, would also remove "all serious errors" concerning this point.
"This is one aspect of the most difficult investigation, which requires more research, which must be very careful," said a police source.
Freedom met with an eye witness from these few moments after the accident.
One of his windows giving specific attention to the scene.
“We are all right down, with my cousin who is infirm at the hospital, to try to rape them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a cop totally hagarded, who was beating.
Two others were trying to encourage one of the young, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension surrounding the scene, and it seems to be certain that the young people were present in the unexpected situation, the police were driven into the car by colleagues who arrived on the premises.
According to this witness, the aid was “about twenty minutes after the police started”.
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
"I will not say that police services have not helped young people.
These young people were helped.
The pumps arrived all the time.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out on his side.
The tension mounts in Pakistan
The Pakistani police have repressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against the emergency measures were injured by the lacymogens used by the order forces, according to the witnesses.
The latter were repatriated by stone jets, hurting the police.
At least 350 lawyers were interviewed.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers were charged and injured by lawyers.
Many would have been interrupted.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's barbarium called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a campaign of some 500 arrests during the week of opposition, human rights fighters and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked in the morning to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multitan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
The movement of lawyers received support from religious parties assembled in the strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which the President urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the state of emergency and the destructions of those who had made a solemn offer to Musharraf'.
''The promise of Musharraf has no more''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly visited by the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It had to speak in the next few days about the legality of reelection to the President, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was elected and replaced.
'All that we have to do is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court', said the chief of the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to remove the army's head and become a 'more' civilian president after the state of emergency was established, said Minister Tariq Azeem's Deputy Minister of Information Monday.
Leaving his military uniform was expected by 15 November, at the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be reported.
In addition, the Pakistani Government has decomposed in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to reside by his Deputy Chief of Arms.
More than one third of the population still remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) is not yet planned, a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows, forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which has liberalized the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still present a 5% to 6% check rate, according to India.
The liberalisation of contraception has also allowed a better "frequency master", according to the Institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women between 20 and 44 years has passed from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births of ten would be well planned today.
Check the monthly average for a couple of five and if possible at the spring season, judged as the most pleasant season for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours to work in space at Scott Parazynski and his teammates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a dedicated solar panel, which is essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risk exit that accumulated the memories of its duration, its distance from the living modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the "brickled" tools by the astronomers to perform the repair.
The problem appeared Tuesday when the astronomers had disarmed the Discovery ship with the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room that was soon to host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frame).
This module is a kind of fitting for the workers.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the team was to move an electricity production module with 17.5 tons of solar panels, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After moving, the crew started re-discharged the solar panels of the module which had a depth of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which spread like gifts, was destroyed about a meter by a cable that collapsed.
Deployment has been stopped so as not to cause further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally required to conduct a control exit from the Discovery vessel, then to repair another solar panel, which the rotation system was defective, were obliged to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to carve over 30 metres of the ordered arm of the ship added to the station to perform repair.
It's one of the best spacewalker in the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very fair, he has the very developed torso and long arms.
Thus, at 46 years of age, this training doctor was responsible for "operating" the solar panel "damaged".
After having specifically inspected the damages, he cut down the false cable and installed types of "talls" on the indominate area.
He was helped by a second spacewalker staying close to the sash and, inside, by other astronomers, Peggy Whitson, the commander of the team.
The tool he used, a tiny hockey channel developed from an island to avoid the electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "brickled" by the astronomers on the side of the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and refurbishing the inside of the station.
After noon, the astronomers enjoyed a half day of detention before today, seven astronomers don't give up the Discovery vessel for a return to the planet planned for Wednesday.
The title of EADS fined in Bourse
The EADS action is currently under way at the Paris Forum, after the Air Force and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion in order to meet the A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Forum.
The group was required to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 following delays generated by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which provides for the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of palling the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, including more than 1 billion for Airbus, announced the home of the mother of the European EADS builder.
As a result of these burdens, EADS will be obliged to announce new performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when submitting its next Thursday quarterly results, adding it without any more detailed details.
The group also indicates that the assessment of new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
To remember, the operational result of EADS fell by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to delays in another programme, the one of the very large porter A380.
Initially, the group intended for the first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The option of the status bar
There will be no delay, Sunday, at the end of the hours: the Russians will make a massive choice for the party of President Putin, Russia.
Confirming their ambition for stability, see authoritarianism after a very busy campaign.
For three days of legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addressed to the electors a message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It is made up of Russia's united list head, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is declared shocking.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to do with the transfer of foreign ambassadors, happy to deliver a new burden on the accused West - his theme of preaching during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
She announces a pressed campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there has never been "no fair elections, even in the time of Elshine".
Following the repression of the last week's demonstrations, the former champion of the world's Escheks Gary Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the Soviets"
Following these without delay, two more open issues are being identified:
- Who will happen to Putin at the presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidency, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have been informed by 23 December.
In 2000 and 2004, Vladimir Putine was unable to fulfil a third consecutive mandate.
But no successor will emerge.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The Head of the parliamentary majority and all the powerful Russian parties who would choose the Government and the President?
Whatever the case, legislation such as the presidential authority has the power to triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have maintained the attitude of the Soviets, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historic Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of Saint Petersburg, says: civil society has taken a break in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the Liberal Reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine re-examined with the model of a patriarchal state, fully accepted by the population as much as this new patriarchalism was not followed by the land, but by a certain economic collapse," said Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “refused fully with personal responsibility” which they had clearly demonstrated after the USS discharge.
"And what good think?"
The phenomenon affects all social issues, including the world of business.
And the administrative elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (over 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonyms of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will no longer vote for extremists.
A 54 - year - old teacher, 54 - year - old Tamara Tcherednitchenko, concludes: “What do you think?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why do they change?"
A Long Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's national archives, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are free of access.
The 47 million files of archives, placed on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were to date available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, on the request of an old victim or his legal assistants.
The 11 States responsible for their management - Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States is over, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitivity information
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be conducted "including on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers," Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
To date, several States, including Germany, have been opposed to the openness of these nominal documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war in practice: finding civilians deported or subjected to forced labor and, if possible, giving evidence of their detention, to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is no fundamentally new expectations for these documents," said Mr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, indo-European bilateral trade has reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU foreign ministers had given their green fire to the European Commission to negotiate free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asian). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached around 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trade partner, according to the figures of the European Commission.
"A free exchange agreement will greatly double the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europe's prosperity," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the ten first products exported by India, explained the European Commissioner. Asian and European genes exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and "10 billion euros of services", said this week by Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regreting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India are rescinded for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion books in five weeks
The Bank of England said that it was likely that the current return of credit concerns would be reduced, and it announced ten billion books at the base rate of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly closed at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over the period, the Bank intends to provide an important proportion of its reserve contribution during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks," she said in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion euros (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE is placing on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These usually occur within a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it is "ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a daily basis with its base rate.
The interbank rate per day was 5,829 per cent.
The rate for three months was 6.6 per cent, a higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England have been charged with an important penalty rate which had discouraged banks from applying it.
According to some of the Chambers, sponsored by the evolution of the euro book course, many would have preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC reject the review of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss articles of the Socialist Law proposal on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "nice" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text referred to a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the National Bureau of the PS, including the increase of 50% of the payroll for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a check-out or renting.
UMP and NC voting against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was held following the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition to the television intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The PS file leader Jean-Marc Ayralut announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft streamlining Finance Act considered by the Assembly next week.
A New Festival Sees the Day
Following many developments in the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia, C3 Presents announced the Vienna Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn's Festival of Music.
"For our company, it is a honor to work with a person who has, no less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 in Billboard.com entrusted Charlie Jones to Billboard.com.
C3 is produced at the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a stable destination for the campsite.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres in about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Also known as Mean Fiddler, director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989 he attended the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracted some 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Festival Latitude of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of the most inspiring event he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"Our planes selected Philadelphia as a market and work together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
“Our discussions with the city and the Commission were motivated and encouraged by this project.
Unfortunately, we are involved in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Happyly, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are trying to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will eventually serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grand Park in Chicago, after being marked in the country of festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenue of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a campaign festival, while we have rather a place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both the impression of a festival in Europe and urban America."
Vineland is near midway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, actively supports the observance of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "if they are sufficiently interesting to allow you to invest in such an event and to welcome a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity to welcome this festival is “very big” at the rate of 80,000 people from Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were launched to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time they went under pressure.
"Vinland will be rocked, but music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the award Top Independent Promotion of the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montréal facing the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood films in Montreal when nothing but Terminator is against...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, condemns the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the roles of the Governor?
"The need to be cautious is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to provide those who will judge the best," he says.
The Course at Festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the film from here.
The course to Oscars has begun.
It will be at all the festivals of the West Coast, whether of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, about presenting the Quebec movies, putting them in value and making sure that the performers are interviewing them.
The age of December had a beautiful wine at 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short interviews to the American Film Institute Festival this month.
Will there be a year's final round in the race? Experts divided by the sub-primary crisis.
In less than five weeks of the end of the year, investors are already breaking their hands while waiting for the arrival of the traditional late-year rally.
However, this year experts are not as certain as they will be.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in February generally has a positive attitude.
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions based solely on statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainty is searching for markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not partners to take advantage of the course during the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the bourgeoiser market is fed by the existence of liquidity, designed to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the impact of exit to quality values both in the long periods and in the shorts".
To this end, they believe that the race will have a rather lateral behaviour, not without flying "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely decline of the Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the risk of stimulating inflationist tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of GDP in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish bourgeoiser index, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this vision so negative.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believed that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points by reorganizing portfolios and traditional contributions to retirement schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the feast of the Constitution (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that flight will affect market trends.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and that "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused by information coming from the European Union with regard to the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst hopes they will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum charges.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are coming back for him."
The expert would include the two large banks and some builders in the portfolio "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
As long as Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, ensures that the hair will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructions can also benefit from this rally, in the case where they are placed.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other structures such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions the month of December was a month lower.
The authentic end-year rally took place in 2003, during which bourgeoisie markets are emerging from the crisis caused by the perception of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 per cent, a 6.68 per cent increase was recorded in December.
It will need to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds on its final year round.
The Popular Bank will open 200 open offices 12 hours a.m. on Sunday
The People's Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These subsidiaries, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since it is the first group that decided to begin to compete on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies up to 20 a.m. and to open the Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20 a.m.
Another group also repeated several times that it wanted to amplify the times of its subsidiaries, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about concluding an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for other agencies to join this initiative that coincides with trade times.
That is exactly what the Bank of the People's Republic is looking for.
To attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street markets selected to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies that have been implemented throughout Spain for about 18 months, as it is not about the opening of new agencies but about a renewal of existing agencies.
To this end, the organization will modernise the branches already in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers from different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the hours is accompanied by a different design inside the suite and a new design, more current, with more light colors.
The bank’s trader, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but the staffing of personnel, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine by agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, like the explanation of Ángel Rivero.
The streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Grand Vija de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and with success apparently, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 subsidiaries.
And 60 others who operate under the World Credit mark, specialized in the case of immigrants, as well as with very wide hours, which open even Sunday and holiday days.
In these PopularMax agencies, they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a large chance of non-financial products for their sale.
' We do not want to compete with our customers,' notes Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Double Telecinco for the first time the value in Bourse de his River Antena 3
We're here.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate from Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the close of the bourgeoiser market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect of his joy was: 'What harms me, it's not the fact that we have increased but that we are less low', he said.
However, he stressed the fact that on a small market, 'we were less down '.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% progression.
This gain stabilizes its loss by 15.66% for one year.
The value of Mediaset's Business Survey (with 52 per cent of capital) and announced by Vocento (13 per cent more) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
Its Antena River 3, which has passed by 1.52% yesterday and has been a drop of 40.5% since January, costing half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies allocated to Bourse is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecabel; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antenne 3 is the fact that we speak of two similar companies.
The fact is that we are able to make, on the same market, what price and how we are able to pay it in terms of hearing. '
Telecinco announced last week that it was scheduled to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as said Giuseppe Tringali, the member of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that manages the group's advertising.
In order to ensure that this data is real, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6 per cent for the current year in its advertising bill compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net invoice of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the period (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Bourse is the important payout that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after buying 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given titles with 33 per cent of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market now gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers has recently reduced its estimate of the benefits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.

Congress approves the transmission of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which has today ended with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation which will develop the new law with a view to its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and concentrate on better regulation designed to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies for the effective functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, as long as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the Heads of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial consultancy services to be provided both for special social reasons and for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFIs), which merge value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of operating systems on financial instruments so that it can be added to regulated secondary markets by multilateral trading systems and order internationalisation systems, which face competition with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services companies to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform to facilitate the control of CMMV.
Through the Congress's Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that indicates that the securities will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument giving rise to the high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated by what has happened with the debt of American high-risk mortgages (substantiated).
In addition, they benefited from the transmission of the direction benefited from the legal delimitation of the functions that students in the Economy may have been able to perform 30 years after 1977, the Royal Decree limiting the professional functions reserved for the economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the media, which will work for an enterprise, which will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and which will be able to provide its product marketing services and attract new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The price index for harmonised consumption increases from five decades to November, up to 4.1 %
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat for incorporating it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that employed for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not available for the time being.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, since it should not necessarily match the final data that will be revealed on 14 December next.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and Economic Minister Pedro Solbes claimed that the increase of 4.1 per cent of GDP in November was a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue on "relevantly high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes stated in the Congrès colulaires that "even though the figure is not good" the difference in Spain's inflation rate over the monetary union continues to be "more or less" than in recent years.
He also explained that in November there was less surprise than during the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We are looking for a figure of around 4%," recognized the Minister of Economics in relation to the data announced today.
Virginia plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
The Northern Rock deposits fell by more than 50% to 12 000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since he was in crisis to the middle of September and had to resort to an emergency loan to the English bank.
At that time, he collected a few records of over 25,000 million books, a figure that is progressively reduced in two and half months due to the failure of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of the money the Government has provided and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would re-name the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of the revenue of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these 18 000 million books until the target of 30,000 million is reached.
The Group of Magnat Richard Branson, known for its creative campaign in the United Kingdom, aims to spend 50 million books (about EUR 70 million) per year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has appointed this week the offer of Virginia's association, with which three other companies participate, including its preference for saving the banknote.
Totana's mother was arrested for a alleged urban corruption trauma
The Civil Guard stopped today early this morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (from the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council secretaries and the chief police officer of the municipality was also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me from May to May Juan Morales, the current right-wing member, and until then the municipal councillor of the mayor, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the Chayenne SER, could be the 'mour' of this treaty.
The agents continue to exploit the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and are not excluded from the possibility of further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption scene discovered early this week, was accused.
As Chayenne SER pointed out yesterday at the counsel of the "people's party" member Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving the house of Morales with important documentation in his possession on the tram.
Moreover, according to the sources of the investigation, the investigation is the alleged failure of the Morales commissions to facilitate the signing of a urban agreement with a constructive Galician company to requisition 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight persons detained.
Bono agrees to be the head of the candidate of the Spanish socialist party for Tolede and to preside over the Congress if they win elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolede for the next general elections and to be the President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
The Spanish Socialist Party's organization secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference following the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of Executives justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
In addition, he stressed that "yes" would be the candidate of the Socialist Group that would preside over Congress if the Socialists won the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who had recently made its decision on 15 November not to present themselves to the next general elections and to abandon his political career in order to devote himself to combating climate change in the university framework.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government had not stopped urging him to return to the political front since he left it two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that, although citizens already knew who would be the vice-president of the economy if the Spanish socialist party obtained the election, his party wanted to announce the President of the Congress in a "transparency act".
If he gets the job, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or criticism" and make "it look more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sadly that Madrid's only place where we can't speak peacefully and quietly is Congress, the President of the Government of the Senate has been interrupted 26 times at times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "not knowing to do" and he did not want to do as if he had already occupied his position so that he would not fall, as he noted, in what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to unmerited persecution both the scepticals of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it is necessary to demonstrate consistency.
It is much more the case for a leader of the movement who is the President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and who is even proposed to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach requires him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed in a decisive way to Spain being the head of the European Union in the non-execution of Kyoto Protocols.
Those who are responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has produced, and why its Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits should be affected, what individual and collective energy economies we will be forced to do, what economic consequences this will result.
That's to say, who's going to sacrifice and who's going to cry to save the planet.
But there's no explanation and there's no explanation.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are imputable.
Costs, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to the hundredth of the essence proposed by the Spanish socialist party seemed to him literally so dangerous in Zapatero that he was forced by the night.
It is to say that it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With words of impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this master is so useful for electoral campaigns that don't talk, who don't complain and who doesn't demand, embezzles meetings and inspires the tension.
Since this is limited only to a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we are moving in a bicycle or we are refrigerating with the event.
The mayor and chief of Totana's local police are arrested for a alleged trauma of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the murchin localities of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Maryie and a suspect hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, have reported the sources of the investigation today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was sent to the city hotel, where there were many agents, who were also present to the Urban Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial Sun and Accommodation.
These three arrests are added to six arrests last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land for citizens so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing after payment of illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are involved in the judicial investigation, as the Court of First Instance has instructed.
The first six prisoners have been brought to court today.
According to sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was involved, as well as the current estate of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuaur, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which they could have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Debt Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of Gendarmerie, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out 11 inspections, the majority of enterprises related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in fact, the owner of a very well-known airline company in the region, who might have played the role of the intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land that have been requalified and its project would have doubled the population of the municipality, which currently accounts for 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of enterprises such as Autesa and Inomonauur, which are engaged in real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Parkings of Vigo in Coruña, Venezuela and the location of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Precomoni, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction materials.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the most important yesterday's comment in Finland's newspaper (certain PISA information head above the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what they published on November 18, the same day when he appeared there, carefully, the criticism of the book Blackburn:
"The content of the course of Philosophy interfered with public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The prisoner of death, a Baccalaureat student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Council, Pekka Elo, asked teachers to adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written on the daily days of Helsinki Sanomat and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the Lycaons."

A colleague provides information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime of a six-month penalty a year.
On the contrary, the flight in a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be only a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for a value up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you drive a car and you make it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less important to participate in a baggage than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participation in a cloudy luggage involves a three-month penalty per year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and CD traffic would involve a six-month penalty for two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without author permission is more than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
To end, if my colleague is in the truth then someone's exaggerating.

My treating doctor spoke to me about one of his articles on foreign research: ' Money produces brain activity, especially if others get less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly wage of workers depend on what the colleagues gain.
The study has been conducted through magnetic resonances at Bonn University, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the neuro-cognition group of Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activity was performed when the participant responded correctly and his companion was absent."
The researchers observed that when the two persons claimed that they received the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was larger.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been actively involved in the war crimes of the Balkans since the Public Ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
Its mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla is angry with the love, because the main officials of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are in this list, which the documentist of the Swiss realiser Marcel Schüpbach takes his title, the list of Carla (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police strike, followed by the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade, New York, who continues to expel criminals and press on the governments involved to restore the circle.
What insurance do I deserve?
Car insurance, which covers the driver's face to the left, involves an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of driving permit, the civil state, the type of vehicle to be secured or used, among others.
Having a car is the main one.
And it's that, choosing the appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is even harder to choose the vehicle model than to choose the appropriate car insurance.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is made by an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the first granted and in exchange becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in case of leftover.
The first is the price of insurance, which is determined by different factors, such as age, sex, the age of driving permit, the civil state, the type of vehicle to be secured or the type of use it is used, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the likelihood of an accident is higher, the rate to be paid is higher.
That is why people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower degree of sistros than they are aware of.
In the same way, according to the census, companies have concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than celibate drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing frequency the probability increases.
They are a number of variables that insurance companies take into account at the time of setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose the car insurance that is best adapted to his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or more insurance types, so that, in addition to adapting to the insurance characteristics, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when entering a contract with an insurance at an affordable price, such as low experience in driving and age.
While the ideal for being well-insured is a risk insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most predictable drivers can opt for a risk insurance with franchise, so that they obtain insurance coverage at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of convention means that the customer pays part of the amount of the left.
"The portion of the amount of the left-hand client will be established according to the value of the first, which will be higher than the amount will be low," said Luis Noguera, the first European official in Spain, online insurance mediator.
Another option is third-party insurance, so that the customer will ensure protection against damage caused to third-party people, but by those caused by their own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A council.
If you are less than 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid the leftovers as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the insurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base price owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the base rate.
"Vonifications and sanctions will depend on the company and its benefits.
If the company had had a good year, it could be allowed to increase the bonus ", Noguera explains.
For more than 25 years, it has become easier for drivers to pass a contract with insurance, as the number of skimmers is reduced through accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose a risk insurance with franchise.
"Only young people can not benefit from the experience of the advance after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once the fear of the news has passed. "
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, since his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are regarded by insurance as being people with the lowest degree of left-handedness, as the majority will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk insurance with franchise (may be EUR 300), or a third-larged insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insurance has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more detracted behavior and have greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to take a more important amount of franchise," judge Luis Noguera.
For deductions a risk insurance with a franchise is preferable (with EUR 150) or a third-larged insurance when the insurance has a high level of bonus.
It should be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of leftovers, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the final eighths
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow have joined the next Tuesday in San Siro to seek out what they lack in order to achieve their respective objectives in closing the champions' language, since it is for the Italians to be first and the Scottish to classify themselves.
The Italians complete ten points and have already qualified for the fifth day with a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfia who has four, does not pass it on to him.
These two matches of Group D will be held a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC has to discuss the weekend of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the end of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, because the Italians will not want to specialize in them, and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will be first and ensure a better crossing in the late eighths.
A failure of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to classify if Shakhtar Donetsk did not get it, but she will not be able to computer it only because with nine points the game returns to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanians will try to impose the evening on the echoes, who have a good hope of classing themselves for the eighth finals for the second time at the League Championships, after having been beat during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extension (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rosoneri' triumph, the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, where Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth finals in order to continue the alliance of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfia, although it is the last and no opportunity to pursue European competition, could reach the third place with a winner.
20,000 people attend the first concert in Vancouver of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, before about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group was released in 2000.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice' (Geri Hallwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place of Vancouver that the group meeting was "flamming".
About 20,000 people have posted tickets to attend the concert, which has been the subject of a video in which the story of the group has been recorded since the end of 1990.
The global meeting and tour coincides with the launch of a new album that repeats their main success as well as two new songs, ' Headlines ' and ' Voododo ', published by EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are mounted on stage by showing the brats the husbands of 'Posh Spice' offered them, the British football player David Beckham.
The sport was in the public that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned it a few days earlier.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham noticed that the British football player "has not seen our costumes, so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
' Sporty Spice ', who is part of the group in 1998 " due to differences between us" and who has caused the group to be dissolved two years later, has also expressed its nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feelings for Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad to have made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she left nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things are arranged and that we appreciate them very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl was shown for the last time in 1998.
To begin, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They count on her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and December 7th).
They'll be in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas business between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A debate on the price of gas firmly between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impacts on fuel exports to Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.S.) are transported by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is closely monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit rates in Russia.
Last year, an alteration between the two had resulted in a decrease in supply to the countries of the United States.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, Russia's gas monopole company, has tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided in Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices in Ukraine in view of its acceptance of payment for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from the Turkmenistann neighbor.
The analysts said this would be a 40 per cent increase in imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the negotiations, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," Ukraine's Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would certainly be related to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major shift between Moscow and Kiev occurred in January 2006, the interruption of the supply of Gazprom for Ukraine.
This has led to the loss of exports to Western Europe, resulting in price increases.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with the gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'should monitor its foreign employees'.
The Ministry of Health should improve controls on its extra-Community employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, the Monitoring Committee said.
The general auditor-general's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Mr. Black further expressed his concern that the Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of seafarers to be employed.
Its report has also been submitted in the same way as other decision-making controls, which have been correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor-General carried out checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Adullah, 28 years old, an Iraqi original doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after working with his jeep in the gates of the main terminal.
He was part of three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and working permits for the United Kingdom.
While the Department of Ecossai Health uses the Ecosasis Disclosure to carry out criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the General Auditor-General's report now states that the committees are now obliged to deal with the Office of Criminal Control, thus allowing employers to take control of various countries.
“Although we have discovered that some information about staff has been well verified, this has not always been done.” the report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Department of Ecosasian Health had carried out most of the pre-employment checks, but he also added: "Our report sets out aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on some members of the overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Ecosse, said that it was "very unlikely" that employment controls could identify potential employees of future terrorist acts.
He stated that "the report suggests that the current employment controls function well in the health system and that these warnings are not certain that they can bring any added value."
The health authorities declared that 1161 people from overseas were employed, consisting of most doctors and nurses.
However, the Director-General pointed out that these figures must certainly be reimbursed, partly because of problems with the identification of members of the staff of a fixed-term contract, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures for health control of health authorities in Ayrshire and Aran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are all appropriate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its policy and pre-employment control system for staff members other than the Ocean of Health Service.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon stated: "I was eager to carry out this work following the terrorist attack at the airport of Glasgow."
It added that the Government of Scotland attached to health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure a better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, which are valid for all employees, including those of others.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio pic on the last singer of Joy Division, Ian Kurts, highlighted 5 prizes, including the best film, to the Oscars of the British Independent Film.
The trophies were also attributed to Sam Riley's star, who worked in a store until he was engaged in the role of Curtis in this film, where the stager was Anton Corbín and the co-star Toby Kebell.
Mrs. Judi Dench was appointed the best actor for her role in the "Notes on a scandal"
Daniel Craig, the star Bond got the price Variety to allow the British film to be under international thinkers.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 devastating results
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that 208 soldiers involved in organizational cells had been arrested in an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks against the Ecclesiasticals and Armed Forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter stated that one of the missile counter-attack cells.
Al Qaeda's sympathies have staged a campaign against the monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell composed of eight soldiers, led by a foreign resident planning an attack on a oil site in the Oriental Province, declared TV.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a 35,000 military group to protect sites following an attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
Citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior, the newspaper stated that 18 persons arrested belong to a cell led by a “mission-launching expert” who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militarists planned the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the prisoners would appear to have committed the murder of ecclesiatics and armed forces.
The Government asked the ecclesiatics to do more against Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda's soldiers in combating Allied Forces and the Muslim Shiite Government associated with the United States, considered to be a hierarchical according to the tough line of Saudis Sunny.
Al Qaeda's militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many churchists collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The militants, encouraged by the appeals against the Western Saudi Government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government property and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces in the last five months" declared the Minister of the Interior's speech on state television.
Among the prisoners, 16 members of the Media are organized in a "mediatic cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against unbelieving and apostate Muslims.
Of the prisoners, 32 were accused of subsidizing the military.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a beautiful planet to live.
The data from the European orbital vessel have shown that the planet is probably two times smaller than the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought of.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that thousands of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and it could even have been inhabited.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation associated with a slower rotation led Venus to any other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is free of water, is flooded with hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a temperature surface that is hot enough to melt the cloud.
The discovery of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's probe that studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to the catastrophic climate change.
The professor of physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand the reason why Venus's climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planet itself is similar.
"Our new data enables us to establish a scenario where thousands of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, it could be even with a living surface."
From the rich uranium secreted by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently of uranium, was stolen by the Czech and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons had been arrested and that the material was currently analysed.
It did not confirm that it was a good uranium, but it revealed that the market would have a value of $1 million (£480.000).
Still open to everything
Mit Romney declared not to be high as a presidential candidate, to answer the questions of a good snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidates to the presidency finally agreed to participate in the discussion of You Tube, during which many ordinary voters recorded their questions, subject them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, November 28th, none of the questions raised were as ridiculous as that resulting from another discussion of You Tube, when a good-neighboured man asked the Democrats their position regarding the recovery of the planet.
This time, however, questions and answers have reflected much about the conditions of the Republican party, which were applied to the next elections.
We do not know what criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show the candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard interesting things: The region raised approval doors when the candidates expressed themselves in a large way.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was among Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is head of the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to set aside the fact that he was comfortable with the clandestine immigration during his mother's term of office in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, to employ clandestine immigrants at his home.
The two combatants became particularly happy when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote an "Amnesia" (providing the prisoners a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have succeeded in deepening this issue.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have started fighting immigration before and in a more intensive way than others.
In general, the candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same opinions: stricter boundaries, and zero tolerance for foreigners.
This, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the issue of toxic games manufactured in China, or other fear of the outside world, encourages the Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly confusing when other issues have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether to put water into the nose should be considered a torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety, in the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about belief in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another participant asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in a position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - to declare that the pain of death is painful as much as necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he smiled and said that Jesus was too young to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains uniquely open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's reconstruction in Iowa coincides with the recent progressive research of grants conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the syllables during the Wednesday debate.
These two are born out there, because the two sides of the party are not able to agree on who is the most known and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unifys the part of good time and convincingly thanks to a message of success on the Americas that so approached the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sleep; even if he was released, the situation would not change.
In view of the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly juridical.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices of politicians, no extra double foot cut.
But this is what a revelation expects that a rich man would have been masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £550,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle with Gordon Brown had taken place.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister took a step back in his election project, falsely accusing British intelligence that the polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, Mr. Vince Cable, the liberal leader of democracy, said that the territary Mr. Brown had transformed from Stalin into Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's crash, a difficult bank on the crack board, showed a lack of directives and medical judgement in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of generals in retreat launched a revolution among the Lords, protesting the reduction of military expenditures: they claimed that being a minister of defence was for them, a part-time employment.
At the present time, the suspicion of false donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Workers (and his former chief of oversight) made it necessary for them to be released.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is heading immediately to the exit.
Governments can, however, reach a point where it would be impossible to rule.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually leave their doubts behind when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a prime minister cannot improve things, nor even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of the ministers are balanced; the press is searching for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because contrary to other political leaders, he cannot be a starter.
Although he would like to represent Tony Blair, he was still his superior employee.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to the decisions of Mr Brown when he was the chancellor of the British treasurer.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's damages, such a long investigation on the funds of the part "the money accountant for the members of the House of Lords", the electors might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not as tragic as it is in the air.
The gaffes are not as manifest as members of the Tories party believe it.
Like in Mr. Bean, there's no victim or scrokery.
And the rescue, although painful, could always be to establish the Stalinian tendencies of Mr Brown, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special person, comparing his contributions to charity, said that he did not want any public appreciation for his welfare.
He may have his opinion, but that's not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of major policy supporters are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was in the course of Mr. Abraham's programs, without knowing that this was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of suspicious data in October.
But so far, Mr Brown has not been involved: There is no reason to believe that he was in the course of these proceedings, even though most of the payments made were made after his arrival to the government in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of it.
He was quick to condemn the legislative failure of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making authority rests on a course he knows well, to appeal to a committee of inquiry on the subject made by a lawyer and a judge.
In this case, learning lessons are not complicated.
And if the law has been abolished, it's from the police source.
In addition, there are many other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Standards, without leadership for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would require the Working Party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Torias, which could reduce its particular financial report with the confederations; in short, a rather expensive pill for such a partner as Mr Brown.
But he should face some divisive facts.
The party of the conservators now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to reconnaissance the electors, and the only way to achieve a victory is to demonstrate an inseparable integrity and strong competence.
Scrolls of cards.
Would the mortgage crisis pollute the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see attached nagers, turn around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, the lenders are looking at the US credit card market.
The Goldman Sachs family analysts believe that losses related to credit cards could amount to $99 billion if the contamination extends hypotheses to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in rates of costs and insolvency, which measures the parts of the unrecoverable balance, or which are, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credit to the consumer, partly due to the lack of card carriers.
It's just too fast to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is less than one point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly understandable by technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 to the United States regarding the personal banknote caused a broken down of banknote archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of files (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the terms of the stamps were to be used.
The industry announces in addition to fixed payment rates, which will release the monthly rate of payment that consumers need to manage.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the parallelization of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market are certain to exist: consumers could prefer to increase their commitments now that equity real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of the heritage, and therefore the loss of real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the credibility of the investors.
They could even benefit credit issuers.
The premiums to consumers for mortgage payments fall if the property costs less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card closure would be a priority for reimbursing all.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid recovery of actions.
"We will not wake up one morning and reassess all the loans." said Gary Perlin, director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a resulting decline.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contract in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Take a good look at the dorsal nags.
The British bankers complain about the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to witness their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's former financial director, Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement, calling for complicity.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had previously declared themselves innocent of seven counts of alleged fraud committed in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial fraud in order to increase the impact of their employees.
They should present themselves to the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they were all declared guilty of committing a fraud.
The three former Greenwich NatWest branches, a PLC branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Britain for the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains a matter of suspension for this investigation, followed by the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of government investigation in the absence of Enron.
The charges against the bankers, including the "three of Natwest", were declared to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a false scenario with Fastow and his ex-branch, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in an Enron-controlled partner's office, which was the founder of many false scenarios, which helped him call banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the branch as nothing, but in fact the three British people already knew its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the branch bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest for this company.
According to the charge, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the branch.
But in fact these $20 million are gone in the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have received $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow applied for his active role in two conceptions in the debriefing of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow was sentenced to six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after payment of $1 million each, which required them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, before the seventh largest national company, in the banking sector in December 2001 after years of accounting calls, could no longer hide its billions of fines or even propose their speculatives as profitable.
The fund has generated thousands of licences, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in losses for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against the Law for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been dropped because of its death due to a heart attack last year.
You're not alone, you're out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Golfstream, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, has sufficient fuel to fly without Moscow scale in Los Angeles, part of $54 million.
But that's just a little change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats that it is more than a family use plane or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the stand of Gulfstream, last Friday, in the Millionaires Hall, for four days in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
Another Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their positions, hoping to awaken the interest of new Russians for their products, going from yachts to cars full of diamonds such as 50 cents.
Mr. Firer was looking at a brilliant orange porsche, exposed on the side of his stand.
"it's a nice car, but nothing compared to our product" he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private airport market."
"With a oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll into the black gold, such as Dallas"
"We have done the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans have become so rich and have landed in Europe where they would be considered materialists." Marshall Goldman, senior student of the Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, said.
Like the Saudis in the 70s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians emerge as the world's largest expenditures.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry enabled Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnold, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the follow-up strategy for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The Conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion worth of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the wealth are made up of 103 billion Russians, totaling $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists of the economic and financial research centre.
(The World Bank stated that 15.8 per cent of Russians lived below the poverty line in 2005.
“There are hundreds of millions in Moscow, and that is why we are all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London bijoutier.
She participated in the hall for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Bijoutier Group of Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Going to the living room, Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declared to be their clients, millions.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who wore his high-speed dress as a red taper like Joan Rivers.
The hall seems to look before looking at the new riches, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to make the hole in their mouths to come to an immense entrance where they are exposed to Cadillac Escalades, platinum canals, Mövenpick glass, personalized billboards, Dubaii apartments and Gund pools.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"the Russians are interested in defining the most expensive brands and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat happily at the Royal Poscilian porcelain manufacturing stand in Delf, before a wall table of Raimbrant on blue carriages.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, sellers have stated here that Russians holding old capitals (10 to 15 years are too old according to Russian standards) have already passed logos that are exposed to a limited edition brand that could not be sold in the living room.
Despite this, thousands of people, millions of people, and millions of people, or tourists, are losing their exposure every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the PDG of King Koil's lits, said he had sold two sets of mats in his satie, cashmere, and an incredulous cotton of gold.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycles, a company that equips cars with the latest crisis alarm systems, also announced that he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the shining orange Porsche for $170,000.
On Monday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to braskets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be incorporated with Swarovski crystals so that it resembles a wheelchair.
The fourth cost of $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants roses made of aqueous leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not drive with such pneus," said Karapetian.
It will definitely store it in its garage containing 30 or 40 vehicles already »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian stated that the term "millionaire Russian" is not on the agenda, in view of the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in kind," he said.
"there's more than you can think"
Those who are not millions can at least feel this emotion when they go to the state of Continental Alliance, a Russian family of patriarchal management.
The company has built four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with mass of counter-facing dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire hall.
Surprisingly arrested to launch billboard masses, they ask their friends to photograph their mobile phones, in the good environment of this fake wealth or to improvise a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, the whole world can feel a millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unfavourable homicide surgeon in New Jersey
It was the town of Tanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked at the live bathroom of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and noticed an ambulance that was about to stop at the gates of the White Cape Cod on the West Scott Avenue.
Then comes the police patrol.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop." Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was lost.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a management performed by an unfavourable cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they are confident that the results of the toxicological tests will take time, but that should enable this mysterious death to be resolved, which attracted the high ranks of Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well-known in several departments.
She was loyal, great work and tenacity," McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview, Wednesday. "
"she was like a pit bull"
"it would have done anything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-prison of Newark police officer working for the Committee on the Control of Alcoholic Boys, and that she left two 14- and 11-year-olds, as well as a beautiful daughter.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was killed because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It's an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities declared that they had arrived at her house at 15 p.m.
and have found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical cabinet.
Mercredi, no one opened the door of Melle Castro's house where a hungry rosier rest in the closet in front of the cemetery, and a Dalmatian refused back.
A blue biton called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for the bathroom in kitchen and for perfumes, passed in a hangar, next to a door leading to the ground.
Two cars all over the country on the coast.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping to navigate into the new city and to abandon its established political culture.
"she said "you must pay attention to this," she told him.
"She was here when I arrived, and still here when I was born.
"It was boring"
All the world hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the world's poverty rate.
The actions were expressed by two parts of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the terms of the credit, thereby reducing the rates of interest promised by the acceding statements of the Vice-President of the Central Bank.
Business markets operate in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, said those who decide should be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In a clear attempt to reassure the markets that these new credit-related tensions are being overcome, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turbulence has partly "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
In the event that this heavy turbulence had to continue, this would increase the likelihood of further rigid financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital in the US markets and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news on the American economy, such as the largest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial storm was subsequently accentuated by the Bear Stearns, investment bank, which announced that it would license 650 persons, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs of compensation for the heavy losses incurred by the Parises in the absence of real estate loans.
20 posts are only planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased from 331 points, or 255%, ending at 13.289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% ending at 6306.2 adding more than 39£ to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took by 2.3%.
In the past, the recovery of credit difficulties in the markets has been subject to a strong request for a sale of three-month funds by the European Central Bank, which has spent these loans on European trading banks at a high rate of 4.7 per cent, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to monitor the FED and the ECB and to inject further funds in the London financial markets causing credit tensions has led to three-month pressure on the British banks 'Libor', leading to their highest growth since September last, to 6.59 per cent following a strong increase since 12 November.
England faces an appeal to the trial in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be the English fighter No.6 for Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the electorate who was here exclusively to help Peter Moores, chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the Office of Hugh Morris, the President-General of England, begins to fill in the application form to become a national elector, at least in part.
The one who does not come to win the dosard n°6 will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is also wrong.
This is never easy to predict what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never reach the lowest level, sometimes by lack of chance more than by lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that the selection is difficult because eventually the judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time to wake up Bopara?
Is this right about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, choosing between John Edwards or Banerjee "tuby"? Both, new frameworks that have obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promulgated: but there is only one place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the fair level of a cricket unless at least one chance has been given to him?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also in the opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must capture the head of the captain's eye, while he must take the door and a beater must be able to touch the cricket one day.
But capturing the eyes of the electors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to have some to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison had declared himself fully and continued to be trained to serve.
Anderson took 32 first class doors on 33 towers to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 to the same average, but both have already spent their time praising at the highest level and are still looking forward to offering.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's playing in the Asgiriya Stadium, that's just an opinion issue.
This choice could either cancel or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Garreth Batty played in each test and successfully succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 useful tours, but this was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary critic of the Test, and that, despite the fact that his two hundred marked against Australia could still be appreciated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience against the disappearance of young Bopara.
The two have good arguments.
In the favor of Shah, its brilliant and considerable start at the innnings of the 88 test in Bombay, 32 percent of the first class versus six for Bopara, which is 22 years younger, and its excellent classification at launch.
But Shah did not make ten rounds during his two rounds in May against the Caribbean during the Lord's Test, his city of Middlesex player, and that, the immediate rejection by the electors when Vaughan is again in shape, claims his place for the next match, seems to have broken his steps so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is happy to live.
Nothing made him afraid of a cricket land and he exclaimed when he was recently caught on a 4x4 in a presentation by Volkswagen, Sponsor of England.
He reported only slight injuries, he was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (responsor well above) and call Alastair Cook, his remote crew, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is far from the best fighter, his charming guide allows him to do whatever he wants, and that he battles with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right moment is another.
Can it be the real art of selection?
I'd be happy to give her a chance to Bopar, which doesn't mean that Shah shouldn't apply if, like the tea leaves suggest, he'll be playing this weekend.
Buses push people to work, and fight against Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, putting these displaced without money or visa renewals, or others hoping that the city had returned to normal.
Some have returned to fight the fighters who have distanced them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 persons transported in the bus cars of twelve buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I've come back today because I've seen the TV and read it in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and I've seen that the city is more bright now."
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the Ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to stay away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwana, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Amariah area dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariah called him to inform him that the U.S. military helped him, allowed him to escape Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's new arrivals was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after urging citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to put in place an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Slekh, and they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing greed of the capital since the American troops arrived, and for the continued training of well-armed "citizen groups of citizens" and working with American soldiers to defend their vicinity.
But others say that they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline in the capital of Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have been in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion that all of them felt about visas for exile as Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have been from the country due to sectoral deaths.
"We have no problem until al-Maliki comes to Syria and urges the Government to stop visiting the Iraqis, in order to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni said.
“ I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I’m part of it. ”
The reduction of violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been evacuated from Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a Sudanese flow of refugees will no longer increase sectoral tensions and end combat.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state is professional training, and it shines even through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that on the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest fed state, by self-determination, appears for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools work closely with neighbouring countries.
The University was founded in Sarebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by a double, a triple degree.
It testifies to the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools in the middle - many of them without a university in Gymnasium.
"A Sarre, we benefit from the professional training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW training expert.
More than one in five earns their degree in a professional school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also well developed.
In view of the number of residents, the double course is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased from one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Sharrois Education has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we have held a large number of reforms in general schools.", a spokesman from the Ministry of Education said.
Thus the Government introduced comparison tests into all federal state.
In order for children to start learning more quickly, the last year of the crisis is a rule of law - a model that in times of other federal states too.
Only future comparison studies can show if students' performances improve in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the rate of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The bavarians are getting better.
And in the great spite of the sarros, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - it could be achieved in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in the Lycaes - even if the sarros are not French.
Manage Views
In Venezuela, the exhibitions will soon be more cic-tac than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will re-mount the radius of a half-hour in the South American country.
Chavez eventually becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated to him, as a result of a new law, the exhibitions will be arranged at least four hours and a half of universal time.
In this way, the South American country receives an hourly forum that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position among others because the United States would have imposed a separation of hours in full hours on the world.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, because of an act of aggression.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state or with the Government of Colombia.
"I can't do it, already only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who had a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country should vote on Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The determinant element of this debate was the decision of Uribe to withdraw from Chávez the mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "stirred to the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain also Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone sound in the country: "Why don't you call" is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, in the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant interferences of the left-wing populists and who told him to stop.
A decline in salaries threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjunctivation, according to a forecast, a real low-value wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their psychiatry.
According to the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should wait for a real reduction in their pay rate in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The failure is due to the low wage development, the increase in added value tax and the price of food and energy products," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economics and Conjunction Research, in the "Bid".
New burdens could also be involved in insurance insurance for the employee.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected decrease in insurance insurance by 3.3 per cent for the new year was certain to be correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to request the Federation of Credits or Financial Assistance, according to the SPD policy.
It was said that the price explosion of food products and hydrocarbons had increased the rate of inflation at its highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from one year to another.
Venus is the hell of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere in life, Venus is more like the Earth than we thought so far: the "Venus Express" European space probe has discovered light in the atmosphere and wind turbines to the lungs, like those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have claimed there are clarifications on Venus.
The "Venus Express" European probe has today proved - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the vetos on Venus emit about 56 kilometres of cloud clouds, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine " Nature".
According to the famous theory of the Cyprus, lighthouses would have made life on Earth appear: the clock would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the stone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was a life there, it must have been a very old date of history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be no room for living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more dense than on Earth, and there are sometimes 500 degrees of temperatures.
"You may have come to Earth's infernal jungle, but it remains a jungle," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by a very different evolution, is the key issue of the ASE mission.
The beginning of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in venous research, since no probe has been in progress for the exploration of this planet for the past four decades.
According to researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of " Nature" not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbor's planet are more numerous than those suggested at first.
So researchers have found, in addition to the wind turbines already known in the North Pole, a cloud turbine in the South Pole, which runs even faster.
The phenomenon reminds the air corridors in the earth's atmospheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni de l'Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale and Fisica Cosmica Italiane.
The second planet of the solar system is almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers, almost as large.
The highly qualified planet of the night or the morning rotates around the sun in just 225 days.
However, she slowly turns on herself: one day she spent 243 days on land.
Although Venus, with a temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not remember Earth well, scientists assume that the two planets are made in similar conditions.
On both sides, the water was accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in the space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been established on Earth in the form of carbon, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's encounter with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Köhler, calls for the end of the party's request for Dalaii Lama's home to Chancellery.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPD for attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and is the great coalition of Closure's wish for Dalaii Lama's welcome.
"We must not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to Tradesblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for Dalai Lama's welcome by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I respect the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressing the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the challenges she would have to organize a new Chinese policy.
The German Chancellor has not taken its distance with the traditional policy of one China alone.
"China knows you too," said Köhler.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had been indirectly informed of his discontent with the Dalaii Lama's reception and had been attacked for this outside the CDU ranks.
Steinmeier was particularly concerned about the "debt policy" of the CDU in foreign policy.
After Dalaii Lama's welcome to Chancellery, violent irritations began to occur in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only decommissioned the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to Spiegel's information, also welcomed the dialogue on the strategy of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
The head of the Government of China Wen Jiabao now requires German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the invitation to Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that the European political men receive Tibetan spiritual leader in his official functions, thus supporting the Chinese position Wen Jiabao.
The words and deeds of Dalai Lama would show that he was trying to separate from China the Tibetan and other Tibetan regions, including other modern provinces.
Schäuble guard against the evictions like those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble keeps on guard against evictions such as those in France.
All must be implemented so that social satisfaction in Germany does not spread in the streets by violence, the Minister of the German Interior has demanded.
Barriers that burn, police casserators and casseroles: after the heavy evictions of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must make sure that a social explosion does not belong to us as well and disappears in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
All young individuals would not be able to go out with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the Communities had already worked hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"The summits of integration to the Islamic Conferences, which has already shown its first success."
But it would be too early for an end to alert.
Schäuble notes at the same time that in the German banners, there are no sociological problems or the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisan agglomerations, young people were delivered to serious street battles with the police during the last few nights.
In Toulouse too, public cars and buildings burned.
This is what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for.
Taking into account the effects in France, Kolat was careful against the "imposition effects".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as it is in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat highlights the fact that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age is higher than the average.
There should be more places for training first.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Communities, however, added that social control in families had more place in Germany than in France.
Many young people over immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must always be careful."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
While waiting, in the Parish faucour of Villaers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter crossed the area with projectors.
The authorities in the position made three arrests, as well as some cars and people burned.
Since the conference, approximately 1,000 security forces have been deployed to ensure peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced by the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to Fauburg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in the eves in Villaries-le-Bel.
The next night, the trouble broke out in Toulouse.
The evictions appeared after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Park, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopic entry of the Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the background - and that there is nothing to wait for.
In what country does this channel of justice exist?
After his discouraging intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was catholic and poor, he must say: not here - not in the country which, in the end, should be ruled by it.
The debate on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel by a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said and just showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it has made it visible to everyone at what point this speech was right.
There was no specific interest or good sense for the country's problems to be felt.
In place, Angela is presenting as a cloud: an intruder politician, who was in foreign policy and who is even staying in the closet.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even, self-esteem - having been so modest, the head of the CDU would have rejected it two years ago.
It now breaks into formulas all the facts, that growth would affect people.
There she destroyed her picture of pragmatist, who solved the problems instead of emblazoned the world.
But in the end of Angela's cloud, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and underpaid workers' concerns?
He's got a few words left for that.
In this regard, it reveals the number of times that she makes seizures when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three steps to deliver a clear half sentence.
She's been in an unknown place since it became a concrete one.
The Attack Branch
In the discussion of Youtube of Republican candidates to the presidential board, the two favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a heavy offensive battle - and now they need to fear an outside candidate.
The pressure of candidates is already increasing on the first subject.
He would've made New York a "refuge for the clandestines," Mit Romney spoke to his opponent, Rudy Giuliani.
He spoke against it by loud complaints: "I would say that his own home was a haven for clandestines" answered Giulani and called on the former governor of Massachusetts to have employed immigrants without paper.
The candidates are against the attack: as the Republican base does not have any formal favor, eight candidates to the presidential office serve discussions on CNN, first of all, in order to expose their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users have sent via YouTube are more painful than the suffering.
"It's with this sort of isolationism that we let Hitler come into power," John McCain launched his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also actively teaching by Vietnam's Veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where the bride is simulated.
However, the importance of the campaign's themes for the period beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is seen in the reactions of St. Petersburg's common room in Florida.
Whether the conservation values are praised or future tax increases are rejected, the appeals vary in the audience.
That's where there's another time where there's the weaknesses of the two favorites.
"I made a mistake at this time," Romney explained, and he apologized to the base and to the public on television to have been still a party to the arrest in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes into a deep sleep when asked for his opinion on the literary interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as leader of the army, the man of Pakistani power Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination ends.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony directly to the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
Mercredi had handed over his army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and was thus subject to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a pupsch without blood flow, the former general now reigns for the first time as the head of the civil state.
With this withdrawal from the position of commander of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency situation that Musharraf had described on 3 November.
Not long after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and this will meet another Western requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which was occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with the lawyers of its ranks, rejected all appeals against the re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the tribal region of northern Waziristan in an attack against a military traffic, and four others injured.
According to the military spokesman's instructions, a bomb exploded in a street near Afghanistan's border.
Krautrock's fathers are coming back.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1960s react: the three members of the Harmonia group have re-enacted their consoles in a concert in Berlin.
For their return there are records of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at this time, they were better known abroad.
The expected sensation is then produced in the form of three monthly announcements at the evening show.
Each has his little bottle in front of him, his cable and before all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63 years of age, turns the environment into a white snowy street.
He is placed on the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old young man with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire audience, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, runs on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is accompanied by inadvertence to a piece of traditional music.
That doesn't seem to be too much for mermaids themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group replayed some of Krautrock's amateurs made sure.
We have the right to release it here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name is justified in the pop's collective memory, but in no way lastingly so that this group has been in pain for 32 years.
But why wouldn't Germany also have the right to celebrate its live legends in the 1960s?
Much more than what is commonly called "Krautrock" has become more and more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry deduced Echo's prize to the survivors of the Colonne Can group for their work in 2003, the German pop interviewers were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegrik era, the surprise was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother sat on the scene of Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in the home and the transformation in the unknown is the only and only.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio has only existed for two years and that during this period, the impact power felt was much less than what was then attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Rodelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We play first in the coffees below the Berlinian scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had deliberately relied on Kraftwerk and had finally made a name as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the musicmakers of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient firm of Weser, a 16th - century ruin, they lived as members of communities that fled the city.
Ideologically less than in the community "Common I", where Roedelius had the right to turn himself into a nurse.
It's rather an artistic existence like Spitzeg.
There was a fan of the Coral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for the art.
A lot of late Harmonia is far away from it.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia", followed by "De Luxe".
Because also serene and modician that sounded music, the group suffered material misery.
The harvest of the dead wood was not for him alone in his search for himself.
The "Live 1974" CD that appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a public record of almost 50 heads, as well as some thought to be remembered.
Rother was released at the time, and he wanted to force Harmonia to be trained in time.
It was a moral requirement for Rodelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother atterritt in the spheres of esotericism and ensures its existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (Flammage Hearts).
Cluster is re-initiated in the twenty-fourths and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We need the live album of Griessem in Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Greenland has set the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
No! It had already been destroyed on this occasion as Roedelius's personal work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia took place at the World's Cultural House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized in the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, British, old punk and author of the booklet "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the overall flow margin of Krautrock's influence would be checked for future pop music.
The space left by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase in the room in the middle of his solos: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm area.
The projections of other photos in black and white cabled tools in basar serve to train the legend.
First, the three veterans are again busy in improvising.
But more by collecting microphones at the top and at the battery, to extract the instruments of the innovated sound through the instruments of self-constructed effects.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in big technical finers.
At the same time, there's nothing to change about the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we were showered and we were waving under the cloud of sound, and we sang at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with an emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He's never been a rock.
The races were less searched in the blue than in the music conservators (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the output of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls "68" has not been entirely wrong, and Harmonia is also not going to let himself become more irritant by this moment.
But what goes most of it will be covered in minutes on the scene.
Where's the music going and where's it going?
It can fall on the nerves of someone (?) or give away moments of great joy.
Richard Gere isn't just a cynic.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace of Death", two films re-examine the war of the Balkans.
But they both don't agree.
Both projects are too much on the action and on the exchange of unintended shots or they are too alarming.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: some Karadzic and Mladic war criminals are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is just there, in the backmost country of Bosnia's most violent war, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the fourties of the 20th century, because too many nice and fun roles in women's feelings movies and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have made him want to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at when even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the chasser ( why today's films must be as long and confusing as collective conventions of locomotic drivers?)
He gives a wonderful full representation of eyes: in the background, his reputation as a war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the design and industry of the films were not so beautiful: a man who has his best moments since behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins at his descent, has preserved visible remains of his former charm.
Despite this, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production of "Death peace", which also emerged this week, the endless follow-up of films that have been filmed in the Balkans war.
"Death peace" can be done quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovo's French tyrants, in which one of the two is still in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs here are not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film is as wide as a movie loses too quickly in the action and insensible shooting trades.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a car but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can consider the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", because there has never been a real film on the Balkans war.
The history of the three American war reporters, who are in a position to beat the high criminal war "the regard", could have become, with another realist and another scenariosist (both Richard Shepard) at another time, a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look like a bit of a shock: two men go to a small team in the forest to do something that the soldiers can't do, and for the two men, that becomes a trip in the mud.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we don't just let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynique with a heart, as we were presented at the beginning.
No, the script must be attributed to a romantic adventure with a Bosniak then murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad when, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, NATO, the CIA and all the world's prize hunters have failed in five years: to capture the war criminal and leave it for a fair advantage in the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of Justice of the Hague should be prosecuted against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has a deep human concern.
He wants to deny that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (this must be an exclusive agreement) that they do not drive the chaos in an intensive manner due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intended and evil is this time so similar that a famous poem from Brecht comes to our mind.
He speaks of a mask in the wood of an Asian demon on the table of work of the poet: "Compatising, I see the faces of the glamorous front, clearly: how it makes it difficult to be wrong."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such darkheads, but those who ignore what it's hard to be good.
The problem is not limited to the sort of movies on the Balkans war.
Recently, it has been reported in this journal that all Hollywood films on Iraq were large flups.
We can add: there have never been good films on South Africa yet.
What is worth every time: when a star walks on a field of crisis or mine, it turns out to be something like "Rangon" with Patricia Arkette, "Jesseits goler Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are just too close in time.
Whatever it is, decades have always passed before Hollywood can turn a good movie on the holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films have yet to be painted - those who today have classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated simultaneously at their time as heads of work.
But perhaps we know today too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatombe comes directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this angers scanners the lack of sculptures they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Be or not" or "The dictator" have actually become so good because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not know what point the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe he doesn't want to be good when we want to make good films.
Perhaps there is a need to have the sarcastic artistic view and distance from Romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historic novel "Dictor of Lemprière" and the war of the Balkans, he replied, "It does not matter that some things never change."
"The big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be killed in a horrible way and war will always be in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust gathers the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The reception of the mayor with Hamburg's candidate for the Summer Olympics has been successful in politics and the economy at critical vulnerabilities.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games on the waterboard.
But Von Beaust calls for realism in appreciation of the chances.
The principal director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a decline as "mousvais for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting elite could not be maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to interrupt the project, but to find a more long-term starting point, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
The Mayor Ole von Beaust remained a believer in his previous statements, which stated that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until the year 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympics," said Von Beust at WELT Online.
It refers to the decision expected of the Sports Federation in early December on Munich's application for winter games in 2018.
This preference means for us, that, in the time-limits that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beaust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
The impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to stop an opportunity, covering the projects now," said HSB President Günter Ploß.
A drop in the application would be further contrary to the statements made by the Head of the Senate at the time of the plenary meeting of the German Federation of higher schools of sport.
On the other hand, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's application to the 2015 universities as "no substitute" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport was first appointed in the last weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD department of the mayor urged the Senate not to use this precious time in the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it has played the map of the Olympics and has excluded the construction of dwellings," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Small Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympics candidate would have a great enthusiasm for it in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' helmets.
The one who connects Swedish concepts and falls into wood, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At this time, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on the Warhol work list.
A large part of the twenty-five Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are contradictions.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the British Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museum of Stockholm today leads to a dissertation result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave a gift in 1995 to the Moderna Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm", which are traveling on the international art market.
The ancient story is covered, a convincing presentation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created its first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, which is based on the red-white-white design of the "Brillo" soap cardboard.
A exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet was presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - of hundreds of Brillo cartons made of cartons: They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartonage Factory.
It was not about works of art here, but rather about their models, examples of exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wood boxes in Sweden, which were not yet exposed to Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the day are now talking about about about about 15 forests that would then be legalized in the history of art and castles, as the original Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached over $100,000 in sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum claimed, in fact, that, later, about a hundred forest caches had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had subsequently issued.
In fact, 105 Hulten cases were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
On that day, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator of Moderna Museet, examined three other Swedish private collections, including two of them in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and painted, then applied with a paint brush in white oil.
The text of copies dating from 1990 reveals that the painting was directly applied without background on the stratified panels, using a painting roll - it is no longer a oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These cases have not been authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York has no further decision, the Moderna Museet will class the six cases in its collection as copies/explosive material."
Already in July, the Board has heard a great announcement that it would investigate the "hard charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap cassettes.
But since we've been down there with an inexorable silence.
The rebels of Manille abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers leave, the same ones who have been deported to a hotel in Manila, and who have demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who complained to the President about corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer any blood flow.
The faithful soldiers in power had not before taken over the hotel with the help of lacymogene gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been escorted from the building for hours.
About half of them were held guilty before the courts because of a lack of pussch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillans.
It uses the audience to skim over with about 30 sympathetics.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, appeared to have been deserted in favor of him and joined in his mammothry.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and requested President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's withdrawal.
The government's loyal troops are closing the sector around the hotel.
The President held an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the action of soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who ruled before the Scouts Rangers elite unit, said that other units of the army wanted to join the march shortly.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a great demonstration against the President Wednesday.
Its government has been surrounded for months by threats of corruption.
The Manille's finance district has been the theater of some 200 members of the Army's army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection breaks almost 24 hours after the army refuses to join it.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts of pusch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the main shareholders of Versatel.
The United Internet has provided more than 20 per cent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price by action is EUR 14,46, as the company communicated to Mercredi.
Only 20.05 per cent of the social capital would be held.
We've already been spying on a rocket before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
This is not an attempt to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has been communicated.
As a matter of fact, assumptions had already been made as regards an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would only hold money for a third party, which is on the market.
The guard, the United Internet had already acquired a 10 percent share in Drillisch mobile phone company.
In the context of a capital increase, Drillisch placed in Bourse 17.4 million new actions of a value of EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies founded the participating MSP company to absorb Freenet’s competitor.
At the moment, the two companies wanted to appreciate their participation of 10 percent in Freenet, and do not use their right to lower 18,49 percent additional in Freenet, trusted the United Internet Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all open options, especially increasing participation in SA Freenet, have been learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The poker is still difficult to predict on Freenet which has been a part of the strengthening of the German telecoms market for months.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers connected with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillish Holding has so far held a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillish would bring about four hundred additional.
The right to purchase 18,49 per cent of Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
