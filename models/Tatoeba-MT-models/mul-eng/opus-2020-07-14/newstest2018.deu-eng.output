Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view on the city
An Irreen agency where young people are supposed to meet today.
A puzzle game where you can now dig for the S-road tunnel.
Small-scale holdings are the only reason for farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.
It's nervous if maps are not present.
This is known by anyone who has ever had to stand up because the auto-navi showed a green way instead of a surrounding street.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the state government's geoportal Bayern, are all different than current - but that is why it is very obvious.
Especially when compared with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and communities in the area of the Merkur have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flash drive that is not recognized as such.
In the large overview maps, detailed maps, such as representation sheets, were made for cities and communities.
These occurred according to the Bayerische Vermessungsungsungsungsung between 1810 and 1864 and resulted in the first Bayern Vermestungstungsung.
Your commander, Napoleon.
The French leadership occupied Bayern since the early 1800s during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops, with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, finally withdrew: there were today’s neighbours who created the idea of a floating Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued to run the project, founded the Topographic Bureau - and thus the Bayern Board of Defense.
The Urposition Sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the page of the Bayer Country Library.
The comparison of the former/Today is the most impressive of the country's capital, for example.
The city has expanded in all directions and is united.
An example of this is a transmitter that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sentling was joined 21 years after the map was created, so 1877, as Munich City Hall.
Today is a delivery in the middle of the city.
In 1856, the houses of the subsendlings focus on today's plinganser street, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the resistance of the Baeric farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, nothing is seen as fields - at first glance: In the Chinese zoom, a smaller map appears with thousands of lines and numbers: hand-numbered pieces from the so-called "recovery", from which the basic tax was removed.
There are small parcels there today no more farmers - but small operators of the "Land in Sun".
A large green area is drawn north of the transmitter.
The Theresienvise, since 1810 the October festival, was actually a visa and no concrete wall in the 19th century.
On the other hand, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpossblatt, in the area of today's Au-Hyhausen, you read not only the street name "Am Gasteig" or from the addition "On the Air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the airfield street, one stopped people from getting their ideas.
There, in 1858/59, the Münchner Creis-Irenancet was created "On the Air Air"
In 1872 Dr. Bernhard of God led the establishment of the Psychiatrist, who was brought into contact with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was making progress for his time and ended, for example, the polling of the so-called irons.
In addition, he ordered the staff to use violence against the insatises," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Hayhaussen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the agency.
For 280 patients, there was first room, then 500 seats were extended.
In any event, this capacity was no longer achieved - the reason for the construction of the cruiser's facility in Haar 1905.
There has been the Isir-Amper-Clinikkum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the construction complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
In the west lies the football square of the München East, east of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in an architectural loan to the original construction of the Irenanstalt, which was destroyed in the Second World War by bombings.
The Marienplatz was named after "Mauptplatz" in 1856, the Kaufinger street called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought decisive changes to the hearts of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city.
A big one stayed up to this day at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a groft hat from the Middle Ages were first located at the Marienhof, where the proceedings took place this day and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S Train Station.
The old Munich map can be compared to the plane from today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Group of Citizens' Rights published travel warning for Missouri
The National Union for the Promotion of Coloring has issued a warning for colorful people who travel to Missouri because of their discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which is to take effect until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention to travel through the state and to take the utmost care, since a number of cases of fraud, racially-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the country and will be noted here," the group said.
A recently adopted Misouri law, which makes it difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the criminal authorities of the country, who aim irresponsibly to minorities, ordered the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of citizens' rights that people pass.
They will be held for their skin color, they will be joined or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard."
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist prejudices against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline on his journey and was taken seriously by the police of Missouri without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Government of Missouri showing that black car drivers in the state are treated 75% more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people be conscious and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring money or let relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri reported 100 Hassfractions in 2015 following the latest figures from the FBI's Hassfraction Report programme, which established the State with regard to the number of such injuries at the 16th level of the country.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri policy that would make it harder to blame a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Before the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws, the local criminal authorities were obliged to arrest people because of immigration losses, which would contribute to further racial profiling under the ACLU.
Travel warnings are normally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent years interest groups have used the measures as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
The extension project is elemental
The Weidezaun fishing project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU members Peter White and Cordula Kovac have taken a picture in front of the site.
At the Schwendemann Family Court of Justice, representatives of the Fisherback CDU Orts Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Swendemann initially provided insights into his business, in which he managed 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 milk cows and also many young animals and hosted in five apartments holiday guests.
The Black Zald milk is the alternative market path for the milk of his kitchen, such as Swendemann.
The holiday guest table is exclusively regional.
Since he is also the president of the BLHV by Fischerbach, he referred to the project as "elevating element".
I can't bring economic benefits to such a large area.
The Greenland area is concerned about much work, many need to be processed with the engine sensor.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and topography," Swendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed these without chemical plant protection and denger, even if he did not lead to bio-use.
For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the leadership development".
For the costs of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers must be supported.
It is hoped that this could take a whole way out of the area's expansion.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to carry on their work," the mayor stressed.
The farmers are often in crisis because of the promotion
A total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were joined in 2013.
The area of opening shall be 40 hectares, which shall not be raised by at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71,500, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter of the Community took the Fischerbach.
As a result, the farmers remained EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the teeth," said Swendemann.
Cordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a good job without farmers and rural women."
Peter White also said: "It's the best food produced."
The Baden-Württemberg Agriculture Directive (LPR) allows state aid to be granted to be granted.
The target is the opening of the black hole.
The condition is the existence of a promotional clause named by the LPR.
In addition, the unifying area must not be economically viable (depending more than 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the rise.
For the Weidezaun project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 pairs, which want to build at least 16 kilometres of Zaun.
The area of opening corresponds to 35 hectares, which are calculated costs of more than EUR 112,000.
Isn't anything more holy?
Now the white house of Trump takes the stand for freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the stats.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - so the careful focused Sturz Saddam Husseins on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic act in a modern struggle with Jim Acosta from CNN on the president's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration with freedom status.
To stay fair, Miller doesn't catch the status itself.
A host of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.
But he took into account their significance, and in particular the importance that she was written when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Memorial, was added to her base.
As Miller Acosta said: "I don't want to get in here on a whole thing about history, but the stand of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world.
The idea that you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original freedom status."
Miller's actually right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of the words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your mothers, your arms, / your heavy masses, who then see themselves, are free to take away, / the last loss of your rich coast."
There was never a time to see the "complete waste" on our screen.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statute is part of a broader political and cultural change: in fact, it is a conflict about the significance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the ground - knew very well that they were doing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by portraying the female abuse of freedom in a classic visual expression.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her mind the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she owns another name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cup and a glorious attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the status, people wanted to change this from the right flight for a long time.
The great scream of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the Tüofer for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the state of freedom does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.
It will bring the burden of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The falcon should not make the way out in the United States."
It's very unusual that Limbaugh here was shot at something.
The importance of the status is quite a question of the point of reference.
The great fantastic fact of Lazarus was to see them as they were removed from the created, but hopeful people after a long and often terrible journey on the decks of ships.
It goes in the real sense to see the world from the perspective of people looking for guidance and a chance to improve their lives.
Your status tells them the words of hope and of the welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to admit.
Their weakness should not make the way clear, but the Hass, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Elidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shots were on the British team
The Executive Director of the United Kingdom Leichtatelliques, Neil Black, says that the 16-pound Scottish continent in the World Championships will "a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which started on Friday.
Black believes that "there has been some special development in Scotland" and that the UK's literature needs to learn something about it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Lichtateletik: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medallents, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will be represented against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000th Street, while Elidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.
"Eidh is pretty bad.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, left the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The patience and the real feeling that Elid's naturally touched were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will be present at its fifth world championships at the 400m-hours, says it's "unbelievable" that 16 shots are in the British army.
Scotland has so far been the best number of athletes at the World Championship, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.
The midway route will lead to this path and has established five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m run.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot that should be observed after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trial and the Anuniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world champions when the only other shot in the team Lee McConnell was.
The man-capitalist says that she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her people are not only part of the team, but also in some cases also in the media and in the finals.
"The fact that she was elected by the other members of the team is that it was also a great honor, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added.
"I am obviously very proud of all the shoes belonging to the team.
It's just showing how far we've come.
And they're here as stable athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
What do I say about the captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home-world heritage.
So it is really important to put on this home-aid and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Block critics on Facebook: Don't get you into a public office if you can't afford the membership of voters
Our country's father knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from internal policy to his political principles.
He worked at the criticism, I'm sure.
But he didn't bring his critics to the shore.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we will be led as the sheep to the slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it, to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this week's beginning.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as voluntary, and the online comment was filled with an opposite reaction with "Yes, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a kind of Hogan.
This is a republican governor in a vast democratic state that is extremely popular.
He has the highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionive hit head.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his country and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blockade of persons who come to the governor’s side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public taxes - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chase defended the government's actions and argued that blocking the comments would be no more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hair-filled people who push the pets online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur, and a pharaoh, no trolley.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic beliefs.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with hair, but she asked for Hass's crime.
"I commented respectfully that I was surprised that there was no response to Hasscene and other current messages," she wrote in the comment area of the message "The Post".
"I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they will be abused by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the Governor's staff referred to as "concentrated spam attack" would probably refer to others as "Purchase".
The Facebook era makes it easy to shorten a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you had done the same, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance articles and to burn or arrest demonstrators and bring them to the shore.
But that's exactly what's going on digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for creating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.
The board of supervisors of the Loudoun County suffered the first amendment, according to U.S. District Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she joined a selection of her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington time, the time of the convenient port had a similar effect like the Internet.
The number of newspapers increased from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers ran to his lead.
And even at the time, Washington had anonymous trolle.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belsarius" and "Portius", write all letters to newspapers that lower Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Great Britain, reinforced his office, according to the historical documents collected by George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't bring her to the shore.
Freedom of speech, differences of opinion and discourses are based on our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty is expected to be at home in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is holding the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordier, who led the Archerfield Links to the end of last year, before losing Paul Eales, is connected to the new Austrian place and serves as a tournament messenger on behalf of the Union Founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his dream with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he found this place.
He is a freer host of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The English Eales is pleased to defend a mastership for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories come back from the last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we'll always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to home.
This event will be its first Scottish event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helsinki.
"You want to do it well, but you also smell this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I have played a solid golf.
I'm glad it's been so far."
With the trio on the field, the former master winner Ian Woosnam and the senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance belong to the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a car and £ 10 per car with two or more cars.

Less lung cancer due to passenger demand
In the past two decades, fewer people have been killed because of passenger accidents on lung cancer.
To this end, scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg-Eppenddorf (UKE) come to a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are to be returned to passports per year," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he conducted his own study on this subject in 1994.
At the time, 400 cases of lung cancer have been reported in Germany due to yearly passenger accidents.
The new survey is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home links show themselves as very complex
The construction works in the Villallinger Street are in full range and are "lying at least in time", according to the director of the building's Fred Heinze.
In the area of household locks, the situation is more complicated than it is, as the background is much hidden, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic that keeps the construction work back on is a big problem for the company's construction call.
"The ignorance of the car driver in front of the red bells and detonators is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road was closed and only the line buses were allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp's company have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already very exciting.
But fortunately, we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei bought dinner, she doesn't use a hair.
She's using only a very rare top.
In her wooden house in Enorotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the heartless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually refers to a sweet potatoes - local as "nota" - directly in the truck.
After a half hour, the frozen bone will be removed and crushed with soft, unwashed hands.
He sits on the floor floor - she has no furniture - where she does her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with dry water from the nearby soup.
An egg in a dark room serves as a latrine.
When the four wives of her husband were younger, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, later work can be dangerous: Most villagers are unemployed, and many drinks are hard, and there are soldiers here.
"There's no time to go back to the village after 17 hours," she says.
It is a rare view of daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was adopted after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 older people should vote for a public address before the employment strike.
An existing movement aimed at the independence of the Dutch government quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, where the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island.
Enorotali is as low as it is. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the province capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then an morning 5-hour car ride with the car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bambosans, and of well-dressed roofs converted by rose into various yellow-brown lakes.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, poor journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans condemned a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this dress," says Degei, pointing to her vivid, handy turban, her dark sky and her bright rock.
"In the past, we only had leaves in our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's worst province, where 28% of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport alone built $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has a value of 78 billion US dollars worth of wood resources.
However, these richmen are a source of land for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a remarkable presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars for local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 for a single officer.
Papuanic demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden genes and will be treated without delay.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
In the 1970s, mass killings in Papuas Tribeshochland were carried out in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission for People's Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We are losing everything" means in a 2016 report of the Erzdiösse Brisbane, which contains the report on previous year's gross amounts, such as illegal developments and floods - rape and electro-related attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims, as events happen every week," says Andreas Harrison, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The holes have been strengthened as Papuas resources brought a stream of sitters from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants come from the large-scale islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian ware canteens sell frozen honey and Gado-gado, served with mixed vegetables with earthnussauce.
Local people fight to stay here.
"Migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai-Uniheimist who went to work in the province capital of Jayapura.
"It cost the domestic Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and violations of law in Papua.
The former roomman secures 27 of all 29 areas of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, there has been little change, and today the natives feel involved.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will meet our expectations that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, Paniai is only two months after Jokowi's arrival in October a deep point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out and singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enirotali, as two Indonesian soldiers carried on a motorcycle through darkness.
The missing children told them they were supposed to turn on their scanners.
One of the soldiers took anstos at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, so did local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk were hunting and killing the group with their guns, saying victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers set fire to the group of the children.
A 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearest government commission was set up in the fire and the next day the things went uncalibrated.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and the military command center to ask for justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting clubs and led the Waita dance - running in the circle and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago.
Some demonstrators began to slam stones at police and military posts.
When the vote was suspended, the soldiers were sent an order over an internal function: "If the masses are more than three times opposed, they shoot them to," it is said in an official document by TIME that the local media were not released.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto-Viertal of Enirotali, saw the tremendous danger and called for peace and asked the many to return home.
No one had to listen to the vote.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left armpit," he said Time on his front porch of the Veranda.
Kayama still doesn't know who burned it, but she says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was filled, many holes were burned," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who was witness to the stories.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a sad mood.
"I saw that he was... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people try to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings arrived only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Jokowi, in Jayapura for three weeks, held a memorial talk in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and found it difficult to go to the historical mission in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had established an exceptional mechanism for dealing with historical human rights violations.
But the reasons began almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have an obligation to take these losses, but there are processes that must be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all will be regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who charged the UN for "Criminals against humanity", who called for more than 1,000 deaths in Osttimor's bloodless independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been committed, including the Paniai incident.
Family members of the Paniai victims took such allegations out of great disbelief.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there were no progress," says John.
"I'm smart."
He says he's still in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he said.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was shot by the military after he had been killed, to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooters didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at village residents in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between the villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man into the hospital, a person and 17 others were tortured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Doww, who was drunk when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Adjoined villagers protested in front of the company's local office.
The police said that the village's walls were being burned by officers who reacted to it by burning alarms.
But natives say that the mobile Brigade (Indonian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so in panic, we are afraid it will be given," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lived near the hospital and was a witness as the victims were quickly brought in here, the time.
"I hid two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the removal of the officers involved and for the removal of the police's mobile Brigadiers from the area.
Paniai was always an infamous for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the relatives of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many close to the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to defend the rights of the Papua by opposing the sponsors' attacks and expulsions from Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In recent years, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and voluntarily taken into custody, under the pretext of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some never get up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens the dissatisfiedness.
The small trip that is sold in Enorotali is too expensive for domestics.
Brot is exactly outside the range.
People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaves.
The agricultural sector is the task of women who are able to process four or five fields of South Cardboard each.
They maintain the majority of the income for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rubies (75 cents).
Over the course of time, economic inequalities have increased between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants, who have come to the airport of Nabire since the opening of new airports.
The few jobs available in the region are usually available to the best trained and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills necessary to manage its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai Family Council.
Insulation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain persistent.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with associated institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report to the most unsuspecting provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of pressure controls means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "dissolved and widespread damages" in Papua, including the Paniai Sheikh.
The same countries have seen historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Armanatha Nasir, showed the group's priorities back and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to translate the evidence for human rights."
People everywhere want more foreign governments to know this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited her village on May 4, the locals carried her away and forced her "We want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to attend the meeting, but remained anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that it is probably not going to vote for Jokovi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai committees," says Gobai, president of the Family Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the constant threat of a ruberian military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, considered their voice to Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite pressure and harassment, Paniai-Schussopfer's families produced a last symbolic act of the Trotz: the body of a victim was buried on a land exactly against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never be brought to justice, but at least they will not let the responsible ones forget their sins.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a broken head.
"What else can we do?"
Fires capture the 'torch' clouds of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, in one of the world's highest dwellings in Dubai, a fire found its way through its library and forced hundreds of residents from 337 metres high to fly 79 buildings.
It is the second brand, which in just two years goes through the building, which is sometimes called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept, and we stood up at the fire alarm and the screams of the people.
We ran the stairs down, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor," said a resident who called his name George Reuters.
Dubais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. (00.00 GMT) fired the fire and shut down the building.
The Government said it was working on providing grants for the victims.
The event can raise questions about the safety of materials used in outer areas of houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage to clothing, outer clothing for decoration or insulation came.
In Britain, the police said that they believed that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Greenfall Tower could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis-Cup-Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) met with his great Davis Cup Cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup only on two winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
However, the five highly valued five-six-classicers are often very long, but therefore the traditional competition is still to be achieved.
63.54% of the Member States agreed on the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was soon forgotten.
"We respect this decision, but we are surprised that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of this iconic and historical competition," Haggerty said.
It will continue to work to improve the competition.
In addition to the vote, a number of questions have already been raised before the proposal to issue the final at a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively small details: So the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in matters of training, etc. will be eased and players will have to complete less official media terms before Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 US passengers brings banned items into the aircraft, finds a question out
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 per cent of the prohibited substances at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration were moved over, including at least 6 per cent of those affected by the aircraft while carrying potentially prohibited mesh or other substances with dogs.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they had discovered later that they had been accidentally armed with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet Charterer service, the Stratos Jet Charterers Inc., also found that younger travelers were more likely to miss the rules.
Of the respondents who claimed that they were deliberately trying to fly with something that was prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of thousands were compared to less than 15 percent of the members of the X generation.
The most common substances that were deliberately transmitted to TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 per cent indicated that there were significant incidents with dogs with safety controls, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had brought deliberately banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said that it had asked visitors throughout the country to find out how many potentially smuggerware had been brought by airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It is not surprising that the people who were in the first smugware - knowingly or unknowingly - carried by the safety of those who were the most often flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what fluids they can take or how much they can take.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the largest number of objects under TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a long time, people who could view TSA books as smuggware.
Flights are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is equal: tens of thousands of Tesla customers crash orders
Electro-tausendsassa Elon Musk offers a huge number of prescriptions for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has previously suggested that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their unconditional reservation.
In addition to the ever-increasing number of sales increases and even giant targets, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk first reported another, less bright number in the new mass market model 3.
In the past months, Musk has often acquired more than 500,000 orders for the new car, which has just begun its delivery.
Now there is music: Of the total 518.000 orders, 63.000 have already been returned.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only about unbinding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla pays EUR 1000 (in the United States $1,000 and in the United Kingdom $1,000) "Reservation payment" in full.
At the present time, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made, and music was introduced in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla-Chief does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could be a problem.
Its argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth goals is not in demand, but on the production side.
In the past year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models will be 500,000, a million in 2020.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, bookings are currently made by day 1800.
Anyone who orders a "model 3" today may first calculate the delivery in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to drive its brand new and never in practice production routes without major interruptions with maximum discharge.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are too many delays, then the independence of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't prevent unsatisfied customers from running away from it.
The EPA Chief Pruitt is returning due to the urgency of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being accused by 15 countries, Scott Pruitt, the Chief of Environmental Protection, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-Era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency demonstrated the needs of the public environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a federal court.
It is about a deadline for States on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for near-lower ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the observance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "insulting into local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Pruitt, who, prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, was the state attorney of Oklahoma, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations that replace the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industry.
The sudden shift from the middle of the week is the latest legal withdrawal for the jury's regulatory rollback agenda.
In the past month, a federal court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a regulation of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanleks.
In an opinion published at the midweek meeting, Pruitt suggested that his feedback to Ozone Standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of the timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to keep the deadlines for implementation and is expected to be charged by active groups and others and, in agreement, to establish the deadline for implementation," said Prutt, who charged the EPA more than a thousand times in its previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by means of a judicial procedure, and we take seriously the deadlines.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us."
However, the EPA’s opinion was that Pruitt will at any time use its "power to remember and all other legal powers available" to ensure that the rules "based on a solid policy and the best information available".
The Republicans at the Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
The implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed for at least eight years in the last month.
The measure was not yet adopted in the Senate.
The New York State Secretary-General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of States that had accused the EPA this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans affected directly by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York concludes in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the Columbia District.
Ground ozone when harmful substances from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health environment and environmental protection experienced surprising change in fruit.
"It is encouraging to see how much pressure it takes to make this reasonable step by the responsible person for the protection of the air we agree with," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue our fight against the ideological cross-over of the Trump government to provide environmental damage and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 Years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the church of the church, the old Friedhof area will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, 16.30.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the site is the historic St. Hilarius facility a favorite place to rent.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-series can get away from this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the area have made friends and promoters of Tumlingen to their cause.
Walter Martini points out: "It's a unique door-to-side little boy."
In 1267, the St. Hillaryuskalle was first mentioned in the Urkunddenbech württemberg book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and Vogtei" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
In addition to the single Church of the Church of Tumling, the word of the Church stood on the Mount of Tumling was also a noble court, which was part of the Church or the Patronats' right and did not turn around.
So people lived there too.
According to the description of the town of Oberamtes Freudden, in 1858, it was next to the underground and Oberdorf, which is still known in the local image of Tumlingen, the "mount" of the third, the dominant settlement of the village.
Old maps from the time of the year 1600 underpin these historical events.
The Patronats' right was derived from the East-West Law of Owners' Church.
A Lord who built, equipped and occupied a priest remained owner of this church and could also destroy it.
In this connection, the right to use a horse or to propose a new horse was conferred on the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two hours on the tower.
The larger of the two rose on Christmas night 1673.
The newly acquired clock then collapsed for the first time in 1692, but later in World War II in 1942.
During the 30-year-old war (1616–1648), the windows were closed and the bells were burned.
The roof was forgotten.
In 1796 French troops were stored near the church.
They brought out the canzels and church chairs and used them as fuel.
The rest of the church were forced to intervene in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Freedhof also served as the last resort for the deaths from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the Peace Court was expanded and the Hillary Church was dissolved.
Just let the church tower stand.
In the new night of 1834, a storm broke into the church tower and half broke down.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken.
Only today’s premier tour continued as a witness to the 750 years of church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wazem from the "Schaffigen Rentners" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumlingen's day, July 16th, are taking the sixth serenade to St. Hillaryuskalle.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words made by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mr. Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Place of arrival is from 15.30 p.m.
In order to explain the serenade, you will find a turning point in front of the Peace Court.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view of Wiesen into the forest," the organizers make the fantastic view out.
The serenade is only located in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumlings and hearing aids.
The friends and promoters of Tumlingen feel especially obliged by home care, as Serenade-Organiser Walter Martini confirms.
One wants to verify the approval of windscreens
"Boishheim remains" does not see any legal condition for the construction and therefore has been connected to the land.
The "Boisheim" association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boishheimer network.
You've been legalized.
The Union argues that no wind power plants could have been allowed at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boishheimer network, since at the time in Thursday there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants is basically possible, while the concentration zone affects an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
These areas are designed to prevent a "suspending" of the landscape.
However, a few days before a change in the area use plan, the city had decided a second air-concentration zone in the Boishheimer network - which did not allow the district government Düsseldorf because of a failure.
"With the lack of planning legal conditions, the granted authorisation decision is still pending and therefore also to return," said Christoph Rekens, president of "Boishheim remains."
Current status of things: The city has re-decisioned the air concentration zone in the Boishheimer network before the summer break; there is no permission from the local government.
"This is why the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind power plants is excluded from planning law".
The circle confirms the entry of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been entered for the past week at the circle of Thursday," said one speaker.
The circle shall take the initiative to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to prevent the procedure from being terminated.
In view of the ongoing proceedings in the Court of Justice, the circle of Thursday did not wish to exclude itself from the argument of the "Boishheim" association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four 200 metres high windmills on a site on the Boishheimer network.
Already in the past year, the company, which is centrally involved in the city, had concluded contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large land.
With the establishment of the four wind power plants, the electricity demand should be covered by around 11,400 households - that corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand for all fours of the households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
In the past summer, Viersens Citytrat provided green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen and for a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: A woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on L 333 between the Netherlands and the Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Creis).
A woman was killed for that.
Two other people were easily injured.
The country street remained closed for hours.
A 17-year-old woman from Bornich with her Pkw in the context of the accompanying ride with her 53-year-old mother is accompanied by L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealer plans "Home Shops" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region were to re-discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September.
The company and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents into the internal city for sale.
As the president of the Company, Christian King, announced, the "Home Shops" weekend should make customers aware of what offers the city owns outside of the ordinary supermarket product.
The plan is then a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the business of the city should be invited to the "Mittnight Shops".
In this way, the action is not limited to the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation there will be advertisingpots on the radio, an Internet video and printed beet that points to the action weekend, so Christian King.
City administration and business associations cooperate with the industry and the Chamber of Commerce.
So the company and the city go to another stage of the "Attractive City" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Activ day" to the Brunnenfest and the sold Sunday, talks with all operators and currencies to move them into active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the sighting on parking charges on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-closed or re-closed.
This includes curgages and tourists.
But many locals would have lost their city when buying from the scene.
At the end, everyone had to contribute to living in the city - up to the rent, the business of the whole city and the union.
It was appropriate to overcome the lethargy, which was partly widespread with a network, that the king had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, leader of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, shared that he participated in the third "Home-Shoppen" day, first five Thuring cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, this Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy City and Bleicherod.
The day is to "recognise the value of the local trade and make it more clear to the public of our cities," says the newspaper.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his own immediate environment with his purchasing behavior.
Two deaths and several injuries after explosion at US schools
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were tortured.
At a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more injured, some of them seriously.
According to the firefighter, a victim was still in critical condition on Wednesday (Order time).
A man died as a part of a school building in the explosion.
A first missing master was later also protected.
In the case of the dead, it was about school employees.
As a result of the accident, the authorities were forced to work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday, only a few people stood in the building of Minnehaha Academy.
Trump set up a printed version of Mexican telephone calls for the payment of the border wall
The Washington Post published copies of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trup called on a telephone with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The president of the United States defeated him because he had publicly spoken to the wall, and then he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and it was difficult to pay Mexico for the project.
Transcrives of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and included an exciting exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the United States refugees who had emigrated to Australia would take "lightly", "meas" and "dam" and that the possession of the trade that was transmitted by the government of Obama would make him look like a "dapp" after he had proposed a ban on the movement of refugees in the United States.
Mr. Trump concluded the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unacceptable call for the whole day."
Mores Ford Masker: Activists lead racist Lynchatt as a call for justice again
A 1948 Ford Mercuriy was visited by a group of visitors in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and jumped onto the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns went ahead to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a middle-aged man in a nadel race train - took a long train on his cigarette and looked through the windscreens.
In the meantime, the insects moved in fear.
"We want this n--r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screaming the style when a young black man was knocked out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a follow-up.
But when a sledge is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience stand out very real drivers.
Since 2005, civil rights officers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to pick up the night, in the two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - arrived at Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with murder.
"It is really incredible that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped to organize the follow-up.
"It's a shame on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old congressman in the state of Georgia and a life-long citizen lawyer.
For him, the postulation serves as a dramatic call for trade and gives an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want punishment, we want punishment, we want healing, we want relief, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot attain healing and relief until we receive justice."
A court doctor puts a statement on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NCBs, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding graffiti were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on free foot for decades, citizens' lawmakers say that the double motivation for Lynch actions in the whole city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer elections.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom had a white base owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight down - apparently because of a woman.
Brooks said that the funeral in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcoms Mrs. Dorothy and that the baby she took did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Roy Harrison, a prominent white owner, paid $600 to release Malcom from prison.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murder," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the State and the local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the murder, destroyed evidence and confused the identity of witnesses."
Brooks is even more famous.
"It was an election mask," he said.
"They were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, you will experience this here."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual follow-up of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Its appearance is spectacular, exciting and is rooted in a kind of deep racism, which many want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look, and even harder to look, but Green said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynchen, because then we will be confronted with its complexity in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been thinking."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 players – a dozen white and the rest of the black – started in a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is a Greens Co-Registrator.
He's been playing the role of the Chief Clanmit for years, but he said the role won't be easier.
"I feel sick because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to get this story back in life because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, players Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, try their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, the heater moves and weighs him, saying he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, n-- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona provokes the fire.
There's a break.
Then every soul will be cast out in an open place.
Green laughs at the loudest.
"Was?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't think people were white at that time saying 'n--he'."
"But," said one of the other black dealers.
"You just have to meet the heart of 'R.'."
And that's exactly where the energy goes in the space, a feeling of the camera company replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it's black and with neural pressure.
No one's absolutely wrong.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There's noise, shocks, and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a wedding dress, stands above the actors' bodies and leads Billie Holidays to sad Lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Your voice comes in every second word.
About a hundred meters below measured a group of about four dozen viewers of white and brown eyes.
The audience is divided almost equally between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, are anxious to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced almost eight hours of pressing moisture in Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the killings have remained an anecdotes, but now, if you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder takes place, the air feels slent.
When the last notes of the song are finished, Greene invites the number to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children look at their heads, register the felicity blood and the stable bodies and flirt with each other.
"They're not really up," a little boy smiles as he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks to the amount - and suddenly it is over.
The players remove the Lynchseil and remove their trains.
Bradshaw smells Marbaugh, the man in the ring who played the clanmit.
Nick Rascona smiles at two of his players and then smiles in their arms, and the emotional burden of the performance is finally passed on to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Later, the audience will meet with the players for dinner.
On a table a white couple from Atlanta boasts about the follow-up with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski therefore struggled to find words that made him feel left out.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said.
"What's really going on with me, let me believe that Lynchen is still going on," she added, "Today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table, eats and remembers the rights of citizens.
He said he's already started planning the launch next year.
"The follow-up is definitely inspiring, because it describes the shocks of what we have experienced, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is sentenced to repeat it."
The Wagners in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, Director Frank Castorf places a fair-frequency insulation before giant, six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-square-square.
The Drehbühne (designed by Aleksandar Denic) is probably a famous street corner, as well as the Maurerest and Dunerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Ellaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Tower.
There is an open Mercedes-Oldtimer in which the rheintellers place as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stable olives remember Castorfs Leitmotif - Money, Power and Geer - which is derived from his "Ring" insensitivity.
The three rheintellers - healings by Stephanie Woodzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess conducts Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drying a body in Hollywood-Manier and giving the Krawallo-Click.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful beautiful hagen that surrounds the Aura of a heavy-duty boxer.
Brutal the scene when he suggests victory.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the assembly with a powerful appeal.
Strongly celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and Directant Janowski, who dress up and wash their hands to the brandy route.
Large beads are available for the festival orchestra, which first shows itself on the stage - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his regime was expected with excitement.
If he had another valid pfeif concert in 2013, there was five years later a big jubelt in which the united "Buh" race was held.
The fetishman Katharina Wagner may have been pleased with this.
"I notice that the audience has been involved with the "Ring" in some way," she said shortly before the dpa was launched.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also increased its understanding of its way of view.
I'm going to take a positive summaries.
Max Quantity works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their holiday year.
Where is it?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the Furnace, once a week I help out here in Greven in the Furniture.
And I've been working at school all day long.
How are your experiences in this regard?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to work with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old, so you're a late volunteer.
How's that going?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, we say again, successfully cancelled.
I knew for myself that it was the wrong thing for me and I wanted to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked what you're doing.
Make a social year, there's an idea that you can see how it is in place, perhaps in the background, it's true.
What was it like?
Amount: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my study in the social class in the winter.
I'm going to study twice, probably do social work training and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different employers during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's always going to happen where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from age to youth - in all possible stages of social work.
It was very different with me.
I was also part of the OGS, so in the afternoon service.
For me, that was the right thing to do.
I could recognize my own strength and see how it really works.
What about the engineering study?
Amount: Of course, this is not why it is not going to calculate statistics.
You always have other people in your head who have a whole different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, or a youth who has been expelled from the family, must always be personally involved.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any contact calls?
Amount: I'm not the type for this.
It's a field that has a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of friendship.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life goes.
Pearson cuts more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividends to restore the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will build more than 3,000 jobs and cut its dividends by 72%, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which was announced by Director-General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, it has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost-sharing programme a cost-sharing plan for another 300 million dollars (394 million US dollars) to relive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which in the past month had invested in Penguin Random House with the Bertelsmann partner, said that the outlook for the business year was unchanged after it had reached an increase of 1 per cent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato soldier killed by suicide
A suicide victim attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a soldier of the Nato and wounded several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and a dolmetscher were injured, shared a Nato statement with them.
Unconfirmed local reports have resulted in the death of three civilians in the village of Kararabagh.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has met this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday a suicide victim killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In Nato's opinion, the explosion on the Donnerstagbend had occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised pressure rate taken by people".
The statement states that all victims are in a stable state and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Kararabagh is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly skiing district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had done this attack.
On May 31, a violent bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack in the country, since the US-led troops defeated the Taliban in 2001.
Violence undermines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last few weeks, the suicide rates in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies and, in particular, in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses the decision to delay the smog rule by complaint
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has decided to delay the regulation of Obama's government, to raise the obligation of the States to withdraw smog-producing emissions, which occurred one day after 15 states accused the Agency of the step.
The EPA later announced on Wednesday the decision to implement the so-called "Ozone Provisions 2015" and said that it would show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in the dialogue and that we respond to our public partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Prutt announced the EPA's intention to measure ozone requirements in a part of the country's harmful emissions in order to determine where cuts must be made in order to maintain stricter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018.
A group of 15 large democratic states, together with the Colombia region, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to bring back a wide range of environmental platforms, which the former President Barack Obama has set up, as part of a broader agenda, which, according to Trump, is to bring about economic growth.
However, efforts have solved the decline of democracies and natural protection groups, which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the intake of air, which contains the ozone, can reduce the lung function and enhance the breathing symptoms, such as Asthma.
Community-wide needs Community space
At the end, the decision was clear: In two conflicts, the Council decided to set up a Community space in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing part is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will continue to exist until the area of the church is in the community, there is now no planning obstacle to the project of a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community space for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to confront the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with approximately 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the Community Council are moving towards such a Community area not only as a meeting point for the residents of the elderly but also as an open-ended community.
For example, the word "Strickcafe" made the rounds.
The decision, which has already been forwarded in the past autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget, will be taken by means of promotional opportunities.
The building is in the sanatorium.
The establishment of a Community space would, according to Tjaden, be compatible with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision to signal to the investor that in this respect it is not intended to strike a link between the legs, the determination that both satellites - which is related to environmental construction - and Pultdach - would be possible.
It's unnecessary, so it's not just Wilfried Sohmmer, be this addition.
If he helps, he's going through the gremium.
It's not that simple, it's going to the Community room.
Daniela Ruf refers to many of the own buildings with which you do not go so directly, so that you are now going out of the window in the community room, she says, "I do this very hard."
Yvonne Staiger is talking about the Community room, however, absolutely against a community involvement.
She sees below a hidden subsidisation of all or even external investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, there is no appeal, but there is a real, double-marketable argument.
Mr Staigers' request for an appropriate extension of the proposal for a decision is provided by three speakers.
This is the case with two amendments to the original programme, which the Stefan Haller sets out as follows: "If we make the decision so, we will make a huge step towards closing a giant failure in our infrastructure."
Kollision with car: Radler is locked on the street
At the corner of the road, an 82-year-old driver was found on Wednesday in Garath by a car and was severely injured.
As reported by the police, the 82-year-old long-distance field was on its way by 12.20 a.m. on the way to the Black Road from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road At Buchholzer Busch.
A Pkw leader in the same direction gave him advance.
When the long-distance field was on the road, he apparently did not understand the traffic.
He stopped with a car that controlled a 66-year-old hilder.
The man was locked on the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a lifeboat.
FC Bayern München has to abandon David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borusia Dortmund
The Supercup finds no place for him: David Alaba has to let the game go against Dortmund.
With personal care, the FC Bayerns travel to the first stage of the new season to Dortmund.
Seven professors are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the poker winner.
Staff care at the German football record teacher Bayern Munich will be increasingly larger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pocalsier Borisia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also ignore David Alaba in duell with the BVB.
That was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, Munichers are missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boating, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five download sites in the last six games, Ancelotti has taken responsibility for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the play of his team.
"We know we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season.
"Foutball is also tactical, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my husband shows these qualities.
The men are ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "hard, intense game".
The Dull of the two German football contests takes the fans in their gang.
The party was sold with 81.360 visitors, the German football League (DFL) shared with him on Friday.
Wander in the heart of stars to stars
In the heart, the first "star path" is to be created suddenly.
This plant of the United Stargate Sankt Andreasberg.
One planet path is in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" reflects the need for information by many heart visitors, it said.
It connects nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up the planned route tables and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase up to 2018, the Union plants "achievable facilities in five to six locations" in the upper heart.
Inquiries came from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Siber.
The information on the tables is to be added via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Barrier freedom is also a criterion.
Later, the star path to train should be extended.
"On the star path, the viewers experience a great deal of knowledge, for example about the physical of the individual stars," said the Union.
They also learned why stars had different colors, or why a star was more light than another, although he was much more distant.
It will also reveal which star in which there is a selected star and when it is best to see.
The Union has been operating since 2014 in St. Andreasberg in Bergstadt.
The location in the centre of the National Park Harz is known as the Federal Institute for Natural Protection to the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Andromeda galaxy is visible from there.
In the United States, there has been something similar to the planetary Göttingen initiative since 2003 - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet’s orbit with its stars goes up to the Hainberg and to the Star - as well as a "external" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual planets, including the degraded pluto on the planet at the end, are set at exactly two billion degrees.
The earth thus collapses on a curve of 6.5 millimetres, while the sun, which is just 75 meters away, still loses 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planet's path is four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to the pluto takes about eight hours, walkers need a good hour to stay with Pluto.
So, it's faster than the light in the world.
The March to the next fixture would last another half years.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to invest the most exciting box struggle in the near future under 147 pounds, meet for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, up to Garcia, the unencumbered World Boxing Council Lightweight Championship, the river went down to welcome Lomachenko to the World Boxing Organization Super-Feder weight Championship.
According to Garcias, by a unanimous decision on the former four-division World Master Adrian Broner on showtime, both combaters are members of the top five pounds-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you doing, champion?
I wish you so much happiness."
Lomachenko defends his throat against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19 a.m. on ESPN.
When the pair of photos took place, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm an ex-federal weight," said Garcia.
"I'm up for a broner [about 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get out of light.
And he has to move towards lightweight [135 pounds], and then we will fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Klimas asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that had to fight Lomachenko with a 135-pound deck this year, in order to agree on a date with Garcia next summer (37-0.30 Knockouts) of also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title struggle in the forum on 23 September.
"This fight could take place in Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and moved out later to fight the network that offered the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can cause this kind of attention.
When they're always ready ... "
Garcia said he loved Lomachenko as a "great fighter", and he might be involved in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the great lobby for Garcia and said that he thought that the triangular champion from Riverside saw "very slow out, I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted the Ko-Aus."
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then box it.
They both said they could smell the moment they built for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work for it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighter, and that's Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Four-in-a-Row
In an A7 accident, four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before 16.30 a.m. on the market.
The Pkw went right into the box, where he stepped over and then lay on the roof in the trunk.
The four insects - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the victims by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked in the north for about an hour and could then be driven on the left road at the accident site.
Fortunes Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after 2:2 the season will catch up with Braunschweig, the optimisation of the transformation in Aue points.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result, there would not have been the two giants at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two giants too much, and we have to improve in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The three-way chain should also be optimised in the mountains.
And after a freehouse, a tower doesn't want to catch the fortunes anymore.
"For the future, it will be so that no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew will be better equipped to prepare for the three-year course than with the four-year-old.
"I still don't know how to act in Aue," said his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we have players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"It's a preposition, but that we're still better harmonizing and we don't have so many players in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also runs to Aue to win the game.
"But you can talk after a disagreement with a failed start, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"But if we come down with four points on Sunday and we can concentrate on the pocal, we will certainly be able to speak from a good seasonal catch."
His trainer didn't want to know anything about that.
"The start in the season I'll only review six to eight days after the game," said Friedhelm Functional, who did not want to speak out of an advantage against Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be interrupted in advance because of an unwinder.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Fückel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresher, since they had no hard and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing advantage in the bones.
"But they don't know as much as 100 percent where they are at the moment," says Fortuna's Internal Defender.
However, the guests from the Rhineland go as light favorite on Sunday to the final (fast) stadium of Aue.
"That we remove them only because we have the claim to come under the first six," says the function, whose balance is positive when only a download against Aue from nine games is positive.
"There is no man in the 2nd Federal Republic, which must be beaten first," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"A statement like that would be arrogant and excessive."
And that's how funkle wants his players to experience no case on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asyllator assessment test published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of tested persons are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicines Authority (the Court of Justice) has initiated the testing in the past year.
During the asylum process, they should enhance the appreciation of the elderly after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrating Network) has been criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct ageing of some refugees who were under-yearly.
To date, the migration network has sent 6.880 test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results from 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eight percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "probably 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johann Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results remain constant in the past months.
"We see no great difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed over 18 years does not mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases "proposing that the examined person is 18 years old".
When the Svenska Journal of Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she concluded that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old in this year.
The method of medical age assessment, when taking care of wisdom signals and MRT intakes of bone links, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticised in some areas.
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological range of people to see whether they went before or after the Pubertat.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do it as if we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of treating a child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk is that if the person is nearly below 18, in this case it is about 10 percent."
Full and Plan
The work on the three bridges of the land road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well ahead.
On Wednesday a seven-ton heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it runs great," says Reinhold Leicht, constructioner at the Department of Roads and Transport in the government's Freiburg Bureau.
In April, the work began at the same time at all three necessary healing bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is planned for October and light is sure that the timetable will be maintained.
The first bridge, from Schramberg, leads over the trombach.
It is a wooden bib bar from concrete, which is covered with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the two other bridges, they have come in the middle of the years.
In order to ensure stability and transport safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly cured.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They're built from red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, respectively 10,60 meters long.
The bridge on the site of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 metres wide and seven tonne of so-called bridgeheads on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a border fixing which is also used as an operating path.
On the south side of the bridge, a width of 2,20 metres will be used on Friday.
Then you should walk along the path.
This is especially because it is a patent of Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already covered with the patented brake heads.
Special fingerprints have called for the delivery of instructions by the construction work in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass-fascinating cable connected to many companies.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by handlists.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building and the collectionway in Schramberg direction, the transport is regulated by an apel.
For the construction work at the bridge at the Lauterbacher location entrance, the road to the bridge is completely closed at the height of the hotels "dannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The costs for the three bridge repairs total EUR 700 000.
It will be financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German Cartofyl salt
It is not often expected that parties are drawn to a beach, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is only hard to bring under a hat.
The parties present on the day of the Vulcanies (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Link) are a broad band that shows the flag at this day peacefully because the AfD in the Gerolsteine Town Hall roundell called the "great election cap" on the platform.
And a known name brings to the start - as Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, forms the top duo for the Federal Day election on 24 September, and the deputy federal president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the afD students, but to demonstrate.
The word "The Eiffel is still burning."
The city-picknick was originally planned under the motto "All at a table" on the bridge, but now it is located on the park floor below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
It's a beautiful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the Forum, is a world and one of the most meaningful organizers, is truly happy: "Toll, how many people have come together here."
There is music and every amount of food, including a "urban cardofel salad that could also eat the AfD without trouble," says the woman who brought it with him.
The police have ordered many officials to go to Gerolstein, showing presence in particular at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the event areas.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the Vulcanievel AfD that he had been working on such an event and received the invitation.
The 45-year-olds from Gönnersdorf had initially been questioned in Daun, but there was a complaint because there were not enough parking spaces for the already built Laurenteuskirems.
So the roundell, Hopes, is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking at the event on the round table, he says: "This is the good law of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
This is also true: at 20 o'clock, there is a band for maintenance in the city hall of several speakers, including the Rhineland-Pfalsian AfD-President Uwe young.
In the hall there are about 200 audiences waiting for the top candidates for the Federal Day election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal presidential Beatrix of Storch to hold their talks.
The police presence is unchanged, but the officers had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour remains for the AfD event, which guests on the front desk have a longer breath, but there is also a short walk of 21 hours.

An audience with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is present in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts in the morning, Sunday, about 20 hours in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he has a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets on Blackwald", or also "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German training with lyrics in the Blas music.
Both soloists are winners and prizers of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompter at the renowned concert building Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the Solopopounist of the SWR Symphonie Orchester.
Both agree not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to break the limits of the different genres.
So explains Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new game, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the "Exchange Suite" piece of the jazz priest Niles Wogram, the classics, jazz and the free games to a fascinating overall art.
This programme's core was launched this morning with great success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote himself for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klaster Church with its special austic will be aware of the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love frozen cheese and will eat it to the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality.
"When I'm in a broken box, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what comes next?'
The most famous relationship of Hollywoodstar was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally suffered a change.
Despite all of this, the brilliant dealer guarantees against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I've been in love with everything I've ever done.
Or do you think I was playing it?"
After their separation, Christians said that they were bisexual: "I have always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it's never bothering me or stopping me.
I just didn't want it to be taken seriously."
In particular, she said, "Bang Showbiz" but in school, when she liked to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I felt really hurt, embarrassed and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, ‘ Girls, be proud of you!’
Especially to the public, they do not like their life of love: "People expect you to treat you in a certain way and that offends me.
And maybe I'll be known as some unannounced, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he's changing the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced to Donnerstagbend at a meeting with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you many prayers and many meditations ... today I will tell you as a people of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The customer service went out in Jubel.
"I will change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously made a big announcement at West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not congratulate democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, called Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he owns coal mines in five countries, and has stolen a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $159 billion.
In the meantime, the National Committee of the Republican Affairs made a statement on Thursday, in which it said: "The change of the party by Governor Justice is another step forward for a democratic party that would prevent us from working more than that to make our country grow again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the smallest legal entities in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from above to below and is not capable of finding a positive message," RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "extraordinary" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world leader of the Leichtatelettics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as a public apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he continued, not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sport.
Russia's Lichtahletik chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress in front of the Lichtahlekik World Championships that his country's connection was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said that he was sorry for "all the athletes who were removed from competition with gold and silver medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress approved the maintenance of the ban, which was imposed in November 2015, following a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on Stately promoted Doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the rapporteur.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation had recognized itself that it had experienced some pretty hot times and is doing everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned."
Coe said he was also "satisfied" that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can to normalize this situation in the coming months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean Athletics from the missed system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will be represented at the Leichtateletik World Championships, which begin on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral actors.
The leader of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for a reconfiguration.
Drugs are still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a speech at the IAAF Council.
Trauette for soldiers in Mali
At a holiday party in the Nordic fritzlar, about 1,000 people were thinking about the two soldiers who came around in a hibschruberebstrührtz in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of Judgment under high security conditions.
The defense minister Ursula from the Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the yet unexplained reason.
She named the two rounded pilots, but she referred to them as "Kings of Her Science."
"We welcome the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old headman from Nordhessen came to live a week ago in West Africa.
Her wounds were transferred to Germany and brought with her on Thursday by a federal death guard in the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter.
At first, only the members of the church took part on Wednesday.
The family, the single friends, the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the politics began to celebrate the holiday.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The sad guests brought down the roses, the members of the army stood in arm on the mountains.
Before the church, the ceremony was followed by freermen and many soldiers.
The Minister of Defence of the Leyen referred to the surrounding soldiers as "highly decorated" and simple techniques.
The Stabshaupmann had established the flight operation of the tiger's fighter driver in Fritzlar and had been one of his first six trained tiger pilots.
People of Bauershas, commander of the regime, who belonged to the soldiers, also stated: "If this occupation could not have opened the castle, no one would have been able to do so."
The Minister of the League did not show any doubt at the UN mission in Mali: the use was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the tears were brought out of the court.
When and where they are ordered, the federal court did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik wants no grave in addition to his wife
The man of the Danish King Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be ordered in addition to his wife after his death.
That's what the king's house shared with him on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish King's couple will be present in the church of Roskalde.
The picturehaer Björn Nørgaard has already produced a sarkophag for the two.
The queen agreed with the decision of her husband, and it continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it's still unclear.
But he did not intend to be included in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a joke that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife, Margrehe, died in 1972, he was willing to become king.
In 2016 he went to peace and also released the title "Principal".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted, he did not view himself as equal to his wife - neither after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last peace stations of the 83 years will be finally, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be represented in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he worked for in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, had met Margrethe in 1965 in London.
On the subject he worked in the French message.
During his later wife’s sympathies of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult situation in his nearly 50-year-old government with the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Some months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was changing, I preferred wine instead of beer, side drums instead of strip socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, Tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who instead of Virginia-Tabak, who had the chance to be the brand of social critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for the next.
I was different.
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed of me.
That was the same two errors!"
Prime Minister Weil wants to rush Neuwahl
CDU and FDP for possible majority in Lower Saxony
The Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is not willing to return after the loss of the red-green government force for a rapid renewal of the country's day, but he does not want to return.
It is because on Friday we are talking about Parliament's resolution.
Before that, the surprising Austria of a Green Aborigines from its Dutch daily group had hit the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.
Five months before the official term of the country's election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its short majority vote in Parliament on the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Absorbed Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in its selection circle in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group Chief Björn Thumler wants to recommend that his group take them.
In this way, CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Dutch Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
Until then, the relationship was changed.
The new country day will be chosen regularly on 14 January.
Thuller said that the red-green government should now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without the majority.
Stephan Weil, however, makes it imperative that the country's day decide as soon as possible its own solution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further proceedings.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Minister will withdraw his trust on the day of the country and choose a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be checked fairly clean," said Thuller.
"The man will discuss all the questions in peace when they are duly examined."
Thumler called the Twesten step "but something cool."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a rapporteur.
I feel very good."
She was known as a member of the Black Green.
The Greens called on the decoupling Members to return their country's mandate.
"We will naturally conclude that it is her country's mandate that she received on the Green List, with immediate effect," said the presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Green Group president Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of each of the tweets."
She has decided not to give a speech in the group.
"And even before the background that there were no substantive differences, we can't follow this step."
SPD-Canning candidate Martin Schulz condemns the overstepping of the Dutch Green Officers each tweet to CDU as a bribe.
"The behaviour of the former Green Commissioners in Lower Saxony is not only against the voters and voters, but also against the Red Green," the Federal Minister of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country's day.
The Austrians of Twestens spend most of their red green in Lower Saxony.
Politicians are "in their damaged appetite and in their fruits their personal interests before the welfare of the country", criticised SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony in this dirty intrepid game tries to beat political capital."
Mr Björn Thuller, Head of the Lower Saxony CDU Group, would recommend that his members take each issue into the CDU.
The Head of the SPD's Group in Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, proposed that tweets, with personal career memories, be accompanied by the results of the 2013 country election.
The CDU was then the strongest force, SPD and Green before the SPD, but on the day of the country, a very high majority of a voice.
Minister for Agriculture at the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from weddings, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing counterfeit eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the Edits network Germany (RND) speaking and answering.
Mr. Schmidt, how can the consumer protect themselves from the exposed eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the voice pressure.
At the Consumer Protection portal www.foodmechannung.de, the Federal countries provide the latest information on the eggs concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all we know now, health threats are virtually excluded.
Now Aldi takes the best possible crisis reaction - all of the self out of the offer - because the central role of the prosecutor is not really taken by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Nevertheless, my house has been uninterrupted and has been known by Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
The trade has to be as much as the manufacturer is concerned that the products sold are safe and sound.
If the maximum residue of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, these are not transportable.
Unpaid eggs may, however, be sold and consumed.
This time, the company is not responsible.
Do production companies and consumers sit on the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production company is not liable directly.
More and more, they must be calculated on the basis of illegal practices of service companies with economic damage.
As always, there are too few controls.
Is it only in the staff or also in the key responsibility?
However, there were only the official controls that have covered the process.
However, it is also true that food consumption and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 per cent.
That is why a consistent explanation of such cases and the transfer of the State authorities to cases where they may be prosecuted is of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to make an unfavourable statement.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food canals?
Consumers and consumers have the right to access only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers and consumers shall be entitled.
By means of the pendant, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have become in a situation that is not absolutely necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the legitimate use of fipronil insecticide in the holding of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be followed at all levels and worked with high pressure.
I expect all the competent authorities to make the matter clear and unambiguous.
How the financial rules of the football match to Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure by the European Football Union will not be broken down by Neymars World Records Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences are still coming from the UEFA for Paris Saint Germany, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to prevent men from accessing the prestigious champions League tournament.
Financial Fair-Play rules, which were adopted in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG must at once prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a loan worth several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG can certainly make the money locker so that Neymar can sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team through the energy rich family of the governor of Qatar.
One can use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but it is necessary to control legitimate input sources that allow them to break-even points in their business on football.
FFP was appointed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that the companies that had successfully assumed huge debts in their efforts were effective and risking ruining themselves if banks or owners returned their support.
In 2011, FFP lost its focus on the debt of the Clubs on monitoring their losses.
The amendment meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the population and build a global market - should be a better case.
During the current three-year FFP settlement period running by 2018, Clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini 2015 has fallen in Hungary, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, continues to refrain from excessive expenditure.
"Surely FFP is not up to and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traversso, who is responsible for the UEFA for the FFP, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Buy Out clause of Neymar in a break-down scale, it can share the amount for the calculation of the duration of its contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the amount of the cancellation for the next five years can be expressed at EUR 44.4 million in the year-end.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, who is owned by Manchester City, with the worst sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at the time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 season champions remain limited to 21 players instead of the other 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to overlook their financial perspective by suspending their acquisitions by companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a Chinese company could speak the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this as a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was highlighted by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar from the WM 2022 organizational committee.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have argued that Neymar will become a WM messenger and could simply be a manoeuvre for UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more aware of any attempt to change the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who were confident of the situation.
They speak under the terms of anonymousity with The Associated Press, since they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last business year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymars to arrive a victory for Sponsoring Deals, Merchandising and Trikot sales.
The agreement concludes that the consumption will be increased by at least 30 per cent after the signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irradiated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars from leaving by claiming that PSG would damage the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial Doping" with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose union is owned by an American sports tycoons, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a union.
"It is the consequence of ownership and it has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a union, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Scogging Provider
In the past years, Chocolate Free Board chocolate has been made for the Swiss.
Now the sweet co-operation is ahead of a possible end: The airline is writing the order again.
Swiss speecher Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on the request of the news agency sda an appropriate report of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolate Frey, we are very pleased," said the speaker.
About 17 million small rotor-packed boat tables of 14 grams a year share the flight crews before landing on the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Industry sides estimate the order volume of North-West Switzerland to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual rate of around one billion francs.
More important, however, is the advertising effect: For a Scotch manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
As many competitors are present at the new release, the Swiss will not be disappointed.
But only Swiss producers are concerned.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to try to renew the agreement on spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate tables have been distributed by the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tables in cooperation with Hugh.
The opportunity to place the logo led Swiss two hundred years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolate Free.
The airlines work together with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-term flights, the customers of the first class will be relieved by the confiscate Springli, in the Business Class near the Passage Schoggie von Lindt and in the economy of the Scoggy Class of Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short line, Swiss Shoggy shares chocolate Frey, both in the business and in the economy class.
Lyrics - disk-Olympical Robert Harting reaches WM-Final
The dreaming world master fights on Saturday at the end of a medal.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympicser, was divorced in the national WM divorce and could only look at the discus competition from the Tribune.
In addition, with the first attempt, the Polish champion Peter Malachowski, who was far away, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the Nice
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the '80s' character of the 90s, for the '90s-year-old-old' era (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter drove the Sketch comedy 'The State' for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and a corruption of our Facebook ability to retain permanent memories.
But like Franchise, it feels like time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked amazingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it included an original history of a speech dose of Gemüse, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By hiding on the core of the gag - actors middle-aged play a lot of children who will grow up - they still have the opportunity to win back the last part of the white.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults, who are now playing adults, is less emotionally upset and his parody goes further according to the Christmas principle, including a call on the filmmakers of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Looks the Wound").
At one point a character is disturbed by an Apple Powerbook, some inline scans and "a number of other things since 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanuator, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there is yet another crazy-blessed fleet, which is involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-founded impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the trips are the best part of the French.
It makes a lot of fun to see young Mr. Rudd forever, the Matt Dillon's undercover of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old kid.
There are the moments of the fall that could attach this Franchise as a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I take as his logical conclusion: "What Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the movie premiums of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon remembers another type of nostalgia: the repetition of the cold war of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even the "GLOW" with its east-west ringfighting iconography.
The comedy of Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, created by Rhys Thomas as director, is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of eight years with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism.
The main trolls - a hard-cut Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spend the time to watch chess on television, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures an appropriate game 'Find the Voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the reality of a suspected propaganda drama - a killer wearing a giant mask will be involved - that it often plays like a single.
At six long episodes, it is worth it, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited for a less long time, could better deliver his agitprop satires, since Gregor and Iosef are always visiting the American message, whose Lobby is always owned by two fat men who break a hamburger's neck.
The message for the imaginated communist audience is that Western culture can make everything food for a plant.
The fictional Romanian creatures did not lie: We do it even with our own younger history and with theirs.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police have won a battle against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were examined in the Blackwald Bar Cross, Rottweil, Constants, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the government administration Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were convicted and were already sentenced to court orders against them.
In addition, the officials secured the largest amounts of marijuana and cocaine, weapons and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy.
Against the two suspect Italians, there were German court orders.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, over 300 police officers were employed.
The members of the Mafia are threatened with organized drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder and rape.
Since summer 2016, the State administration has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in the South German area.
Between the government authorities in Konstanz and Palermo, there was a great exchange between the government and the authorities of the Cripo Rottweil had close daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, in the middle of the morning, four officials from Palermo were also accompanied.
In particular, the Italian state officials referred to the Italian Mafia in a reference to the survey.
An incident also occurred on May 27, in Hüfingen, when several shots were fired in a guesthouse early in the morning, should go to the band's account.
How big gaps are reported in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": A report follows the country register in Germany with significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
The Department of Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Way, has then made a media report on large gaps in the foreign central register.
Failures to the data recorded there could lead to asylum procedures and discharges "to some serious errors," warning in an analysis of the "South German newspaper".
The register includes 10 million people with foreign nationality, including 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data will then be managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data are not sufficiently stored, the data quality in parts has not been good until.
In individual cases data were found from 1921, "from people who are no longer alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"Failure of data inputs can be very demanding in return processes," the report continues.
In the statistics on people with travel obligations, there would have been a high number of EU citizens who had not yet had to travel.
However, such false arrangements led to a "closed debate on how to deal with passengers", it is said in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has opened up to send refugee families with 16-year-olds back to Italy when they are pregnant.
The entry from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) reports the "New Osnabrücken Journal".
In the paper, therefore, the BAMF is leading such procedures as "related families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, it has been virtually impossible, so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation in front of the place.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees in the EU are responsible for their first arrival.
If an immigrant continues to live in another EU country, this country can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the office now writes: "The capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has granted the reception and accommodation of families guarantees.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) holds these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The political speaker of the left-hand group in Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Family families with children suffer from the lack of human rights conditions in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare".
Two-sided result obtained
Total 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreigenbach have already made the blood donation available to other people.
At least one of the twelve citizens who were surprised on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who shared with his 100 cents between 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Community would have to spend several times on the provision of blood.
"It's great how our body is designed for it, and we will respect the taxpayers who make your blood available for foreigners, even unusable," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood allowance helps several people," explained the director of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, as the conservations are placed in their components.
So three people could already benefit from a blood transfusion.
At the same time, Maisenbachers reported on the actions carried out in Oberrigenbach in the spring.
"In this year we achieved the second result with 114 contributors," said the DRK-preparation leader.
Clearly, the change in the theater led to higher participation rates a few years ago.
Previously, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer had been counted as the multiplicity and were outstanding for each 50 pounds.
Half of the people sold Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stephanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave each 500 millilitres of their livelihood.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to be informed later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and inflation decline in speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "results" when it maintains interest rates on family income in a growing pressure.
The monetary committee's political decision-makers (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rate at 0.25 % this month, with fewer members trying to increase, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth projections for 2017 to 1.7% and 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on the budget income would continue to rise, with inflation in the brain likely to rise to less than 3%.
But she pointed out that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to increase the inflation generated by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammut Conjuncture Package issued a year after the Brexit.
It will require time for the funding plan to provide cheaper financial resources to banks from February to February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion dollars more available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling.
A few minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (BIP) remains relatively weak, as the pressure on the actual income of the households continues to cause consumption."
To the interest rates, she continued that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be necessary to reduce inflation and a "something bigger" scale than the markets would expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "progressively" and "limited".
According to the Bank's adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year, there are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasted May.
It has maintained its growth forecast by 1.8% in 2018.
The fund fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.
The fund fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the most disturbing growth rates have dropped the higher expectations for an increase in interest rate and the GDP increased by 0.2% in the second quarter in the previous three months by 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easily obtained by the bank at the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report is a bit of concern to households affected by increasing inflation and reduced wage increases, as the deterioration will be worse before it will be improved.
It added that the monetary policy in the coming years cannot "stop income," but it added that the wages will be "fashioned" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the growing demand for British goods, which is to return to the weak fund, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption costs.
The decision will come one year after the decline in the interest rate to 0.25 % in last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the fund's decline.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy.
Prior to the final judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the appeal was raised after an increase in interest rates, as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
In the past month, inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and that it would be reintroduced in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target would be "ganz" to write the weak fund.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the swap rates, the mortgage market should become more competitive, as credit providers look for jobs and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market is particularly good for those who run the existing dealers and close the new mortgages, and many with free-of-charge options and low-rate rates are becoming more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is responsible for sending HIV drugs to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in NHS after a battle in September before the High Court.
NHS England reported that a single pre-exposition propylaxe (PREP) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients is now delivered by health services over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He was prepared to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed in the last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PREP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The announcement announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS English chief Simon Stevens as "major new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it "distinct moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be allowed to register, and further clinics will be followed in October before it is introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Prepositions propylaxe (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infected patients.
PrEP before taking sex means that there are just enough medicines in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual activity.
For those who are concerned with treatment, there are school or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinical trials, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transitions and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered in a household can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be signed by £10 million and NHS England under a contract for the supply of medicinal products this week after an international competitive acquisition.
The study should assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, how it is used, collected and implemented at a high level.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should achieve and sustain the growing and successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is intended for needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We wholeheartedly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, president of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to conduct the study quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be released.
Now that the PREP test medicine has been created, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said: "The start of the PREP process is a month's delay and slow implementation by the government and overdue.
The evidence shows how transformative these drugs can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection can end.
This attempt brings us closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study will be conducted as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society'.
The big life: Interwoven and smart designer tricks have transformed these small Earls Court apartment into a large house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, was reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is in the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Then I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high decks.
I loved her and made an offer on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely overrun.
Originally a single room property with a broken layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a room and a middle room to use the huge deck height optimally.
"I wanted high decks, big window, lots of light.
That was my demand," she says.
To this end, she devoted the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, who used 12.5 feet high decks and created a house that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The deck was not big enough to place two rooms together, so that the architectural challenge was in order to create an interdependencies in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without having to book us.
It was not only to build a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled the heritage to place two rooms in full heights - with many additional dramas.
For the intersmoker, a classic cup light window of Retrouvius looks down on the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is stored to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, the stored units offer space for all the items and glasses of Joanne.
The beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Compulsory kitchens are nothing new.
The particular thing is that it's about a garage.
"A little engineering art went in there," explains the legacy of the reinforced MDF door.
"It's against importance, so when you climb the door, it's very easy to walk."
Thanks to the cloudy use of room and restaurant, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the basic area - or how your property will be valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estatemaker will enter into and carry out a calculation based on the ground size."
Here they have managed to expand the surface and to use high-quality materials that make the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't like the electric docks in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed by good design and an increasing number of square meters of something standardable in something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a US 500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a settlement due to one of the largest real estate empires Victorias in value of over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to share his property and business powers.
Paul had been trying to get back from the family business since 2014, but a sharp breakdown on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anna, the brothers have 38 real estates in value of more than half a billion dollars, since 1973 the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans founded the family and grew into a chain of 160 individual businesses.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the city.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - of Paul, described as "the chief operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and about one third of Paul's.
One court case states that this means Colin's property is worth $316 million and Paul's value is $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The assignments proposed by Colin have left him with what I had for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
On the last Friday, several complaints were made that the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claimed, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul proposes to manage some possessions in an incompetent manner.
In an early Affidavit, introduced by Colin, he says he hopes to help the fight.
"My Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading legal issues, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides of the law firm.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who were operating milk bars and delicate business from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood League, in Colin opened the first Jeansladens of the family.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons properly.
"Luigi often told me that he didn't want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Company Group, while Colin claims that Mark was paid for leaving the company $10 million and Luke 26 million.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "the conditions of their financial separation have become complicated."
Colin was very back, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire of the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to blame me and bring our family names through justice," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end in our current struggle," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote.
Trumps of the new Head of Staff is planning to limit the president's media allocation.
Others have tried it and have been broken.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Head of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the media, in the hope of keeping the head on a similar course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, met with leading employees on his first day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that was put in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should be flown - whether on paper or in writing - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to take a break by monitoring their media tendencies.
President Trumps' relationship to television has been getting back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.
"When the candidate Trump was upset by an incomplete reporting, it was productive to show him that he had received a good reporting of bodies that were to be trusted," said former electorate counselor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the key to maintaining the Twitter habit of controlling, said six former anti-combat officials, is to ensure that their personal media consumption contains a constant price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something we don't know about others - that Trumps tweets without their intervention would have contained more junk.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees had already made it a few times, they would have taken care of him, then their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from reproducing contradictions.
A part of the problem is that people in a white house, which consists of competing parties, always try to introduce their own agenda by presenting Trump material, which may promote their views from the world.
Politico - all in this history - reported in May on the willingness of the Council to provide the President with two-thirds of the information on strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a Vulcan to negative pressure cuts, especially such with damaged lenses, and that he understands where they come from.
At the end of February, when someone kindly printed a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accused the deputy chief Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a door to be of Lecks" in the white house.
Although Johnson had been tied out of Twitter for the sake of the scans, he did not offer any concrete evidence or that in the past he had exposed false claims and rejected them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "has tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper frame, get the drum."
How'd it go?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
He may prove himself to be a more effective manager than a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most visited criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the people's assistance will be requested and hoped.
The police are sending in this summer (virtually) postcards to dangerous criminals on the flight.
Since the addresses of the sought perpetrators are not known naturally, evidence from the population is hoped and prayed.
Europol reported on the Friday of the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar from the winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, it has been outside Europol.
There have been 21 postcards for sought offenders from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 the website is available at www.eumosanted, more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed.
36 of the online reports could be adopted so far, at least eleven of them are based on references after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millions Line'
Some of the most fortunate owners of the West Midlands are again with some determined travelers on war foot who have dealt with one of the graves taken by the community to request a field before their houses.
Travelers have parked their 20 cars in a field outside a well-being street of Solihull, which is called the "Millionary Line".
They have brought horses, babies and an army of transporters, after they were released in May only, without being forced out of a grave buried by the Council to prevent their accidents.
The active group found a breach in the defense facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unstoppable to find a way.
The Council of Solihull, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They were taken to the Montagabend there after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced by a scheme to implement it because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were further moved and are now back.
More came last night, probably even more tonight."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on the streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council can't stop this."
A resident who didn't want to be named said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be chased by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park."
A speaker from the Solihull Council said: "We are an unauthorized camp on the country outside the streetbrook Road and work together with the Solihulls police. We take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible.
In order to support our consent, it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine if we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise will be
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise will be located.
The house in front of the gates of Freudunstadt will now be renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the former Ambiente Business Society mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 nights per year were lost and also taken by the Kurtax.
In the autumn of 2014, there was a dramatic increase in the number of refugees who arrived in the countryside, offering the hotel building to the Landrassamt as a meeting place, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the supply of asylum competitors by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
At the time, the decision was not in dispute in the Community.
But, above all, the city's mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke already of a growing interest in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with business leader Birgit Schererer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary expansion in Berlin and wants to make it a house of three star Plus category under the name of Woodhotel Louise.
The group has four houses with the friend city.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in the building protection container for a long time before the entrance, and if you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work will be undertaken.
The floors were excavated, covered in part, removed old bathrooms from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's still much to do by March.
"It's really a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
All items should be rescinded in the blackish style.
The rooms will be equipped with large busy showeres, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be built.
Everything will be "good citizens" later, as Thomas Scherer expressed it.
"We want to make a beautiful piece of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are available.
You don't want to put yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but you're already at a high inner town level, stressing Scherer.
The foresthotel Louise with its about 60 rooms wants to rise wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidayers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause have already led him, so painful.
The city's ideas are the same as those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
According to the level of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to be determined exactly.
It's about a million euros, he's counting.
The external facilities are also brought to the frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard a large terrace will be available from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freden City is a good market".
Russia Affairs: US Special Representative places Grand Jury in
In Russia's affairs about US President Donald Trump, Special Representative Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
In the past few weeks, the Grim took up the work, writing the "Wall Street Journal" on people who had confidence in the matter.
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his findings.
The CNN Ambassador reported that it had already given the first floor of the panel in relation to a meeting between the oldest son of the trups and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. secret services have long accused the Kreml of joining the presidential election campaign in 2016.
Mueller examined whether there were discussions between the Tromps team and Moscow.
On the basis of the findings, there should be several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election.
As a result, Mueller also received more and more trups private and business environments under the Lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Mediar Trump had personally turned to the center and investigated the proposal whether the president might have prevented justice in the course of the business.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in cases of crime and decide whether complaints should be raised.
Thus, Grand Jurys is also known as prosecutors.
Mostly they will be activated when it comes to larger and more controversial cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The Gremium can also be activated by the government in order to invite people to be admitted under the Eid.
According to the CNN-sender, there have already been reports of cases involving the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report contained an invitation to a statement by the persons involved at the meeting.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps was also a consultant and Swiss son of Jared Kushner as well as his former electoral commander, Paul Manafort, during the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday in the U.S. television that the introduction showed that Mueller did not let himself get involved in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not be forced to say that the Grand Jury will be finally activated to decide on the collection of a complaint.
However, the introduction of the panel of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new enthusiasts, the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russian campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total discovery," said Trump.
The theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel well because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the introduction of a grand jury.
However, this work also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House endorsed any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Representative in a "fare" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he will not be exposed to the presidents.
There is no reason to accept that there has been a change in the statement.
But Mueller was used only after Trump Comey was burned.
In view of this controversy, the opposition against Trump had become loud, and he wanted to stop the justice.
In June, before a Senate Committee, Commay said that Trump had asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After the U.S. media show, the white house material was collected against the Special Mediar and his staff.
Solved speculations about whether Trump Mueller wants to quit.
Unlike an independent Special Representative of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Affairs case about the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be theoretically burned at the president's press by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators both parties want to make such a step forward.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that could no longer be left so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Eisberg runs in Antarctica
In the Westarchy, a giant iceberg was released by the nearly seventy-six size Berlins from the Schelfeis.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven of Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
Over a billion tons are heavy and over 5,800 square kilometers are now going north and it will take two, three years until it falls.
It is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades, with 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers.
A danger to humans is not coming from him.
As far as the climate change has played a role in the outbreak of the Eisbergs, research is unclear.
However, there has been a series of unusual outbreaks of ice pellets in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact-finding background.
According to many researchers, this could be associated with global warming.
The now broken Colossian was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and falls out regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located in southern South America close to the tip of the Antarctica peninsula.
North of this sculpture was damaged by the balance of growth and interruptions a few years ago.
A complete sculptor will fall there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
Some say that the Larsen C Shelfage is also in danger, because the previous edge has never returned as far as now.
In addition, the ice disk is under pressure and may fall if a piece is broken at a key station.
The melting of selfeis and Eisberg does not increase the marine mirror, as it swims on the water and ice absorbs as much water as it does after the smelting itself.
However, the loss of the skiing leads to the fact that the glaciers can fly directly into the sea and much faster than before.
This could increase the sea level, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Medas).
The Larsen C-Schelfeis, according to AWI, is the fourth largest cluster of Antarctica.
It is up to 700 metres above the Festival, on the front side to the free ocean of 200 metres.
That's where it starts regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the icechild is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the second return since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Scientists would argue that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now grow again or will return in a long time and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will last for decades.
Even if these researchers do not bring the collapse of this giant iceberg to the climate change, in the past decades, there have been a lot of ice pellets in Antarctica.
This long summit of Antarctica extends to South America.
According to data from the British Antarctica Survey, the island of the Antarctica Peninsula has been around 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctica Peninsula has heated around three degrees and thus numbers to the areas where the temperature rises at the fastest.
CDU wants a personal home account
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to have free jobs, the CDU is demanding to get out of the labor force to be more attractive.
Just before the summer break, 41 new positions in the administration were won on Wednesday.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees are back on their first day of work.
The teachings at the circle are obviously very popular.
About 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be awarded in this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are no more than 50 unaccompanied positions in Mettmann's circle.
Doctors and engineers, as well as the powers of general administration, are sought.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on Wednesday and address the lack of expertise in the administration.
The Management Board shall, in accordance with the wish of the Parties, develop a concept for the acquisition and development of staff.
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of professionals but also to address the future of the competition.
The overall concept should be based on internal and external orientation, identify concrete measures for core strengths and include an educational objective, require CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's what's going on after a good deal.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities buy good employees and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is from a regular "competitiveness of the Public Workers".
A large number of staff who are separated from the service are sick or elderly.
So the highest time to deal, so that there are no more jobs left unattended.
However, Klaus-Dieter Peoples, head of the CDU Group, goes beyond the common application with his party.
He was already worried about a sudden surprise on Wednesday when he asked about the personal cost allocation and the rest of the parties.
Peoples want to examine all the possibilities that allow an exit from the social worker association.
"If we don't come here recently to a satisfactory solution, the management of the circle with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the neighbouring cities - should seek a housing project," said the People.
In this way, the CDU tries to pay employees and employees better than it actually provides for the price standard for the public service.
The containers are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level that focuses on years of employment.
However, the tasks of the circle have been growing ever more in recent years.
Just a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, where employees were concerned about the provisions of the new protection law.
Not recently due to the rising number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Creis-Director Martin Richter have a problem: you have too few staff.
Italy forces the sound of NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs to use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German Youth Law organization because their crew had effectively worked with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has been in operation for the first time a year, has helped to make out the Italian government of Ambrogio Cartosio.
"It is for us and the salvation of human life remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we can't operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion to the social media.
"We can assess all the charges currently raised, only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Yuventa' since October.
It is suspected that his possession of Schlashboat migrants is taking on board, which are delivered directly by human dealers, and that the Schmuglers can take off in order to re-use the ships.
At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles prior to the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Government of the State of which the content of Italian media was published.
The occupation is suspected of being monitored by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue facilities in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, ships such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who oversees their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue facilities have already declared themselves ready to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Finally, on Thursday, he said that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not bring with them "significant changes or obstacles" their acts of salvation.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
In the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who came after the rescue measures in Italy had returned a lot in the past week, which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors had been made.
"In the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He made plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants left behind to reach Europe.
Upstreams and trials
Nine Weilers Biker, the "Berliner External Posts" and two guests meet in Wachenheim in the north-western courtyard to enjoy long trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley is a good starting point for the Tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelscael above the Deidesheim.
It followed points of view, partly on doors, from which one could look far across the forest and the proposed levels.
In the meantime, there were more and more loans that were paid for the long trial.
On the second day, it went to Bad Durkheim to Salin and Volksfest Wurstmarket.
Again, the focus of the perspective was selected, connected by "floating" trial and moderate approaches.
In the last two days, many heights were repeated.
The hills, the rocks, the towers, the villages, the ruins and the castles brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers enter the freeloftinhalatorium holy sun.
Neustadt was also attacked.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 altitudes, the group had known the forest farmer from his best side - sports and cultural -.
Console instead of Races - Bundesliga races for e-sport
Are the sports stars in the future in front of computer consoles, instead of fighting over the stadiums by wind and weather?
The fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, became a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high grades.
This has also been recognized by the first federations who are increasingly engaged in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two profiles for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to welcome all the new young target groups for the VfB," says President Jochen Rötgermann.
He's sure "that there's still some unity on this train."
The next week, the FIFA football world band in London organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup", where the players of different clubs compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Endhoven.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Liverkusen and Werder Bremen tells about an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football needs to be replaced, especially with the 14 to 30 years of age, that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The United States tried to overcome all possible markets, especially Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under the contract, one could be more likely to be present on these markets than to send the Federal League to Asia once a year.
What's going on?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Doto 2", "Counterstrike" or "FIFA football simulation are featured on competition level.
Long ago, as in normal sports, lies have been established in which the professions competed against each other.
And in 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But it's all about the right kind of sport?
For many, the presentation is certainly necessary.
Ingo Froböse has also been on the subject for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sporthoch school in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
There is also a need for cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid response ability.
Professional players should not only train their bodies but also pay attention to food.
"The fat player is a good player."
Frobose also sees problems: "Doping will become more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientists have a positive effect on the high integration of e-sport.
The players are internationally on their way, which is like a large global family, because there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of corporate advice Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Maintenance Software (BIU) tells e-sport that there is a tremendous growth ahead.
In 2016, 50 million euros were sold in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, consumption is estimated to be at 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion Euros of the Football Federation, this is not enough.
However, whether the e-sport "is no longer away from other established sports, such as handball, basketball or Eishockey", the Deloitte brothers write.
International is already in many countries.
Large markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-Wettan provider Unikrn.
There are some things in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a teaching course, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, football first-guereines, according to Dutt, are obliged to establish an e-sport department.
"The European comparison refers to Germany later," states VfB-Prostance Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the old times, is not enough today.
It is therefore necessary to preserve the tradition of the Union, but at the same time the company should be adapted to the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," Dutt says.
"You can't believe that it's just that it's always like it's always been."
Gift-Eier ade - The Ei-Alternatives for Cooking and Packing
Of the scandal of married couples, almost all federal countries are affected.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
In the rule only eggs should be taken, which may not contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter for the text that Conrad Roy forced to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be sentenced to 15 months of her trial behind the gates and was sentenced to five years in prison.
Carter was sentenced to life on 13 July 2014 because of the infamous murder of Conrad Roy.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is amazing.
My son was my best friend."
Carter had to stay free until he was appointed.
She had been faced with a 20-year sentence, but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr. Roy had suffered from a mental illness.
In red hair and a creamy blue, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with fallen hands and down his eyes when he was judged.
"Your actions have changed Conrad Roy," the state attorney told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own best.
She has no responsibility," she said.
"It didn't show up."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "crazy condition which she completely regretted".
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or reifegrad or even her spiritual illness has a significant impact on her actions".
A government lawyer read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, who said that "there is no day I don't care about the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will suffer for eternity with us," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdy Roy, said that she would be "followed" by the knowledge that she would never be part of her brother's wedding or be a aunt for her children.
"No longer having this one person I've been with since my birth every day, it's a pain that I've always been with for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal case because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to demand another suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car in 2014 to a carbon monoxide waste.
The case drew national attention to the fact that after Carter's text messages indicated that he had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump out of a building, start yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in two weeks before her death while she and her family were on vacation.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Directer Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and arranged that he should benefit from any pressure from the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to death in 2007 by her British resident in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, aged 30, published in Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich had to run up on the Audi Cup as a captain is not an accident.
The FC Bayern won won a big season - extra motivation does not damage that.
There was something else in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw right away, even though the extra clothing piece was very, very small.
But on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Newer to see, he kept the bonds assigned to him.
"The trainer has not announced it," said the Confed Cup winner later, after his first use as Bayern Captain.
Well, the state would have been better able to run than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But Kimmych could say the sign from the coach.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was selected as the leader of the existing C-Elf profession from young players, supporters and just from vacations, but he was.
Sugar is the most popular of those who trust many who want to stay at the laurel.
So whoever is forced to inherit Lahm, a small extra motivation can only be used well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
In the middle of the week, the 22-year-olds flew as mini-laham over the field.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bonds on the arm made her rest.
And Kimmich worked in this start-up format as one who can take the wheel in the best way.
He gave instructions to try to link the single-played troops.
He had the view for all, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal so as to overcome his lack of fitness (cracked hardly); Renato Sanches so that the demons can interfere with the services of the Asian journey (clapsed even if required); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that they do not fall negative in their first appearance in the Bayern trip.
That's all right.
The soul loved Kimmich, Rudy, before the turn, both of them acted in the sovereign.
The so-called Napoli storm has often been difficult, and the soul has also tried to make it a few times.
His colleague Rudy pointed out that the result was "not the way we expected it."
But he also showed proper performance at Debt.
Game creation, time change: "I was also arrested for this style."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new arrivals, you saw it at the end of the party.
Rudy, for example, did not have one or two interviews in the catacombs, but only six or seven interviews.
Kimmych took up a few words in the back of his new player.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Seoul: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game."
Still, he doesn't have to spend it on the new ones anymore.
Alaba motivated by OFB-Damen
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÜFB ladies
Austria's best-known football player has recently reported on Twitter and the women of ÖFB wish all the good.
The Bayern legioner is a ja quasi club member of the ØFB Captain Schnaderbeck with our Ladys.
The second of the Austrian football player of the year and the champions League winner should be a special motivation.
The famous Bayern dusel might also need our ladies.
Entrepreneurship with Rereinland-Pfalsic Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often designed as Evelyn Lemke (Green) as a Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Pfalz.
This is shown after more than a year, in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in the office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on a TV request for a change in economic policy - and at the same time, the old minister.
Frank Natus, president of the Trier Company (VTU), says: "Wissing meets the economic needs of the Lemke has blocked everything."
The biggest road use is Natus in infrastructure policy: The closure of road 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is still looking forward to a planning procedure until 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West Bank of Trier, which is in the pressing need of the Federal Road Transport Plan.
The aim is to take action in December 2020, says Prime Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a way to support regional but international competing companies.
The Industrial and Commercial Chamber (IHK) Trier, as was arranged by Wissing, seeks to introduce a Rheinland-Pfalz label in wine to increase the proportion in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to build a own company, praising the IHK.
The manual room Trier sees an additional entrance for young trainers in the new master bonus, says business leader Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 for the permanent master examination and EUR 2500 is provided when graduates make themselves self-employed within ten years of master training.
However, the list of household duties for the country remains long.
At the time of the planned road construction, there were rapid facts to create, while the country lacked the necessary staff, says Jan Glockuer, chief business leader of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want Wissing to set mobility in the country industry, only 29 jobs are available.
The IHK calls for more orders to be given to external offices.
The CDU Group View Christian Baldauf refers to estimates by the Court of Auditors that the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in the acquisition of national roads.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country as it wants to overcome the lack of expertise in the region.
In addition to the previous broadband development in the country.
In 2016 regional companies assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with note 3.4.
They complain about stocking internet connections and abuses.
In contrast, former Minister of Economy Evelyn Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Board of Supervisors of the Per Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become the president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where they had already re-examined the field after four months of disagreement.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 self-assessments - car manufacturers are faced with a counter-reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company was of the opinion that "the smartest options are for road restrictions", and therefore in European cities - including Munich, where BMW is available - to ban or restrict the vehicles themselves.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a return.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of self-fuels in Europe and the United States to support compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the Stickoxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause Asthma.
The cost of the car manufacturers to install facilities for the neutralising of the exhaust gas consumed by the self-consumer is also taken into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of the car competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of neglecting the powerful auto companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of people's cars which could regulate the use of so-called decommissioning devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but to return to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of vans, others being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the past month, the former leader of the thermodynamics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected before delivery and could be brought before the U.S. court.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in public cars, after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to change the emission rules in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be heavy burden on Volkswagens: The luxury car manufacturer contributes too disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the fleet on the island of Isar on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isir.
In order to join the Isar visitors, on the morning of Saturday, a river passes through Munich, which has a special message.
As it reaches the Isar again on Saturday, there will be a great river between the flowers and the raindrops.
And that's not a regular flight with Isar tourists.
But he wants to clear the baureferat.
On the river you see a great infotransparent.
It shows a müllberg.
The invitation to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wahre Love is ..." the understanding of the Issir is to create a valuable forest flow.
In the past summer, the fleet over the Isir and also in this year, there are further actions and measures to achieve a balanced and environmentally-friendly behaviour.
Mordilless Knollennasen and the Laken against suffering
Mordillo was then one of the most published cartoon characters, the knots of his figures are his brands.
With 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Lachen, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he fought, among others, as a drawing for luxury cards, through what frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my career was the day that I lost in my job," he once said.
According to stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 60th anniversary of the collapse: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artists of cities are constantly being inspired.
Large, round Mordillo figurines fall in drawings with the skiing turm of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the red square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is also following his own information today, working nearly ten hours a day.
Over the calendar, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, pets and watches are still found around the world.
For six years, he has also worked on a character print film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos' favorite animal in its drawings - which has a thousand fans as a player.
For the first time, his figures are in the 3D film, which is to come to the kinolin wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're saying, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The scroll is not written by him.
That is why he puts more emphasis on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced in vain.
Lavender from the Provence from the Climate Change
He has become a symbol of the Provence in South Africa, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is slow because of the conditions of the door and because of the diseases transmitted by insects, what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions prepare for major headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The Lavendel in the Provence has been effectively endangered because the plants have been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has effects on the life of Lavendel.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits the zwirgzikad, and there is a lot of that in very dry weather."
And there's a lot on the game.
Lavender oil is not only suitable for holidayers, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant nests with a large number of flowers, we have less, less developed and either lacking or weak.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions taken into account include a better distribution of water and the slowdown of pollution from the soil, but also the testing of plants with a protective mixture of ton and water and the development of species that are resistant to dryness.
The city of Geisa in the Thuring Rhön celebrates its 1200-year-old heritage.
The summit is this Saturday and Sunday with a mid-term festival.
Krämmer, zünts, dealers, vagantes or a farmer should be able to survive these days in the city.
Killing a journalist poses a growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce are normally in the middle of the evening to check their plans for reporting on the latest Chaos in Sinaloa State through organized crime, corrupt officials and unsolicited drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are going to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with granates in 2009, or let them go home.
Security experts wrote three words on a table on the front page of the room: opponent, neutral, connected.
They ask the rapporteur to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, enough facts and feelings.
There are drug dealers, politicians, business people, journalists who are suspected of being on the government budget list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who threaten Mexico's Chaos.
There is no break from violence, and as the bodies spread throughout the country, there are still more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and shootings under federal protection, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries in this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in a numerous books about violence in relation to drugs.
His shortcomings will be deeply detected, although his presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "justice" depends on the fascade of the Riodace building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, who show their casual face with glasses or their typical panamuth.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their alpine dreams, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special federal administration was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, this committee, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, has introduced only two criminal procedures.
As with most thousands of deaths associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are brought to court only rarely.
At Riodoce, they still have to deal with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are infuriated and although the earth is still more depleted.
Without information about the killer, without justice, the meeting has little benefit in discussing security, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all miss."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoc in the capital city of Culiacan.
He was only able to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corrolla was held by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelfth River".
The guard left his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two grown children.
I'm afraid I'm going to go back to Culiacan for free.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing like Sweden.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest fighting camps in the country, where rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't seem that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the peaceful court is full of broken, double walls for drug kings, which are larger than many homes for the living.
Remember for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug dealers in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodace, was guilty of not protecting his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
At first, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the revaliating cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have disappointed the sons, who were forced to buy each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to the newspaperskios.
The second error was not to force Valdez to do so, following the decision of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his execution is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues admitted that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Norway in 2003 when he sold himself with five colleagues to establish Riodoc and 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "when it is impossible to exercise journalism without putting it on the ransom problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper deserved a call because of the courageous and honest reporting and the use and advertising.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-to-read research without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else would ever treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoc, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot price" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, where he was always involved.
He volunteered to be afraid.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ drawing.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompevinto TV last October.
"They must take the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what happened before?"
The Riodoce team misss Valdez, the fun bird who could run like a port worker, the friend who was great-grandfather with hugs and kisses, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office and sit there on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his loss?
His death also forced her to ask her own opinions about how she could do her best and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're with their wives, their children, their clean business, their secret start and landways," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-interest and self-sustainment.
Trust his own instincts.
If it's wrong, stay away from it.
The judge is, the editor of the Riodace Andres Villarreal said that "by means of a sense that can be drowned ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - not exactly like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries where a toxic mix of luxurious weddings, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce's employees met for security training, no phones were immediately allowed. Days earlier it was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class area of Culiacan.
In the meantime, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police, whom the Governor himself did not trust.
It's been months since the reporters went to Bergland, where the drug gangs are under control.
For the issue this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julius Caesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state spending that focused on the home city of the Governor.
And there was a group that carried out a removal in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the government's office.
There was no official word about who was taken or how it happened, so it was warned when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew: that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Before long, several PRI Governors were charged with high-quality cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman encountered a military coup.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had looked at the columns of Valdez as the best known source of guidance.
"We've already known what happened before," said Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his beautiful body.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murder of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez cut off a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the government's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests, it was his.
All over the country, journalists have become stronger by signing down in organised protests "SOS Press" on weights and buildings.
On this day, Director Bojorquez is away from Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez charged the authorities with spying journalists and letting them in because they told the truth.
She prayed rather that she would be re-parted by the government because she was concerned that her village had damaged her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico have been "given" by organised crime, involving government officials and a similar society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that the reporter was not only killed by drug gangs, but also by order of politicians and security forces who were involved in organized crime under a cover.
The media growth group "Article 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials in the past year.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murders have an amazing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was reportedly signed by the Zetas cardell: "Here I am for my report."
A computer keyboard and headphones lie next to their detached head.
Some branches have chosen to conclude how the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the death of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do what El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed publicly to the drug cartel with a leading article on the title with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they're laughed, as shown by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City.
For those who stay back and continue to work, it is a daily dance with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who wanted to be the first person to be a drug dealer, said that the drug trade had robbed him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
About midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, in the editor of Riodoce on the city wall before the office and drink beer, when all her phones began to sum up.
A series of shootings with banden rivals and security forces near the Badeorte Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued, as it was promised through a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the board, they published the news on the website of Riodoce on the phone.
The timetables had to be changed the next day.
Sirens are near - another shot in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who kept the watch to see if they were available.
If they were afraid at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the powerful portrait of the famous founder of the newspaper, whose medallifier was visible throughout Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about it," Bojorquez said, "when the Javier was murdered on the same day, the practitioners asked me to send them to report to the street."
Dynosauri used drying to wash his enemies
On the first look it looks like a status, even an amazing one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian mountain worker's incredible nashor were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur".
It was so well received that they could even determine that his beautiful skin was red brown - and they said she had something of an "unseen past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the most well-founded dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosauri who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-perceived condition has inspired researchers who described it as a "real mark value"
According to reports in National Geographic, the planned plant freshener is the best fossil in its species.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millienum Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He encountered something that appeared missing from the surrounding stone, and decided to look more precisely at it.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years trying to discover the animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of hard clay.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be filled.
"If you were to blink just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was asleep," said Chief author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is to be seen.
"It will be included in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and the best of dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant freshener, although it is covered with a solution and looks like a changing panzer, is likely threatened by meat-staining dinosaurs.
The strongly-pained dinosaur used a red and white tanning to hide itself from predators, and used a screening technique known as resistance damage, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed better mixing in its environment and eliminating its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosauri family has made the first series in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Boraelopelta Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.
The amazing maintenance of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shoes and joints over his body.
They discovered the counter-chatting, an extended method of defense in the animal realm, which means that the peaks of the creature were darker than their subside.
Although contrasting is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Boraelopelta increases by far the size of living animals today.
It shows that the dinosaur has been driven by sufficient pressure by a meat-staining dinosaur that Evolution has benefited from the acceleration of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But the most contemporary animals that use the counter-chatting - you think of rowing, zebras or gortels - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bees, which signaled that this nodosauri was a real struggle for survival.
"Starkes Raubtier behaviour on a massive, strongly-pinned dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Creed Time must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their shells also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal’s life, including its preserved darmin content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was cast into a river and cast into the sea, where he died on the back to the bottom of the sea.
By this time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more country-wide than they are today.
"This nodosauri is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with a preserved leather but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today almost looks exactly like in the early credit period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it. If you just split a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's asleep."
The Creed time was a time, as a time of massive thermopods, flashing dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passing through the earth.
Although the king of them, who lived for millions of years after Boraelopelta, was the retired dinosaur by some of his outstanding practices.
The Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, consists of six tons of heavy monsters.
Scientists whose latest findings appeared in the journal Current Biology believe that Boraeopelta was mumified after death in the sea and in the mud.
The creation was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millieum Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's most well-kept dinosaur, including skin and rest, and is completely from the snow to the floor.
The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It included two 20-inch-long chips that were fired by his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the frozen plant freshener was frozen by the western Canada until a flood swept it into the open sea.
But the water supply of the dinosaurs kept its rest in exclusive detail.
The vast remnants of this special specimen are so well received that the skintrestens still cover half-pound plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic is such a level of maintenance as rarely as a profit in Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it will be.
The hidden remains of the skin still cover the tiny panzer plates that carry the damage of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are pressed up.
I can count the shoes on his shoe.
In the winter: mass carolage on A8: Many injuries
Hefty accident on Thursday at A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are developed in a mass car park.
There are a number of injuries, hundreds of miles away - and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-München highway (A8), about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass car park.
According to the police's first statement, at 17.00 hours between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichrich-Friedberg) connection points were broken down during a storm of nearly 30 vehicles, including probably also cargo cars.
At first, there were no data on the exact number of victims.
It's about slight to medium-term injuries, a police speaker said.
A large assembly of rescue vehicles was in the crash site.
The A8 direction was completely blocked.
In the direction of the München train, about ten miles [10 km] long backway was formed.
As an AZ-reporter reports, there have also been massive obstacles on the opposite side of the road - through numerous cases.
The firewall noted the signs of the vehicle chain that now have to be calculated with sensitive punishment.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a pkw.
A rescuer was on the way to an accident.
Deutsche Train: Group Test "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: Nothing in the night is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or one is deeply involved in his work and just has a wonderful thought.
And then: puff.
The chaffner comes and wakes up an unsound or reaches the passenger guest in the middle of the workshop.
Control of the road map.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Railway is currently testing the free drive maps.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and evaluate the road map.
A test operation is currently running on two tracks.
"The offer comes up, we extend it out.
It will then be expected to be available in many other areas of transport in Germany in the coming years," said a train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train's rating without a driver's license.
However, some conditions need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - whatever the majority of the passengers already do.
You also need to get it over the app of the train that has bought the DB Navigator, which is also the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And finally, you need a seating reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works as follows: You get up in the train, call your driver's card under "My Tickets".
In the case of test customers, a button appears for electronic design.
The train crews receive a notification on their mobile devices that the X driving gast is in the train and has taken the registered seat Y.
The trainer comes at Y's place to check that a passenger is sitting there with an already-assessed online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, you can work, you can move on.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - what to use the passengers again.
"If you want to travel without ticket control by our train crew, simply check in the DB Navigator.
This allows the passengers to make their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, a marketing representative of DB.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to go into the individual customer needs."
Those who travel often know that in addition to delay and missed trains, the driver's cards are among the greatest concerns.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the Mysteries does not have all the details that you need to review online tickets.
Either the credit card or the personal form or another document you need to present is missing.
The consequences are endless discussions between trainers and passengers, leading to a bad vote in the section or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket, and the shipowner takes time to take care of other cases.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And it is also only on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stutgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-food.
Other train numbers on the same track are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot down to her neck.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, in St. Louis, where she was born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and clogged by Facebook on her phone.
She was proud of a post by someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said.
Unfortunately, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed her Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the hand @TheePharoh has always been quoted on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., alive to second.
He posted a picture of Brown's lebulous body on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left her phone to go back to tweets later tonight about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Browns' father, who took a picture with the inscription: "Fergus's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live-feed where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a strange dog.
In another video, she said, she found another cop's threat, and she said, "I'm going to... kill all the animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we used to call us typical."
At this point, I felt a shock.
I was angry and angry."
She bought a return trip and went home the next day.
After the landing about 23 hours, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the Chinese since 11.
It is a story of survival and the protest, love and loss, the strength and resistance of the people who have lived in the Community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As a Ferrrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning “on the black experience and the black condition”.
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for it, where they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't bring her," said Ferrell later.
"What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
You need to know it and see it and get caught up in it.
It must be well developed, not only activity and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the joy of giving you an experience in which she personally does not experience an exciting racism, she is no different than the next black woman's child.
I have the feeling that I would show you a bad service to keep them away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place against the police authorities, which became a camp area, when the activists were waiting for the possible charges of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter associated themselves with a local businessman who made dinners.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
A new type of activity for Ferrell began to be adopted in the long run.
"My activity has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food injustice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all here."
Weeks later, Ferrell met during a evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-regists of the film.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This creature was caused by numerous cases of human beings, often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not focus their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-regist Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activity around death extracts.
His engagement brought Ferrrell closer to the project, along with six other natives, the team followed "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's creation.
"This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because I'm going to be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it was "not to be a Messianic leader, but to a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the openest participant in the film.
Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" show amazing personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she loves herself and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some harm in this work and in the manipulation of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history continues to play the role of black-educated women in the wider black-lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three reasons for the movement that followed the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 were identified as a school in the "BlacklivesMatter" film in social media.
"Black, weak women in leadership positions have brought the movement together," said Ferrrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, weak women must bear the load of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement will really be maintained by black women and many black women".
It is, however, that "this is no confirmatory type of action", in the Ferrall because of its identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who raised this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was on the front front, because in a life at these crossings there is so much on the game as a black, soft woman.
You can save their energy through the screen."
The news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on award for 211⁄2 years due to the blockade of a car at a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".
However, she cries out to a song and she feels obliged to remember this, since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Trium" to "Size House": TV reader discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center in the south of the footing zone has spread to the population since the first presentation in 2009 in favour of and against.
Kalt doesn't have a subject.
The theme will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg".
While they say to a bit gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), it comes from the other side: "No man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite bad: "Great car!" (Lars Scholz).
While the sponsors build that a gallery has more customers in the city, which also benefits the other businesses, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone will collapse.
In addition, the gallery is located on the ground floor, where the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded.
The Galerie Makers want to integrate a market hall into the Neubau - and to the Beda Square with the opportunity to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We've been buying for many years almost weekly in the farm market.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious kitchens of the rural women are still very much in love.
We've also discovered the match ranges for us.
We would like to have the opportunity to receive this offer directly during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, that is also true.
In particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers are staying in a market hall in the gallery, the height of the rental is up.
The new project, however, should not be just low."
Eva Kilic: "Wozu shopping in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find the excess.
There's already enough of this in our city.
However, you can see how many cargo shops are empty here - some months and years ago.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is so important that at least we still get the market hall.
Because the product offered there is always fresh, most of it is offered directly by the manufacturer and is highly priced.
As you can see, cargo shops in a shopping center will only be rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not affordable for a retailer.
Unfortunately, there's almost no more special business and what's left of it will probably be gone."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farm market halls go during the construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time, if the bit-galerie ever actually comes.
Or has it already been created to distribute all business from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "It's just not going to work.
And a shopping center, which is empty, doesn't need anyone either.
My view would have been better to promote a fair agricultural market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, there are many thanks to the huge many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer.
When the farm market hall is caught, a piece of culture will be eliminated again."
An appropriate similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA
In the middle of the room of Friedman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost identical - depending on cables from the deck.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wagen-Tupfern and haircuts that she was sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the prisoners out of Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst was sentenced to a 35-year prison sentence after making them publicly known as secret diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable match).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfrau and dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was changed only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from 30 portraits, how someone could look at these genetic data, even though there is some intellectual comment not only on the structure of DNA data - the many ways to interpret them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but since her Pubertätt has spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 complaints, including six complaints against spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Because of the prison, her picture was underlined, so much so that there was only one photo - a cool, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is obviously sitting on a driver seat and wearing a platinum-colored pearls - with which she was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 'Stranger Visions' project.
In it, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artifacts such as cigarettes and kaugumi by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press review of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA device.
The artists and their acquired museums were inseparable fellows who wrote several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" that predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and they would be able to see the exhibition personally.
In fact, only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release would be required after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, a kind of happy assembly.
There are also some deeps and stars at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war on informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, two-way ways to further expand the bigger columns that he really should control.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the rare timing of all these things, she said "It's happening for a certain reason".
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked for its greatest signature (the "i" in her family name is seen with a heart) the end of "automatic dispersion which has been based on sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in bleistif, a thousands of sensors of Cs and Gs and As.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by involving 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take from it is that our reputation is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," Dewey Hagborg said, whose 2007 video work is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so 30 of these stories are. "
The last item in the exhibition, stored in a private room, is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
It shows Manning how she appeared with a free phone in her hand from the United States disciplinary cassettes like King.
"If they call you, then they have won," it says.
"So never stop the mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who cried out from Philadelphia.
"I'm still going to have sex when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it has been predicted in the Comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genome simulations, which combine themselves as a host of Protestants.
This was also targeted, as was all in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning’s statue), where their genetic haplo groups were written with bleisty.
"In the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a lot of people," said Dewey Hagborg from the portrait.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University for murder
A country-wide humanejagd is a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is suspected of being shot in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the acts of the Cook County court.
The documents say Cornell-Durranleau, 26, died after several strokes.
A community warning system published by the Chicago police authorities that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still in the place of the event for a long time, and detectives were investigating the strengths as murder, while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, the officers said.
Lathem has been an outstanding professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now allowed and was excluded from the participation of the Campus of the Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasure Assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail statement, a speech by the University and Somerville College said that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US intelligence authorities in any way you think."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he would insist that the suspects be put to the authorities.
"The police have a picture of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthened," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities helped to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a straight-up tip, who claimed there was something going on in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very nice.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working at the time and background of the victim and researching a number of motives, including a possible domestic event."
"We will conclude the WADA train plan in the near future" - the Russian visa Premier Mutko
The Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the road plan, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA train plan was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA road plan on compliance with the code that described the criteria for the re-installation of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, he doesn't have anything that could give Russia an opportunity to care.
"All has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian Lawyer Richard McLaren on State-enforced Doping in Russian sports.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has encountered an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we're not going to give something that doesn't exist."
Mutkos' words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In a discussion with the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, adding: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains conflicting positions and regulations.
No one is willing to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 during the Doping scandal by the WADA from the implementation of Doping Controls in Russia.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA moves "in the right direction" to be used again.
No more self-sales before
This was shared by the corporate groups.
It was a purely precautionary measure, which could continue to be excluded from any health threat, and it was contained in the Communication.
From now on only eggs should be supplied to Aldi, which are likely to have been tested negatively on fipronyl-containing anti-sulphurs.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency in his customers.
The start ups that will help your company not become the next uber
Amy Errett wanted your employees to measure the happiness of your e-commerce start-up, but the questions didn't work.
The answers were often vague, rather helpful or even worse - negative.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers do not fail the process.
"It was simply never consistent and objective," said Erret, the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
She called people out for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it enables companies to carry out questions, to address specific groups and demographic groups, to provide employees with anonymous and complaint hotlines, and in some cases to allow them to convert C-Sute to leadership forces and directly to the Governing Council.
"They now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software Analytics tools are used to measure employees' commitment.
Erret said she had a better perspective on what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap questionnaires and questionnaires of certain teams, it offers a hit-card of the company which shows a view which units have most complaints and which management forces have low approval results - so that you can explain why.
Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not become the next crop developed in scandal, since an ex-employer has published a blog post describing an area of harassment in which those who spoke have been punished.
For start-ups like glint, this desire is, after a glance, a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Converter, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a growing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the Uber fall in miscredit.
Konvertent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Konvertent allows companies to send targeted "pouls-" queries, collect reliable answers in real time, and see the heat maps of your problems.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints will go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has found the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and manager of Converter.
If a company is found to be ill-treated or treated by its employees, it can experience cost-effective consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Converter for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their business centre.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company's central office, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an insult and inconceivable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, as the company uses Convertent, problems that may have been identified and addressed before the leadership forces in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfavourable practices - can be identified and discussed.
"I can get closer to this whole, 360 degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment legal conflicts."
As soon as companies began to take on the role of ethics, values and employees in 2002, after the bookkeeping firm Arthur Andersen compiled for ethical damage by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it lasted until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty washing went online.
"To use technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Converter offer your software as a service, and the companies charge reimbursable fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both started ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, with the total capital increased to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November of Bestemer Venture Partners and contributed his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complexity of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high levels of content and interesting projects are only used.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, they feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is rewarded, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Converter and Glint.
Employees achieve income when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are employed and engaged.
If the Analytics tools third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees, it is not surprising that you find support.
The data on the employee's commitment is important after the experts of the workplace culture.
However, the data are used when no action is taken by the administrator of a company.
In fact, if a company asks its employees for your feedback, it may be expected that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can search for surprises and demobilize employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 orders, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, the company that has seen too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow the employees ask, "Have you really heard me?
Are you worried about that?
And who don't you worry about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff questions, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so correct.
And after the collection of feedback from frustrated staff, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to deal with the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it is hoped that in the long term, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you lose companies.
The NCAA ends the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes to 23 hours when a number of UCLA football players are held on one side of the new team training field on the campus.
Some have removed their tricotober parts and show their backs full of Switzerland from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team these inactive minutes are an afternoon break.
Players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their finals after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"That's for the boys the next three days a real thrill," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday of the day.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the player's load, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the end of the day.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19:15 in order to correct the already filled schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruines moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the first six games in Westwood.
They are supposed to stop at the end of August 18 exercises. 20 before the start of the formal game preparation for their attack against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported NCAA's policy change even if it added another point to the multi-employed route of the player.
"We lay this enormous burden on her for three or four days, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they've just printed it, they're going to pick themselves up, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear lines of its field of view from a adjacent park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the above-mentioned class, which has already been surrounded with football, which will not be an easy task in the face of an underground network.
Bruins players are supposed to be staying at the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We're going to use our security," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not too late to think that the people there are renting a room and then setting themselves up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video band of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on the parking lot 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I don't care much about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify the verification of facts in the fight against bad news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact-checkers of third parties and then show their results under the original contribution, the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is a effort to fight the so-called Face News.
The company said in a view on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false statements and to send them to verifiers of fact, which may show the results of the fact-finding from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for the so-called Fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where French voters have been transferred to the presidential elections in May with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they do not succeed in eliminating hot-rolling posts such as before the elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement to Germany that a test of the new facts will be started in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge that the stories of fact-finding third parties are perceived, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "linked article" and work on other changes in its message feed to reduce misinformation.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his younger years, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Scottish music video and was a club dance for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived for 700 years as a sad story of his comfortable seat in Bewl River Tal in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaar Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who's been up to 300 years," he says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the time of Edward, and documents the families who lived in Scotland. Every story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Ded Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I have only responded to the impression on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jakob," he says.
"It's his toothbrush!
And letters always flow to smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lived 300 years later, the noise has an effect as if he were himself.
Oh, I love Archive!"
For someone who has been hit with such old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and has lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have a little overestimated my wishes") this seems to be too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days investigating the Victorian "new" lock to view the archive and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the lock, such as the mounted hyena caps on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in graveyards.
He traveled through the land and the ruins of the old city and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes entered a decade later, the employees just started to care for the archive, which he described as "hundred of years in which aristocracy said "Oh, if it were on the roofs."
Daily books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps, which show who said, "I could think that civil conflicts would be long-term," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.
Boy, let's get everything out of his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to exchange on a wider basis in English history, including 'The Laborer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the construction stage of 1381.
"There is a record of an upturn, which appears in the lock, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The construction phase began in this area and I thought that a stand was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patriarch who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the Schmugler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, who focused his own comparison by filling a sarge with stones (a discovery that was made one year later when his sarge was excavated).
The Darrells are the Rhodes'Lovelings family of Scotney: "The Lords seem to be a great fan, always make mistakes and spend money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying many old women - I think they're a dog that looks like a good guy, with a talent to buy a marriage."
After the end of its use in the lock, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish Wildness for a comic novel about Eljanmäki, the land of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was asked by either nature again.
But Scotty has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish my fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marien capelle in Rhöndorf
With the cancellation of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roofmark (runsview of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team will keep the logo and the slogan secret about Nelson Artz.
At the end of August, it should be given a stop on the island of Graphenworth as a high point of the campaign.
"You'll be nice to us.
Or?" the actors of the action have asked since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We think that (of course!) is not true," they write on their yesterday-release website.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
On the basis of this, we are firmly convinced that we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city as Bad Honnefer citizens."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is appropriate to form an exclusive promise, one that the city has an irreplaceable unique feature."
Finally, they are in competition with other communities.
A mid-fifth amount is allowed to cost the town Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year, August begins in Ankara of the Upper Military Rate (YAS) about pensions and transfers in the official body.
So is this week.
A normal process at first glance.
But nothing is routine for the Turkish combat forces one year after the bombing.
The meeting was no longer in the building of the General Assembly as it was before, but at the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Presidents as well as the Minister for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
That's why the civilians in the YAS were in the surplus.
The government's taking the train in the military.
General Staff, Hulusi Akar, remained in the office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Marine were removed.
Since the split summit, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirés.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to the alleged connections to move the exil-predistant Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan as the driver of the potschvswich.
Against 486 persons who should have been directly involved in the Putschvrecht test this week will be treated in Ankara.
The day after the Putsch, Erdogan had referred to the conversion test as "good gift", since he had given him the opportunity to "cleanse the battle forces completely".
But Erdogan really has the army in the grip?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the title "Unaccompanied in the Military Capital".
In general, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the head tax ban for soldiers.
The major cleansing of the army and the security forces continues anyway.
In mid-July Erdogan, by decree, fired 7395 state servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had captured the military.
The generals looked earlier than the real rulers of the country.
Three times they pointed to their role as guardian of the World State Order.
Following its 2002 election, Erdogan stressed the power of the military to step, not least in line with the reform objectives of the European Union.
Former officials say Erdogan's triumph is aimed at the Islamization of the fighting forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, a nameless officer who, after the Putschschvörszet, sought out persecution in the country of Asyl, the Turkish army will be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that were to happen, such a development could not make Nato cold.
On the other hand, there are doubts about the use of the Turkish army in the Alliance.
The guiding structures and operational skills are "weak", say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for receiving visas for a reduced working permit and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two Chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States changes the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will welcome the candidates who speak English, who have financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will be granted," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to fix tracks for racing shots
It has always been disputed over the future of the race catch in the past months - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is to be built on the maraude street on which the tourist road runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the railway shuttle, construction work should be started on the road, as indicated by the Ministry of Transport in this year.
"With the decision to continue to order and heal the street Ilmenau race, the country is known for this important connection to tourism," said the State Secretary of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of setting up the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country took 75 per cent.
The contract, which is to be ordered on this basis also in the future of the country, will now be finally agreed, declared.
The Ministry and the Southern Railways are already familiar with the technical details.
"This is why the vehicle used and quality standards are used," said Seoul.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
This means that the Runnsteig-Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rrennsteig-shuttle is a popular railway link between the Ilmenau and Rrensteig railway station.
In the past months, a pilot operation has been tested whether the route of many people is used to order them again in the future.
The track is also highly reliable in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry.
Well, if you think it can't be made worse in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming up.
Yeah, really.
Sex robots are now a big thing.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artistic intelligence at the University of Sheffield and FRR's co-founders, we must begin to take seriously their rise.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest wall and the type of finger needle.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver every amount of it, and we will be able to see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Modern sex pumps have developed from their flashy partners to robots with a siliconhout that feels hot - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the brush to the type or color of his fingernail.
But it will be even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would progressively make a Stepford-Fraud look.
Modern sex pumps have developed into robots with a silicone.
The RealBotix Robots enables, for example, its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find challenging, such as protection.
And then there are also the Roxxxy Gold-Roxxy robots developed by True Company with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which communicates the impression of protection and "Wild Wendy" with a "advanced" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible adapted to your personality," the website of True Company reports.
She likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her voices during the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she may be "in a vote"!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise in sex robots - not the last, because they replace real human relationships - but the underprivileged female qualities, the games of violence, when one steps towards freerid (hereafter: anti-smokering) Farrah, one of the most.
On his website, True Company Roxxzy compares to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a Roxxhy?" it is on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex game.
Their appearance and their increasing refining reflect on something darker and deeper in our culture, a return from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional assignment.
Most men will naturally not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain at the edge of consumer culture for a long time.
But what's safe from the ranges can be very learned about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not rare or boring until the free market permits them to do so.
However, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president who has spoken to them to have sex with women.
The most striking aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic images, the broken bodies and the eyes that are blinded, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a spring, but it does not feel like a great spring.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar ratios).
Her builder wants her to feel human, to take the movement of a real body.
But, brought to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots don't show real women.
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave.
They have no intelligence or background history, nothing that indicates independence or something that could disrupt the imagination of total subversion.
Other expressed: They are lovely slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 conversation: Services
Tromps big performance?
He makes Mitt Romney into a healthy human mind
It has become a bilingual knowledge of the trup era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. elections have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Easter, there were newspapers in the United States about how to deal with the horror of Trump.
We're all going to force us all to place our filter bubbles.
Less notice is taken of the power of Trumps, bringing families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, has visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relations she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely on the same side.
It is certainly a good thing to eat about the table, but it seems to me in another context that this also poses serious risks.
The link was strengthened by Trump, but the decisive effect of his presidency has the power to send us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the enormous possibility that we will no longer be deprived of the tastes of a day.
However, there is a more alarming long-term scenario in the Republicans of the right wing "normalised", which appears at once in comparison with its standards as a matter of compatibility.
Today I find myself recommending an active nostalgia for mid-Romany urcomic version of the crazy one - the dog on the car roof, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew how to make his tax declaration) - both of them are in fact a very mild punishment compared to Trump.
In the case of Trump, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy only in order to qualify as an indispensable improvement.
As my cousins were in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in the Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York parking lot, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are huge, the Fiberlas design on the central cylinder - all clowns are brief and the animals are busy looking at their own shoulders - especially windows and air-conditioning music convey this in a remarkable way.
So many clicks of a city: The views of high buildings will be old, the Skylines will be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not justify the dream.
Fifty years later, and I am still not quite sure about the day when I discovered that Swiss cottage in fact is not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Old Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large circle traffic in north London.
However, the Central Park Karussell is still a rare magical experience, since here two years old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go to it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full number, but luckily no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was forced into a shopping house to assess my " Experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the evaluation with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the cargo.
This leads not only to a delay of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also to pressure the server to introduce personality in a situation where there is no need for it.
The poor woman in the shopping house was enormously glaring, while I had the experience to reach her credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison in the hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit the second time.
In the past year, he was brought into the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hands, which followed the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced to death after an appeal by the state prosecutor against a first death sentence.
He killed Steinkamp in the early mornings of the Valentine's day in 2013 by kicking her through a bathroom door in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he held his friend for a night's funeral, who hid himself in the cabin.
The state officials have announced their intention this time to bring against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, from which they say they are too careful.
The national prosecution authority said that it would appeal at the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard in this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased for 15 years if the state prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a remarkable egg
As the last of the Bloomberg Schools, the four-class clubs from Fütten and Epfenhofen were released in the holidays and in the continuing schools.
Three of the graduates will go to Gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
Schoolmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the mayor's house Biessental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of the school's position, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Smucher and Queen Meder, chose a young adult who grows up in the hospital, but will then be released to freedom.
In addition, the Mount Schar introduced a musical titled "The Adler in the Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a remarkable egg, and he let it go from his knees.
Instead of a hive, a little Adler came out.
But the hope of making a nest out of him ran away, and the Adler spread his wings on a high mountain.
The classes then showed three and four in the Yvonne Frank's study a stage dance.
The Hens danced with the young gockles who wear cylinders for the law.
The Adler stands for integration, said the schoolmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal, however, is different from the other young animals (kikens), but it belongs to them.
But he won't be like a hook.
His determination is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in her new school.
It followed the words of thanks to the colleagues, former schoolmaster Michael Müller, who is constantly taking the lead in teaching failure and parental representatives.
The kitchen time is now over, declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She left her students after two years of education very young, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they have been able to leave themselves on the fourth floor.
To conclude, all students will be allowed to celebrate a song of summer and holiday time.
It brought great joy to the children.
For the new school year, eight first-classers have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested because of illegal campsites in Greece, shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by the television.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal foreigners was established in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released, while an investigation was under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have strong control over the free Campen and have imposed considerable financial penalties on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could delay a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should diesel drivers be involved in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
In Diesel Gippel, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group offered software updates for all of 5.3 million cars.
They are expected to improve the performance of cars of the Emission Class Euro 5 and, in part, Euro 6.
Euro-4 pieces or worse are excluded from this.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe offers estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the processed software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates first apply only to vehicles that have spam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their refurbishment has been organised by the KBA.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a slow implementation in the coming months, but no specific deadline has yet been mentioned.
Daimler has notified each person concerned.
If an inspection is not valid, it will be carried out within its scope.
How long should all the equipment be removed?
"It's hard to say," means Smetanin.
This depends on the manufacturer's commitment to both political pressure.
"Because we have seen the car manufacturers act voluntarily on the topic of the environment not long ago."
How long should the update last?
The equipment itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more timer to get a term.
What are car drivers doing who don't drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?
The ACE is ready to wait.
It is possible that foreign producers would be attracted to Smetanin.
Is there now a massive drop in prices from Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But even in the regions where traffic bans take place.
There is no loss of value for older Diesel in the rural area so far.
The ACE is ready to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center drawing
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump is promised to become political.
One of the priests doesn't want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is one of the popular drawings of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural establishment was announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The nominations will be passed in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will receive an invitation and share with his wife, Melania.
The prestigious Lear, known with progressive TV series, had already announced to refuse to participate in the Gala.
The New York Times said: "This Presidency has decided to completely undermine the art and human rights - even withdrawing the funds - and that imposes me."
The 59-year-old Stefan stressed that she would use the talk with Trump to clarify her views.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural establishment in the US capital.
The former priests are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs City Building Master, goes to Rente next year.
However, the position has already been issued - suitable competitors are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work continues to make him very happy, as it is announced in the press talk.
He reports about varied but also demanding tasks that are expected of his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that he has not fulfilled the requirement profile until no application has been made.
The city is looking for a architect or construction engineer at the next possible time.
This should be, in view of the regular termination periods, still enough time for an operation.
Since Haslach serves as a lower construction authority for the administrative community, the tenderer must provide the relevant conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city at all times.
If they could no longer meet these requirements, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg to consult.
But the city is close to the city and it is important to it, says Wacker, who is reported by a good business climate and a good voice between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years at the office, some important projects have been collected, looking back at the Wacker with steel.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building and its employees.
But in the future, there will also be a variety of projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the underground park have been completed.
The King's bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach will be renewed, and the seasonalization is still the theme.
Only the last one will be hit with about 1.5 million euros in cash, "if we do it right", Wacker appreciates it.
"All of them are waiting for great tasks on my followers.
The work here is fun."
For a city builder there is a large playroom.
With Haslach's own building and garden could be reacted to quite flexiblely.
"Man can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city stands as an assembly of memorial protection, it is important to have "one eye for what is clean" when new buildings are approved, the various city builders stress.
In addition, the city-builders have a high responsibility.
He's a farmer, "At last everything runs over my table."
He can count on long-term staff: Markus Neuauier (highbuilding) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (tiefbau) for 15 years.
Even if his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good business environment but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to acquire Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed study in the city of Haslach as a diplomat or Bachelor with news architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction law.
The city building consists of high- and heavy construction, construction planning, basic business matters, management of the city's property, the city's office with building and city administrations, as well as under construction law, including memory protection.
Trained on instructions: South road block
According to the police, the unknown workers had turned the blue train from the railway to the directions in the Leobener Street area (B116).
They were so badly damaged that they needed to be kept in good condition.
The investigators go out of two men and look for them at night hours.
Close to the tatort, Witnesses had been observed a rosary roller and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a noisebubbing stream," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrators had taken great risks and had also been in danger of traffic.
In addition to the damage to the lock and the installation, as well as the missed minutes and the cost of rail transport, train customers could also be able to access the doors.
Totally be out of a "great" sum, the speaker said.
The damages were again needed on Friday afternoon, which could be driven by road on the south road without obstacles.
Nearly ten people were missing on Friday morning, two of which dealt with transport.
They don't look good, but they have forgotten.
According to ÖBB speakers Christoph Posch had to be replaced by about 200 meters of overruns.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (Energy Disorders)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like an alpine.
But a new study strongly supports the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could reduce the symptoms of patients with emotional pain.
The unhappy state that affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach attacks and blasts, repeated or bloody accidents, weight loss, and extreme anxiety.
While the subjects are normally designed to measure meat and milk products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that essential amino acids contribute to the development of immunosuppression of proteins that promote a tolerance of Darm.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the dark to ensure that harmful microorganisms that hide themselves in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of eliminating ignitions will be equal to cells that promote tolerance and protect the body from harming the body without sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too much in the direction of dehydration, this can result in an intestinal disorder.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance promotes immunity in mice that carry a particular bacteria into their tissues.
And the bacteria need Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to solve the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuter - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had these immunities."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuter and a rich food at Tryptophan encourage a more tolerant, less sensitive dry oil if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune system that promoted tolerance when she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strains, which had been submitted separately, did not.
She was convinced that the difference between the darmrobioms of the museum - the community of bacteria, viruses and Pilzens, who normally live in the magen-darms.
The walls of the museum were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that existed in the museums with the Immunes, but they were not missing in the museums.
Mouses were taken into a sterile environment, so they lacked a darm microbiom and did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. Reuters and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuters grew in a fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without the bacteria - to countless immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance cells.
When the active components have been purified from fluid, it is proven to be a product of tropical metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid.
If the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the mouth of the museum, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were half, the number of cells around half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerance cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuters protect in our magen-darms.
It is not known whether triptophan nebula products from L. reuter developed cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan have been found in humans with intestinal intestinal disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, as these cells control emissions on the internal surface of the dragon.
Potentially, high triptophans in the presence of L. reuter can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Macic has committed a "genie"
At Manchester United has signed a "genie" with Nemanja Macic, Joseph Mourinho believes, after the middle-aged player had his debut against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-session game, before the UEFA Super Cup began against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and was impressed by the role of the stander, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira have shown their love.
Matt, however, was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and only created 45 minutes, which Mourinho said he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be prepared before he is later."
In addition to Macic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, where Mourinho formed his starting-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent insisted this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already had a "funtastic work" to meet three of its four leading new commitments.
"Three of four, I thank the union for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four of four for me, but they've given me great pleasure."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in Heaven
The U.S. Air Force manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in heaven.
The pilots flew from Seattle to Washington, U.S. state, but the drawing started in March, Michigan, U.S. State, and came in the form of a dreamliner over the United States, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screen was to be the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was an extension for new engines.
Boeing had already made such a statement before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were added to the sky.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
However, as the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD, the social democratic presidents always looked at the elections with a certain concern to Berlin.
Not only did no fires from the party center, but only no wind from the feds - thus voiced the most important wish of the electors.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed substantially.
Since then, workers from the Willy Brandt House have seen the events in the SPD-led capitals.
What has been learned from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the form of wind.
It was deep-fashioned.
And one after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once more: Red Green can't just manage confidently," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the Edit Network of Germany (GND).
The surprising turnout of a Green Group has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a severe crisis.
Five months before the country's election, its red-green coalition was lost to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federation leader Michael Kellner called on the newly formed Dutch Green Group to withdraw its mandate.
The transition to CDU means a clear reconciliation of the electoral will.
Each tweet must return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Business Leader and Greens' Elections leader to the Editing Network of Germany (GND).
"But this can't be true," says a SPD elector, when the new hiob message reaches the party centre on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is following the transfer of the Green Chamber to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional height of a whole range of major and small crises in SPD-country relations.
And no one knows what happens next.
The measurements began with the unexpected significant decline in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the genoses were resting in his time.
After the day-to-day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
This also became - and although everything was clearly worse.
The underground in Kiel brought the SPD into the tammel, the Düsseldorf-Pletheat haze around the party.
The genoses again came back in the week.
Then, when they had just created a new mut, the G-20-Gible of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next depth.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Head, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he entered Elbphilharmony while burning his city.
And because he made almost everything wrong in crisis communication.
Since then, Scholz has fought for his political survival.
So now, too, Stephan Weil.
The Dutch Prime Minister has been in the crisis for a long time because of the VW-Agassaffaire and its role in the Supervisory Board.
Miss Refried came in.
Despite this, or perhaps just because, during the past few weeks, we have always tried to put more emphasis on the federal accents.
The intention of the former mayor of Hannover to build his power in Berlin was also not hidden by genoses in Martin Schulz's area.
They gave him a guarantee because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
This is because there is no guilt on the part of the Dutch Greens, on the ground.
And I don't know yet.
Instinctively, the genoses strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Your throne is on the greens, and above all, on the newly formed Parliamentary Council of Twesten.
"It is inexhaustible and democratically damaging, as Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests into the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Partnerships in the SPD Bundestags Group, the Editation Network Germany (GND).
Mrs Twesten is not elected as a direct candidate for her person, but on the list of Dutch reasons in Parliament, so the Dutch delegation continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Bundestags Group, condemned an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The electoral will was clear four years ago: The people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who led the Dutch SPD as a top candidate in the Federal Day election, the RND.
"Now, the personal career memory of a future CDU coordinator is the result of the election," said Oppermann.
He asked to clarify the grounds.
I want to know if there has been more or has given further statements from the CDU Downloadercassen.
Loans for local residents III
Those who want to heal their home in the years to come can first receive support from the country.
In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development were informed on Wednesday in empathy.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again took a look at the incident.
Since 1991 it has been in sensitive sanitation areas.
At the time, the Baden-Württemberg country had received two thirds of the aid amount from the Sanctions region from 1991 to 2004.
In the area of sanitation, between 2005 and 2016, the increase was still 60 per cent.
For Schindler, previous heals are a "follow-up project" - whether it is important to promote internal development, and not just to create new areas of construction.
On April 4, Karlsruhe received information from the government Bureau that a sanitation area III will be provided.
The aid amount was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 came from the country remaining in the Community.
How does a sanitation area come into existence?
You will continue to explore where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in improving the health of interest in the planned area.
If so, the area boundaries could then also be changed.
The STEG is represented by middle-aged Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the "Social City" federal programme, which would then carry out the sanitation.
The programme is based on the revitalisation of cities, improving housing and employment relations and the acquisition and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be designed to be carried out in principle.
Finally, the Sanctions Area would be established as a settlement.
The authorisation period for the aid shall continue until 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year would be carried out only once, in the framework of those involved in the Sanctions Area, a questionnaire would be completed.
In November or December, the legislative decision should be taken as soon as possible in order to begin with the Sanctions in the coming year.
Pietzschmann further stated that each municipality had to carry out the investigation of the affected preabs.
It is important to assess and decide when to be cured and to what extent to evaluate the urban mismanages.
It will then also include a Sanctions Note in the Basic Book for the specific basic item.
Pietzschmann will come to feel again and make a picture of the situation, she promises.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
Therefore, it will be asked questions that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed until the end of the summer months.
The yellow question book is the "Building and basic building books", which involves, inter alia, the construction condition and the healing views.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Home and Housing Book", details can be made of the size, distribution and housing of a living room.
The blue "workbooks" is to be completed only if business spaces are operated in the building.
However, it is worth noting that a full questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, neo-baum measures will not be feasible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the aid is functioning according to the "windung principle" - who comes first, deserves first.
You can't save any promotion money for later.
To conclude, still photos of the project "Smack II" were shown to make the attendees a "smack kraft".
British discoverer sets itself a microchip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his house, take his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northham, 33, had planted the winning chip between women and showfinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hunts, to ensure that implant procedures are carried out according to medical standards.
The technology looks like a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northham also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built at home as well as at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on taxes.
The advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of taxpayers
The decision of the White House to fly a Marine Headhunter to South Lawn for an event that promotes American production in the last month costs taxes according to the military's data that were left at the time of the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000.
The green white Sikersky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the leading officials of the White House made a round of products from all 50 countries.
The Hubschruber made in Connecticut was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a baseball player from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the presence of the Hubscher in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, nearly 36 hours before the Huschers on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the Huschers.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote HMX-1 in front of the event of his predecessor, the deputy marine commander for air travel.
The news showed that the hijacker arrived at the South Lawn on July 17, at 7 a.m. for the event about 15 hours, and so long until the race was settled between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that, if the departure from the white house should be delayed, a second man would be required for return flight due to the limitation of hours of service.
The original flight crew was in the event of the hijacker, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the flight.
The records provided for by the TIME were not clear as to whether a second flight crew was needed at the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could damage the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was called by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
However, official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President urged the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate and promoted efforts to reduce government rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political advantages is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But to require their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted a survey in February when the presidential aircraft completed its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that his predecessors complained about the use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is inspired by the show "Made in America" - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to accommodate US Presidents in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump began July on the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 training lands in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" was counted as necessary for the training of the flight crew for the month, said an officer.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for non-presidential support missions.
The White House said the taxpayer took over the burden for none of the other requirements set out on the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in setting up the Hubschruger on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not contain budget allocations for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to identify the exact costs for the event.
According to the U.S. Department of Budgets for the financial year 2017, however, the DOD compensation rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the Hubschruber are far below this Council.
"The cost of taxable persons on the basis of the valuations for the refund rates is extremely disproportionate," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the compensation rules for DoD do not include the personal costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract closure.
At this time the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the Hubschruber for the event.
"The idea is to present this week's stuff that will be produced in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal Republic of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security, and I believe that hundreds of thousands of people do not even depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the hijackers and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked unfathomablely.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the Hubschruber when he was running over the South Lawn for the event, but he was sitting in the driver's seat of a firefight.
In the White House, Trup spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and complained with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikersky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW News for funerary tasks
The second Tennis-Bundesliga is the top leader at the top of the table, seekingdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will arrive at Kiel from 11 a.m. at the tableside of the SV.
Despite five parties still unable to balance the two Tennis Bundesliga, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the enemy anyway.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a similar format.
Right on the back positions I find the man very well."
For class and stability at the SV search villages, imports from the high north are mainly concerned.
"They can even refer to applications in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a look at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen, and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's always going to be hard for us.
You also need a good portion of happiness."
The new crew for the trip in the high north is practical.
His Debt for Blue-White could give Maxime Janvier.
If it is not possible to create the current in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella active Françoise to the Bundesliga party, the first use of Zdenek Kolar (Tschechian) in this season is made by the tournament in the Czech Liberec.
The previously unaccompanied Chilean Hans Podlipnik Castle was with the white rose Andrei Vasilevski last night at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the Ball.
But he should also be in Kiel, like Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julian Cagnina.
After his two winnings last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
In addition to the 18-year-old Hungarians, who were still one of the Junior World Rankers in January 2016, no one from the trainers' table around Marius Zay is filling the cadre.
How to damage the U.S.
Indeed, Donald Trump was not truly happy when he laid down his signature under the law for annulment of the sanctions against Russia.
"In his attempt to legislate the law," the Congress has packed a few "constitutional provisions" in it, he quoted.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and Brussels itself seemed to be against the US front.
However, the draft aims to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines in the EU.
Accordingly, several investors of the domestic OMV, together with other European companies, are encouraged to finance the construction of the Russian North Stream 2 North.
The drugs are violent.
However, if it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, then the official status of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to develop the sanctions for life through executive orders.
Twelve guns are his choice.
"The press" has looked at what the companies might differ and what might really be wrong with it.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be turned into the centre of Netflix.
Despite the second stage of Narcos, which involves Pablo Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is not yet over.
The stacks were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest worst sights of the show.
With the third stage, the DEA focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trade: the Cali cartel.
Introduced by four powerful patents, they operate "as a Fortune-500-enterprises" only with more state regulations and acts of violence.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is the official Mexican link, and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that the American and Colombian penal authorities call for to support the war against drugs.
More new players are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third stage of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role Left: The city offers 46 kitchen help
The city reorganizes the Kitai-Mittagstic itself.
With firm contact partners for the children and an appointment to the team.
The hour will be returned to the city's children's meetings.
As of September 1, the city of Krefeld again takes over the food supply in the urban children's day institutions (Kits) in ownership.
For Sonja Pommeranz, a leading young assistant leader, this is a good news: "We've all been very happy."
Cooking is still outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and provides freshly cooked meals.
The city operates 46 children's beds in the Kröfelder area, in 44 the children receive a warm meal at noontime.
In the past year, every 2800 children were on the table, and the need grew.
"Mitlerly eat not only children who will be treated 45 hours a week in the China on Wednesday," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies to the 35-hour insurance if children stay up to 14 hours."
46 part-time powers have been used since 1 September kitchen service: they heat the food delivered, get it around salt, bread and fruit, share the meal individually, give it out, drink it, drink it, and clean the kitchen.
"Employed workers will be assigned a kite," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the length of time.
"The kitchen aids are now firmly belonging to the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they are much stronger and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the guidance of the catalytic. "
For this is also the case: healthy food and cooking.
"Children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team will be meaningful.
For the kids, too.
"They have a well-known power in China, a person who trusts them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The soaping of the Kitai spaces - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning personnel.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charms that it has produced in comparison with the cost of ownership and promotion for the city as the most economic.
And that, although 46 part-time powers will be reintroduced.
"But these hours are not as high as 750 people in the education field," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UNO
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, an official leader of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will be applied for in the provinces for council elections. Three women apply for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be really representative and credible when women participate freely and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against a electoral process that coincided with the transition of international combat negotiations to an advisory role.
In this year the elections will be submitted for the first time peacefully by a democratically elected government.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will continue to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women of all registered 3.6 million voters have been registered.

Men try to expel 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to hire a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men of 13 years who stayed with friends on the Kolping Street were talking at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl’s phone.
The 13-year-olds started praying and went on with their friends.
In addition, one of the workers tried to pick up the phone and the girl's haircut, but it was a mistake.
The duo fled without any fear.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The results are running.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to convince managers of the Biskuit Manufacturer McVitie about the long-term obligation to produce in their work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had moved about the future of investments at Tollcross-Standardt.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which is made in addition to other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kexe.
McVities Owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade representatives would "hear first" if they changed their activities.
In a letter to the company's branch manager GMB Scotland McVitie said, "Remember to consider that funding for modernising production lines will not be advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can't get clear of the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is that our members are not in a position to get a clear picture of the future of Tollcross.
Generations of families have worked here, and the labour force has concentrated heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social participation.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and well-being, and in the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow requires a flowering production presence at McVitie".
A spokesman from Pladis said: "The branch leader at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this because we appreciate the continuing commitment of employees and trade representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all the companies that are engaged in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, are checking our businesses on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all of our areas and places - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million funds in our Tollcross-Standardt, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site completely and completely. If our operations are to change the location, the employees and their trade representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn three years before Neymar?
The page of La Liga may enhance your interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be released in her persecution of Neymar after giving a bid of £189 million to release her release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record collapse?
The sensory approach has closed the transfer window in summer, as the League 1 Club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous brand, while Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and the world's top-paid professional sports player. PSG offers more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although it is a source near the Catalan state that the club has always given its best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president in front of this view?
As Manchester City 2014 learned interest in the signature of Blaise Matudii, Nasser Al-Khelaif had a strong warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand against them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the Clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign when they do, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, where the Spanish union began expressing its interest in the PSG-media field player Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could suffer the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers for Neymar.
Rotated and damaged
In the evening of Friday on Saturday, an unknown actor turned into a roller in the King's field before the entry number 30 and arranged for over 200 euros for the wear of the car.
The police Schramberg, telephone 07422/27 01-0, offers hints.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car hit him on his bike, the driver of a VW Touran had to wash up and touch the guide plan.
The 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW against 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau was on his way to Leese.
In the area of Stolzenau's location, he was given a pkw on his bike, so he had to climb right.
The Touran-Fahrer reached the lead planes.
The Pkw created Sachshaden.
The driver of the present Pkw, a Mercedes Benz, had overrun a Lkw and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident victim, that the accident was not even noticeable.
The police now offer witnesses of the accident as well as the driver of the car in question to contact the police station in Stolzenau, Tel. 05711/92060.
Interview: "Domspatten Report Published by Papst-Brüder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatten report on the abuses is published by Papst-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen provides further discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are the Church", explained after publication against the German press agency, he was waiting for a pardon from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domcapell Mayor Georg Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of the Emerited Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful to the view of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own beliefs or their false assessment of the past.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" argued, however, that in the reporting of violence in the courts, there will be a "two-fold" measure.
With regard to the environment in Regensburg, no one doubts that there is a need to deal with "serious and damaging acts", which must be punished and prevented in the future; however, be the "grade of media manipulation", such as author Lucetta Scarffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of naming the Catholic Church as the source of all rites is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scarofia.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bayeric Roundfunk: "I like to go to the church and that's a found fresco."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "Schools have been a very normal pedagogical means" "to be finished with healthy children, as I was one."
It began to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In the context of the reports on abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger was often raised.
After all, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, wrote the memorial band "My Brother of the Pope" (in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into custody," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Bistum Regensburg with the statement of law, Ulrich Weber?
In total, 547 Regensburg's Domspatzens were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plusibility" victims of overdoses, 67 Domspatzens were sexually abused.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "So it can be concluded that, in many cases, there were forms of physical and psychological violence used by Domkapellmeister R.
The punishment for the students was even more severe in the event of high emotionality.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories of him".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger has been rejected.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Functions of Violence against Protection in the Regensburger Domspatzen" provides a surprising picture of Domkapell Master Georg Ratzinger.
To a large number of students, his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also seems to be a choliarist and perfectionist who has been handy when a domspatz musically did not perform a top performance.
How do you value this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you make fun of yourself and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all present.
He has only once been dedicated to eight pages and is clearly free from any suspicion of mediation or cooperation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence in the pre-school also occurred outside its scope.
In any case, it is not possible for him to learn later or take the first instructions seriously.
The Domspatzen Gymnasium, on which he worked, was found by practically all those questioned as - so verbal - "Salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
Similarly, the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent witness, describing him as "heavy", "loved", "competent", "competent" and "expensive", as an extremely good teacher who regularly provided for the boys with kitchen, kitchen and bonbons and "always surrounded by children's dreams".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to verbal abuse.
That he not only broke his legs and threw the key on the ground but also distributed ovarians and went to the horses or ears, he had already given himself years ago, regretted deeply, and apologized for it.
However, it must be said to his honor that such education methods were widely extended in the period of the 1960s and 1970s, in the case of parents and teachers.
Do you know any other methods of torture?
Of course, I think of each of us who was born before 1968.
I've also experienced it in a world school, a state Gymnasium.
Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the recent sexual abuse and violence in the school, it is free of charge.
You already wonder if it has not been done with his reputation and role as a brother of Benedict XVI. that many media have just attacked him.
Yes, many who have never understood him are still afraid of him.
But the truth is: The report leaves Georg Ratzinger in any way!
In the media, the report reported very much on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatten.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be present in the final report for any development or cooperation in relation to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not quite clear.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claims to be trusted by the Domcappel master.
Not even the parents were tired.
"I've never been able to talk to my father or my mother about it," said a concerned assistant to the others, "I've been very sad."
The real problem with the disclosure of sexual abuse was, and it is, that most victims are shams.
If they don't even ask for parents and grandparents, then there's no choice for a leader who would have been a colleague of the performer in a professional manner.
How do the Domspatchen Schools Ratzinger's role evaluate the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A asked student formulated it as follows: "In addition to sexual abuse ... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had legal knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators.
I also hold it... too absurd to accept that he is justified ... the lips have opened more or less intelligible or even more clearly than against his parents, international leaders, confidence teachers etc.
That you're talking to him about sex...
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that the students concerned in advance and/or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any involvement.
The same cannot be expected of him either not to prevent him or to have been brought to the public.
There is no reason, therefore, to link his good name with these recurring crimes, as it has happened in some cases.
In the media was a lot of "Gewaltexessen" to read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former Domkapell Master Georg Ratzinger is quoted in the report "Wegsees".
Does he have to live with this project?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that has been mixed up in the reporting system and linked to a serious message from sexual abuse and violence and anywhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.
But that's exactly what we're talking about again.
There is a clear distinction: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the doms, between sexual abuse and violence, and, once again, we say other premises.
In addition, the report deals with events since 1945, and also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the leader of the Domspatchens.
All the terrible prégelpadagogic, the cases in which boys of Saudi teachers have been regularly and maltreated and left unhindered, are all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where they have really had to overcome scandalous circumstances.
But with whom Domkapelll had to do nothing, Georg Ratzinger was able to see the boys only when they were already on the Domspatzen Gymnasium.
It was, as the majority of witnesses stressed, the theme "Preschole" tabu.
You were just happy to be out and enjoy the much better treatment and even for many "paradise" terms.
So what else was there on the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: He already ruled discipline, but not even Saudi violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, when the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories of him".
This remains the highest priority of the draft.
In spite of all efforts, however, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the authorities at the pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not effective and responsible, he did not want to hear anything (so the witness) and then again in 1993.
Do Georg Ratzinger's conclusions follow the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzen Gymnasium, which even reproduced the report.
In this regard, he points out that "that in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be applied."
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommends urgent steps.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was found, as spring punishments were prohibited even in Bayern for a long time.
In the meantime, they arrived in a legal grant, as each of us may still know.
It was also difficult for him to appreciate where the victims might have been overrun or dramatized and where they really had been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always gone.
I just don't think so.
As early as 1980, the pre-school penalty was officially abolished in Bayern.
Forstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed yes, it is not fair to apply today’s pedagogical standards at the same time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We tell historians about the "Fallstrike of Anachronism", so the risk of assessing past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the prince's right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which has always been outlawed and also not to what has been violated in the pre-school on reciprocity and violence to innocent children, which is already far beyond the usual.
That's all very bad, and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into custody because all of this had nothing to do with him.
Its means of discipline and punishment, therefore, to be carried to the hair and ears, were widely distributed in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was prohibited, he also held strictly to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did George Ratzinger repeat in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Who is the subject of prejudice also in language?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., tells of his perspective, since the Domspatz played only a neighbor role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he was leading a strict regime there.
But this must also be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the requirements of unconditional discipline, it would have been almost impossible for him to form an institution of world history of Europe and its musical traditions, both in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone, you are now no longer making great songs and in front of every success, just as in what area but always discipline, patience and self-control.
As for a person, what happened to Georg Ratzinger when you spoke to her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work at the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger and have always experienced as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and hearty people who can't imagine that he could do anything about a flight too.
I regularly visit him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him as a member of his family 23 years after his emeritus.
Those who have not forgiven him to this day that he had once been hard on them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most doms are grateful to him today that he has enriched his life and brought them the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, caring teacher - a strong father, of course, that might be - but he was also a loving person to whom they look today and who just admire them.
And please, once again quite clear: everything you're going to do to him, are methods of entertainment that were then in the agenda.
We can be glad that we've been over this time for a long time.
But it's most unfair, a man, just because he's prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a media sin note.
That's the bad idea that's down there, just so obvious.
Because the report just published leaves him.
Now the stand would be for a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps even Germany would not be known to leave the Regensburg Domspatzens in peace at last.
