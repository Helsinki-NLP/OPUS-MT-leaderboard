Tom didn't know who to believe.
"The story was so funny that I literally died of laugh." "So how are you talking to me now?" "Of course I don't die, it was just a figure of language." "Then you're saying you used 'literally' in a figure." "Of course, there's some problem with that?" "No, I'm just glad that you can torture the language at such a point, that a word comes to mean the opposite of yourself."
He's running behind what?
Want a hug?
I'm sure she has other skills.
What have you eaten?

It's getting dark.
Tom is convinced that Mary should do that.
She tried herself.
Death is scary.

It was the gentlemen who were enjoying it.
How can I get home?
A man with a good sense wouldn't talk to me that way.
The dog's sleeping.
This stone weighs five tons.
Don't come near me, I'm cold.

"No!" shouted Tom.
The doctors thought he had a cold.
Tom almost quit the heat.
You can't raise the plane.
Don't run here.
What's your favorite podcast?
Tom baby.
He seemed very happy.
Now that you're in pain of gargant and fever, you should probably stay in bed.
Idiot!
He came to the head-head table.
I was interested.
How much?
He's got a match.
Who do you think you'd do something like that?
Give a double click on the icon.
Tom never read the book that Maria gave him.
Will you be at the meeting tonight?

He's patient.
Please do it quickly.
Tom asked Mary to open the window.
I'd like to know, too.
How old are you?
Was that what Tom said?

Nature seems peaceful, but it's actually a eternal bloodbath of animals dying in horrible ways.
Look at the shit Tom did.
They know that.
Are you familiar with football rules?
It's your party.
