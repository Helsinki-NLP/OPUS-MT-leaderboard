The rest of the UKIP who reject those who live with HIV is a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage said that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom for health tourism, and when, with this in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him whether people living with HIV are included in the inseparables.
First you use special arguments, then you expose them with a vulnerable homophobic.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to do the backache of the intolators to chronic hypocondria who think they're all right.
I think it's you who use special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right angles, does not exist in practice.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So nobody would be affected by the UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is nothing in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote drawn from a torch is not evidence.
Yeah, so you'll get the message.
Mail did not write the report, he only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot to spread such popular propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by homophobia charges.
Farage's phrase is very surprising, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He has made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You'll have to be able to give it back to you.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like when the media talk about what you don't like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his loyal disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that mankind's complexities are something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is also serious in Ireland and Spain.
With the new crisis that is happening in the austerity period, there will be no arrangements.
Waiting almost 5% of growth in 2015 is a great pleasure.
Ireland was the ''Tigre de l'Europeane' for us, there's a few more.
We met the next time!
This should read the article.
We are trying to believe that Ireland is a green country and that a 'NOW' is being produced.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a simple three-way work, a continuing migration.
With these ingredients not of what ''passer' for the moment with the coming of the Polishs.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant transition without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece stood in front.
That their development was not a long calm stream, it is in view of recent events.
Lowest impact rates in Europe?
That's a mistake!
Latvia has an impact rate of 0% on businesses.
There is now a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on the real taxes paid by the multinationals.
If there is a report from 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full wages.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge, and there are new (and expensive) cars all along the road, just as before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the repetition is evident in the daily mouth since the return.
Is it supposed to be economical?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon come to light.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra is involved in an increase on A140.
Does Ryanair now count to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a new fleet of equipment, so some boxes and radios on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That's what I'm saying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once in a row.
So this would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay the passengers extra for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish businesses, you wouldn't be allowed to leave on vacation, young man
I've never taken Ryanair, and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to their heart.
Whatever the article on Ryanair reveals dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than basic fare are going to take it to themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with additional costs due to this incident.
I ask what will be the delay and if it is necessary to compensate passengers and, if that is the case, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of air controllers at the airport.
Passengers were put in another plane for less than an hour, they have no right to compensation.
I'm sorry to discover you and your pension dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that runs the English ISIS in Syria, not as you say.
Good Travel
Last Sunday in Paris, France-Bourgeois Street: the Marais is in a large part of the Pietonnier, and literally round the world.
People do not come to a mass for the quality of restaurants (sometimes, for most) or for the Review Hall in the Whites-Mantainaux Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly pusier).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly alive and alive.
With a lot of foreigners who rely on ..
Do you think the opening of the Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Frances Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday with 50% tourists.
@loes Faux!
The only argument that seemed acceptable to me is that of the areas that receive an important number of foreign tourists and it is new because they buy in detail.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of business for the same reasons each year.
It remains the industry where cost-effective equipment, operated on Sunday, will reduce prices.
Dominic rest is a right that benefits, except for exceptions, employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have the least competence to reform the labour code.
Then they blow it up.
What's the law for?
To meet some of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday I bring my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not we!
This is access to culture ...
And this is also the rule of working time.
the way of life that he has defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's succession was, against her will, used to pay the expenses?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others not terrible.
No doubt his succession would want to be part of the castle, if you'd like to speak to me.
His preference for a nationalist victory/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of such places as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas in all of them, and also add his well-known hatred to the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Not anymore.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he took the lead in the other aristocrats of the government who wanted to discuss a “agreement ” with the Nazis, and he was very successful.
Thanks to its magnificent rhetoric and its energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and, finally, the whole world can thank God for having had these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the bar and nothing else.
The size of Churchill has nothing to do with this debate.
His descendants sold stones on the free market in order to collect the cost of succession, they could even benefit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they collect money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the money of taxes.
When it was “the time of truth, ” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A slowdown in the internal market by public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding embezzlement, while infrastructure can be defined in a slightly renewable manner.
With regard to the social reforms announced by the Minister, they well reflect the true French illusory: lack of confidence in dialogue
Return to the principles of the Prince.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
That the weakest of us are not in need!
Whether we come to his aid, or he has DROIT in exchange for services he has made or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the smile corresponds to this vision.
There is also the valuer who lives from his property.
There is a difference between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives from his pensions.
A good luck looking at two for a couple above, it's time.
The small genius of the Finance only lacks imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructures.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are being overcome.
The need for infrastructure is therefore marginal in no new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the issue of aging arises in response to a recession, which is only a wild development which is therefore brutal.
You'd have reason 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of bars, coal mines, cars...
But if you want to make the future climate-energy shock worse, then the need for investment is growing: isolation, railway network renewal, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
A taxity that fosters high incomes and pensions.
Who's in power?
Obtained by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's benefits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have been sold by buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and I decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's profit.
I think it's essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put in place this philosophy, we knew a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open-source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their subscientious philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people have no value in the design, for their options, functionality and price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
We stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car builder", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flowering port industry, with radically different approaches for people and different markets.
It's more healthy and must be encouraged.
That's what's in our interest to everyone.
I'm glad you've found exactly what you're looking for and it's not an Apple product, even if I've made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our fellow Umpfrontists who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, even on Parisian bobos) could tell us what the author(s) would tell us about the ideas of the kind and tell us the books they're just trying to fight.
Or do they attack just as described in the Current Figaro, Minutes or Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemour?
All right, Jean, I love you very much, and you're some intelligent and cultivater.
I said this about Judith on the road to Furusato calling Holopherne, near which I had not come (I did not have his soul's existence).
Otherwise, in the "fund", because you refer to it, I don't care, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends can get me out of my apartment, because I'm slow but I understand...
@ Jean: recognize that, culturally, to take Judith to Holopherne, it is.
Who was afraid to ask the world?
But of what do we fear those who fear?
Furato and @ give us some answers.
The first by calling on Judith from the Bible, the second by qualifying Judith Butler for a very symbolic burial.
We see how close these studies are to the deepest of them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate.
It's another thing, much deeper.
@ Have you read, Jean, that the World published an article on the need for theology?
@: As for an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
I don't think I'm very strict about fighting ideas from the only exposure to their tractors (cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix, theologian).
But as I explained to our friend empfrontist, it's all the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not on the other side of the news.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic remnant of hunger, I'm happy with "The Second Sex" (that was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's views.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon suddenly appeared when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated for the disappointment of having the vision sometimes blocked by clouds.
It was great here at FNQ.
Yes, the night of the last night would really close the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the lab responsible.
But if the Work accepts our unfair budget, we will make it a real color as soon as possible.
That surprises you, doesn't it?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also been able to cover all week of the rain of Perseide meteors and for virtually all important astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing what is in heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for an observer, even though things are much better on the other side of Cordillere.
There were between 10 and 20 minutes, where I couldn't see the eclipse because of clouds above the Melbourne Bay.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHO looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I think your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you fall.
Who or what, when it comes to the end of it with its bursting?
You seem to spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government to then accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Superb photo of the moon above the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
We'd say Mars went into coli with Earth!
Nothing about bourgeois and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Another liberalism is in the process of killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article in this too or not.
The details and arguments of these claims are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that we can make an opinion.
Go to see today Tuesday 15 October the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at least five years.
In Greece, the burden is getting worse.
However, there are examples to follow.
The news reform would generate an application for an order of EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economic Affairs claims that these claims for compensation are not based.
What if the Ministry of Economy errs?
Will the decision-makers who have taken the political advantage resulting from the bold attack of the notaries have the same courage in presenting the bill to the state budget?
It's his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
@lol The State is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while the household is born by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered to be productive, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments in tomorrow's growth and thus future revenue.
Some response elements.
A regretful decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrate: the health of the benefits of world pharmaceutical societies must be preserved first and foremost.
Jolie's theory of the plot.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical personnel would like to be able to serve them, but they have their hands tied to the law as it is written by the politicians.
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risks of surgical intervention, the safe shoot rooms for drug users rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncooked masses.
In fact, doctors do not earn money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmaceuticals.
doctors don't earn money with drugs Because the Liberians want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should tell you how it works.
Doctors around the world are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to make the mistake of doing so, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business benefits and "search".
So read some rare reports on our pharmaceutical costs and on the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the world prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is being sold free or only on orders.
This is strengthened by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, either directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing Marijuana's inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that freeze them and the honours that are necessary.
Although some medicinal products manufacturers may not be happy using alternatives such as marijuana, those who come to a version offering good quality products at well-known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, but you're mistaken, there's a lot of things happening in the colleges for doctors and pharmaceuticals.
While in this hospital, they were happy to serve until someone put the bullet in the ear of a hospital official.
We can't just write letters on the tree...
If "researchers" in social sciences did research instead of policy and networking, their "work" could be used.
An investigation investigator does not compare one fact to another.
Compare is not looking.
To compare is to do the pedagogy not of research.
It cannot be said that "the search is about to be applied" and then in the same jet "it has to be experienced at all times".
If your research is boring, why try it?
If your research isn't busy, why do you ask yourself to apply it?
Can I explain how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot imitate the mathematics alone could easily resemble mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow students to learn how to use new technologies, but how would they be able to learn new technologies if they did not know?
The pisa tests are only a indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What does it mean to build a indicator that tells you about what's going on, a self-promoting will, a trompery?
One track to train teachers: to avoid the training of sophists and ideologies and to teach practitioners.
factory reject the paragraph on the stages (which helas is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservation: "It is a device that leads first to the reproduction of current practices, and that does not allow the system to progress " .
In view of the general consensus on the status of the French system, it is not possible to want only practitioners to teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training.
Theorists of education should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you expect to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put his foot in an operational block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
To give more weight to the theoryists of education would definitely destroy it.
Your analogy is completely wrong: if I didn't like to be operated by a practice that has only a theoretical training, I would still prefer to operate by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned the task.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative member for the fight against copyright violations by David Cameron
Why didn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exams thank you.
If one day I feel guilty of violating the author's right, it'll be easier for me to read an article like that.
In an information economy, violations of copyright = flight.
That's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a license does not cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing.
By using the content without having the right license, you are privatizing the artists of their pay.
You can always discuss peding hypotheses - but it's from the flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so real.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I feel guilty of violating the copyright
Obviously, this does not bother you to privacy the artists of their income.
If they think that they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am glad that they are deprived of this fiscal income.
Lesson 1 should show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they will leave all intellectual property to the site under the general conditions that they have passed through.
Perhaps if they share the audiences of their mp3 ballader with a partner in the school bus, they should be expelled to violate the law in this way.
Ah, if we can export this resource to which we are returning, the rehearsal who says it's going to be bad....
If it's a PS member who claims it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France takes people down to the base on the assistants constantly.
I do not want my children to bear the burden of this policy.
What takes France to the bottom is talks like you.
@gus I've been working in private business ever since.
I had the chance to have worked in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France, but it is rare.
I'm hired because I know I don't have the ability to run a company and this choice allows me to get red shoes on the zero patterns I often encounter.
In my pockets I share the place of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the awful truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies that the heads of French companies are constantly quoted to ask for reforms in France, in Germany, companies have structured their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises and small enterprises - What do French employers expect to do so??
What's the state holding their hand?
What is this state that they accuse of empire?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-corporate business couple of yours!
Remember, what created you as a job, as added value, to be also serious?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an unsolved problem: the incompetence of the heads of French companies who are unable to create jobs and who are slowing down and waiting for the State's permanent assistance!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, parental charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35 hours, and some, walking on eggs, may claim the reduction of wages without their removal!
I hate to see all the negative comments on this subject.
What is ironic is how people always complain about First Group.
According to what I see where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us contributors.
They tried to keep themselves in a lot rather than being transformed.
This does not mean that the ways of making ice is not improved since the West is occupied.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Railway.
Unfortunately we don't have the power to do this, hey.
I tried to have them recently, but I couldn't.
Well, the lab's gonna pull us back, isn't it...
It's an international branch.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in bids.
But it seems that we are not very well managed, most of our private services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticisms when First won the Virgin contract, all to finally cancel the decision.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operation contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they have repeated during the referendum campaign, is entirely for the common and sharing and believes that workers must all go beyond the borders.
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision;)
This may be because the Dutch management is on good track while the British are not.
What ScottRail needs is not just a change of ownership but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"It was a fighter girl."
Sir, I have, but I really have this kind of expression.
Suppose the fact that being "battant" is a quality that is superior to many others, the concern of others, the intelligence, the listening, for example, the fact that being "batting" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancers "battants", which are no longer dead, I know of the paralyzed.
There's nothing to do with the merit of a disease.
Let's start again.
I'm not telling you it's LA condition to manage, I'm telling you it's AIDS.
Nothing has seen anything worthy of...!
When you look at the examples of your life, there's nothing you can do to judge them.
It's a start.
In other words, it would be only an instant, that we can have the right to get out of a disease or that we can be forced not to leave it, is simply a monster.
The body follows or does not.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite the will, despite trust in medicine, do you have an idea of what C is?
In view of the contrary, if, having a strong morality, there is no doubt that it is easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatment, to try experimental treatments as this woman has done, and not to reject them with fear.
Someone who's fighting in medicine is first of all someone who trusts the doctor.
But if we prefer to return to "Lord" it's another thing.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are for moralists.
When you catch a salad, a real one, you're going to throw you down to the point of not becoming a zombie.
I personally caught two, salads, big ones, and if I'm as "battu" as these psychologists say, it completely got me out.
Unless this fight is just closing the teeth, suffering pain, and covering the hips.
I believe that the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalised a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least this time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten anniversary.
It was carried out “fastly ” and then built under the carpet.
Is this the story we related at the time?
Has the communist become a nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans during the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MINDRE rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack her?
As for RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be evaluated by the western compressor.
The West used a smoke screen to detect a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally declared its independence and was fully recognized by the Western States who then lied mainly about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first mandate in order not to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the day.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic from Tiran (even if we do not like him).
In my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting seismic events in Greece, measuring the pézoelectric level in the quartz.
This kind of study is invaluable and thanks to us for sharing the results.
A hope, then, but the wisdom is to put this water has nothing to do with that of the planet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years of Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
So how to follow it.
Like those who involve animals with a threat of arrival.
Thank you, Master of Science, for providing us with these experimental tests that are carried out in the world.
How would the animals be (Before )?
There is no doubt about the perception of other elements whose rate changes in case of seismicity.
Like the radon, for example.
A gas has inhospitable priorities for man but may be depleted by animals.
All these methods are identifiable for man, but not for the measure instruments he has.
But we don't have reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed (and for centuries) that some animals have been acting strangely for a few hours with a seismic, including chickens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I have seen an art report relating to the fight against two scientific teams, one California and the other Japanese, in order to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to the field of terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before a six-year-old.
Well, I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why are you so cruel about this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we examine things calmly and carefully, we publish them in a serious review, and no one ignores them.
As long as we speak of the "signs" given by animals, we get the same way: the whole world will remember that 5 minutes before a sysmosis the red fish would suddenly turn around.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He made it too much as a mother from London.
When we hear the LBC program we can't stop thinking that this man doesn't know anything and that he's always trying to make a difference with a blog.
He never answers directly to any of these.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked his representative what he was doing.
He couldn't count one point.
He made so many promises to make himself a mayor and he didn't have one.
This only highlights what the rest of the Conservative Party is, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's a thief.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people's worship of celebries has been involved.
The Londoners voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) take the direction of the party, the rate of popularity of the Tories will grow the ceiling I am certain.
May God help us.
I'm not sure: people like blogs, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what we told the Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
Anyway, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French are truly and are always distracted from the history of the war of the Pacific.
For all who have been given the burden of reading a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "ferrous desert" speak, as unfortunate as the dead who remain there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there since the Savo battle) did not want to return to it.
We're actually past the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even though the mission is about to end.
It's the little ones.
But the side around here is a total infusion.
Calculate the kerosene consumed to achieve the depredabilize objective completely..
It's enough to walk through the list of sponsors like philanthropes.

I'm waiting for the website with patience!
Your story makes me look back, identifying me a little by the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn in the Moulin Blanc on Brest!).
Head also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and to show with enthusiasm that the Bretons are great travelers!

Bonsoir I think that the good red rose that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a sum of our taxes on financing the dreams of some adventures as sympathical as they are!
Is there any players in the current Serbian training that is of the origin of Kosovo?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, sometimes at Juventus and now in Fenerbahce, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
It's Bisevac, Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a center of land or before in the 70s and 80s and led many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovine, and has played as an attack on the great team of Velez who, under the auspices of Lieutenant Suleman Rebac, has completed the second time in the Yugoslav League (and has also counted points such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsenne Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a big player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was connected to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when the Count arrived, then he went to Fener and as soon as I know he's not entitled.
Maybe he can do something else, maybe in the Super Indian League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you're a neighbor.
The trick is that the team of this drone is not the team of true Albania today.
It seems to have been the team of the Great Albania, which includes all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (that I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian team with the map not of what the Great Albania was called, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to grant the country’s benefits to neighboring countries.
How can we feel "an explosion of joy" seeing two towers sinking knowing that women, men and children are in the inside?
How??
What I have a little bit in this "witnessing" is that the only thing that can do is, once again, to suddenly rejoice in the terrible death of thousands of people, to witness to my eyes a "braceline" personality that all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Without a doubt, in the short time of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the inflexible horror.
We would have just thought, once, that for once, Muslims had succeeded in doing really and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan in his own heart.
Make qqch powerful.
That's great.
It would seem that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims who were moved by their feelings of humility.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We had a bit of a doubt.
The "Christian/Blanc/gaulois" incident cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he is aware of the general misery, social and cultural sub-development of the Muslim modern-day Arab world.
I'm talking about the faubourgs of Cairo or Alger, not the Dubai Tours.
The past mirror, of course, is not a comfort, on the contrary.
How does the Muslim world get out of this devilish storm?
At the same time, 2 major poisions offend the Arab world: bigot conservativeism of local powers and fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the gel of thought and the excommunication (duce or army) of its critical expression.
That we had understood it before, it should not be repeated to the Muslims.
It's the only way.
Does Eddy Fullel care about this article?
I guess it's true in many countries.
But in Great Britain, the atom marks the beginning of six long months of sleep, tired and depressed, which affects the well-being and humor of many people.
In addition, the whole world is sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes, it becomes the hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for humor and well-being.
The Automune is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath automatically.
Not so much to cut the breath as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being on the point of death.
In Great Britain, if you have the chance, the summer falls a weekend.
We've had a nice year this year, don't make your little grunt that cuts the clichés!
Not everyone.
I'm very sick in winter.
But now I'm in retreat and I'm no longer developing immunity to the seeds outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about dying, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of awestruck, with a febrility that culminates with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Noël, the risks of neglect and the full of other wonderful words.
It's enough not to stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these months of sleep and gray make me a lot happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of the increases for children , the amount allocated by the State is mainly from the figures 8 to 10 .
However , with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase to this extent , these are particularly the figures 4 and 5 that are concerned ( average income ) according to Figure 2 .
The removal of the half-party concerned mainly widows is not of any treaty in the article or rather of its impact is fully under assessment: EUR 230M is a non-responsibility of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and it is assumed to be incorrigible.
And it's not ready to arrange.
Well, we're not on the right foot, but we're singing.
For once the PS makes a policy rather to the left we won't cry...
Of course, those who are part of 20% of the richest must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Keep on doing this, and you will encourage these 20% to work less or to leave.
Well, I know that's not politically correct, but I'm telling you at the same time.
Live the Trots and OCIs recycled to PS: they have everything.
Adam, you see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population has 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone to hide as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the use of money is exceeded, money is no longer used to make money, i.e. to make the greatest harm.
It is part of 20% of the richest.
There is no doubt also 20 per cent of workers working most (and creating the wealth of which a part is fairly redistributiond).
A fair tax must allow these branches to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so much to lower your hands and live in social minimums, especially if you have a social housing.
The tops of the hair cutters in the red hammer have been a happy success.
I've made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to get to the reception or face the least concerns.
It's enough to go to someone, to sleep there, to row back and forth.
In the meantime, this will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a type of property insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the good logo!
Ah, 6h too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly dangerous" It's not true.
You've just really missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurd.
At 24 hours after an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change the locks, made provision for a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb was secured, but at the same time).
So why does this article mention Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I'm DOORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Good morning I'm looking for people who have already used bnb just to comfort me.
I'm going to pay an account and a month's rent, but I'm a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are you going?
"Suppose the troops," sang the Bu$herie on all the sounds...
Infectious weapons, then.
I'm sure this will make families and close friends of thousands of dead Kurds to be able to learn that their parents and friends suffered something else than the chemical bombings of Saddam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain Polish).
Furthermore, what would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still useful?
It is not too clear the author's style: "to search for weapons of mass destruction.
We're fine.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: IS IT THE time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be enhanced if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the same time, our teachers are now gaining more than engineers.
And we don't think teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not seen because the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/sleeve to its professors, so they are staying with them.
A type of teletravail forced in sum, except that the employer does not pay either the computer, Internet connection, or supplies.
In addition, it's so much the 17h floor per week and 4 months of vacation that we don't get to fill the maths CAPES, come, we'll wait for you.
How did you not want to cultivate bad skills that your parents fear when dealing with you as a nurse?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the djihadites so that the Kurdish population can make better use of themselves.
Where we see Bush's administration is absolutely through.
My first job graduated was in the sale in London three times, but it was a post for which a diploma was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be opened for the London Metro, it was paid $5,000 per year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, you do not do it if you do not find a job, try to find anything that pays well or you like to do.
If I'd stayed in the job, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I do not like the work in the business, so I look forward to spending either in public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL This article is coming really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was a three-year legacy.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed students?
Disappearing white hair like art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy/political sciences, is what is called chommer diplomas.
I've got one of these diplomas and I've finished the production director.
It turns out that the important was not the degree, but, as the article above says, a good professional course, starting at school and all along the university.
Some starting wages were lower but we quickly raise the ladders because in the real world, what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This discussion of engineering studies/artificial films has been over the years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up early in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are blue hair?
It's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about colleges like studying the media or whatever the show's missing where you're going.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are true stories.
We need people who can explain the major issues to the students, which include the importance of cultural foundations such as literature, art, etc., and they value them.
Would it not be better for a genuine territorial policy to detonate Paris and dynamicize the rest of France?
Personally, I see bad people from the end of Essonne and Val-d'Oise make 80km to go back on a bicycle every day to work in Paris.
Intra-murders and small-circuit inhabitants already have many more common means of transport (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and closed parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is channelled by the 2RMs.
Unfortunately, it is hoped that the City of Paris is working with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much to benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for a vehicle crash device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding a office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not gonna be all.
When we discuss with pets and other users of common transport for which they do not suffer, it does not seem to me that the main reasons that arise are: 1/ this is a dangerous hyper with all these vans, these trucks, these rockets that run super fast and come from the survival of the vehicles 2/ are completely polluted in the head To me the cyclable tracks are slow, it is necessary to reduce the motor traffic (the urban type load), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), to comply with the road code systemically (even when the vehicle is required to adjust the code of the road that is written on the road, and do not need to be able to use the tunnels in the year rounds.
The cyclable tracks are of apartheid, but the occupation of the urban area needs to be rebalanced.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word on the location of the bike in common transport?
EELV's right.
The target of 15% of Velocational displacements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think that Anna Hidalgo rolled the greens in the oven.
In addition to the press report on OR, the ELVs appear to be skeptical.
You prefer some optimism.
Before the rocket starts, it would be better to find who really hid behind this mask.
Index: This is not Russia.
I'm not sure to love the way the world develops.
It looks terrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to the CEDH, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they would have to file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases will be settled by awaiting the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow Pan Am 103 no more.
Malaysia Airlines is not in the wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the security of the airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been caught, Ukraine had launched in the area of air raids against the rebels and all aircraft could surely be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that airlines can pay for the rights of development of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their government usirpater / the ultranationalists of western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in large that Putine has defeated the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is going on in their heavens.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the provision of arms by the CIA to the opposition forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for its actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It is important to think that Abbott is saying in Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-supported rebels.
I hope he can provide evidence to establish his allegations.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
Calling yourself Ricardo and being such a blessing in echo, it's exciting!
Calling Polaire is losing the north is happy.
One single question is: is the poverty of today more poor than the poor of yesterday?
I can't stop to notice that those who criticise the most viral book of Picketty don't have it!
It's easy to read, I've had a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income production, capital income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, property of capital, merit and inheritance in the term log.
It shows that today's capital concentration combines it from the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it is the two world wars that have reduced the capital concentration from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration continues after...
Bernajuzan: You don't know what to say.
I ask you how long it took you to read this passage knowing that a person's concentration capacity has a few limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is right, we can discuss it without having read the book which is essential to argue in a unique way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you been reading it?
Is the central theme of his poem, summarized by the press, false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
So I'm going to sum up his central thesis and that's where I look like a pure smoker.
The notion of a difference between rich and poor is subsidized.
Is not humanity wholly rich?
And this increase in population growth is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and certainly deserves the price.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age in which most people begin to find their place in the world.
I hope this price will not be a burden for the young girl and she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old addition according to which colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that she is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular areas of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little weird.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom, but she said that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years.
Does not it itself become part of these "colored evils"?
You shouldn't have any "time to stay" on this site.
You yourselves are a terrible evil.
It's absolutely revolutionary.
No, his father wasn't married at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for it to receive higher education and it has the right to decide for itself about its marriage.
For this reason, it's something unusual in Pakistan, as far as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that a mean Pakistani girl should often marry at 14 years of age without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it in a way that's pretty exciting for you.
It may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
It was rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange, who apparently has a little bad to find her partner from Marlene Dietrich.
I've just seen the last two seasons that are quite different, but I have to admit that it's one of the best series of horrors, one of the most boring!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to the perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is just turning around.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof buff).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have all of a couple of times that look at 13 episodes set on 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, outside of Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's especially the risks of scenes and mountains that hit me.
AHS has an original plan estimate that does not adversely affect the acceptance of today's productions.
Let me get out of here a little bit of seeing you throw the sponge forward for the next season without even waiting to be able to enjoy the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say, well, there are many other things.
It's not just for me Jessica Lange (and above all her way and how she uses it) is really UN of the series pillars outside of technical qualities.
And good bah, I'm looking very much for her.
Then I find that the series is written, she wants too much to do things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in 2 there was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see you doing 10 American Horror Story or it's gonna end like 24 hours chronics what.
But everyone does what he wants here!
That's why I'm saying, "I'm not going to see it anymore" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view of nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she's gonna be fatal.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
In terms of less tax rates, please - cuts rather in State spending.
No, let's increase the costs, please.
Those who wanted to know about the expenditure were excluded.
Deploying plenomers on relatively small expenditure posts, such as development assistance
The problem is that this is less than the wrong margin in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nukes rather than the change in orientation that voters seem to call their wills and during this time, in each field, they seem to be much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see in their game and find them with bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditure.
Debt is one of the main assets held by financial institutions in this country.
The 'dew' is nothing to worry about.
I would not have any problem with the government adjusting a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would be useful.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been entirely honest about how to reduce taxes, but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the subsidies to small-scale windmills and the nuclear centres that cost the double what they deserve, you get to a figure that makes the Tax of Labor and Lib-Dem very rare on the most luxurious residents.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who gets 35 000 £ per year per payer about 5 000 £ (a seventh of their salary), someone with 50 000 would pay around 10 000 £ (a fifth), etc., and someone with 200 000 € pay around 70 000 (a little more than a third).
And social contributions?
More social contributions, more local taxes, more parking costs and the car vineyard, and that is before VAT.
Nearly 30% of my money is taken to the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I'm paid in a decent way, but not extravagance.
Not that this is a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But we don't seem to believe that money falls from heaven, or that it's not important to know where billions of tax books are going.
How can a shopkeeper who's looking for work at the port can prove it?
When even, 20% of the chamberers wouldn't look for it, that means 80% are looking and not found.
As my own roommate, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances.
In fact, I haven't had any news from Paule Employment for months, does that mean that the agents are more involved in control operations than actually making announcements of employment?
I don't see any interest.
Because it's not for the state to provide work.
If Poland Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you have to pass from Poland Employment.
What about a sensitive subject?
All of us have rights and duties, in the event of ensuring that the customers fulfil their duties in line with their rights.
As a controller, they are entitled to transport to users by means of a means of transport, a service manager or the employees of their work, etc.
No one's calling the scandal in these cases, right?
It is really good to remember that the rights of the unemployed: the only two times I had been in Poland Employment, my rights to the ARE had been badly established, and on one of the files, 40 per cent had failed to fight hard.
It takes time!
I'm not a legal expert.
The record and control are currently taking place, while Paule Employment is actually close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, which is those who pay the costs.
Non-Salarian politicians and French are given the rights they do not have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance is part of the valuation of paid work.
More than waiting for Arabic killer tweets...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict area.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the intention to ban the Hadj in Mexico this year from the three countries affected.
The country reports that 7,400 have seen their visa applications rejected because of their country of origin or their recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a comerian from Bosnia who contracted the cycle in Mexico during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a comerian from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it all right to propose to prevent Ebola's diseases from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was a simple sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict forty.
Nobody's lucky.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treatment of patients before they can leave.
If they hire Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not dragonish measures.
Nothing but the last week, people were contaminated after contacting people in West Africa, although they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the spread of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We are very much in favour of offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers in airports should be trained to identify people who have Ebola's typical symptoms, so that they can be my immediate in quarantine.
It is possible to pass the message of the first and second (including religious) group and it will merit the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt it is possible to enrich the image of God characterised by the entire cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far away from this concept there.
This is only 20 years ago that information appears as mankind's first data, while religion, out of the brain, has been directing our actions since Lucy may well be.
What is the interest of becoming a single Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is very minority in France today, no one has been forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet in the Church in any way, but only see the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, taking away the notion of sin, too "anxiogenesis"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no limited vision in France.
And in the world, it may be possible to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you consider it to be presupposed to Christ.
One century before he had said, "Don't do to anyone else what you don't want to do, that's all the Torah and the rest is just a comment: go and study!"
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agora.
Your "progression of justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is this a return to communism?:-)
Next step: the incarnation and resurrection will be removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who violated the moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to play their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors have been eliminated and forced to immigrate for a few centuries.
I'm too proud to buy this, the new Alien game, or Westeland 2.
And the new Elite game soon.
It doesn't happen to us.
I would personally choose SoM.
I love Westeland 2 (I even participated in its fund-raising campaign) but I don't think it's worth 30 £.
If this is the PC version that interests you, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to 30 £ and also offers a fine 20% reduction.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to 30 £ and also offers a fine 20% reduction.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The intelligence department's rapports block all sympathies.
Hello, is it 30 £ or 20% reduction, or does 30 £ include 20% reduction?
However, caution: PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's nothing.
It's time to buy a new video card * Make the needle*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam identifier, I think.
I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they will lose your library if they decide to serve against the people who hire it there while they're out of the planned area.
So join Elite's beta version: Dangerous.
So, was the 1940 France a "potterland"?
So you say, this Nobel prize has all the air of a gift.
Is it necessary to love France of 40, the "extraordinary stranger"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Literature asked if Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the primary authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and too low?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but I honestly doubt them.
Modiano, Levy, Musso has only a long-term relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
That would be better to judge.
Don't worry about the Chinese, the Brazilians and others.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modeano to his true value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to frequent Levy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the frescoes.
Since I drove one in Iceland, I don't stop seeing the Kia Sports everywhere.
I think this trick followed me up here.
Maybe she wants to break me up?
Do you accuse me of Superman III's horrible computer?
Good morning Dantra, always hate her?
Hello, DQ - no, not today, I took my medicine.
It's mercred!
I've had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the feast of beer and Nottingham.
It was bottled up.
I managed to take 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel is one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people down there, there were only CAMRA fans (not to be confused with camera fans).
It was really hard to drive back on Sunday.
On Monday night we went to the great father of a cat to play on the nine brand card.
Thanks to a real chance of starting up, I've been able to deal with several decades.
I hope if I reach 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks has arrived with a high ceiling.
I admire M.
Read a bit of Bouddha and you'll understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That's what I'm saying, without wanting to contradict you, I think you're a little away from the subject.
This famous total, it prohibits the interrogations for the dissidents when they leave the musculoskeletals.
She's not late for arms trafficking.
There are large open eyes such as Meddeb and Taiya or Boubaker or large closed eyes.
You have to choose.
It's not keeping our eyes closed that we get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental contrast: the totality of the authorities, organizations or associations representing, Muslim or non-, who have formally condemned the EI and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimity official sentences.
Who doesn't say a word.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for the whole world.
As I said thousands of times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indisputable to accuse them of priori and demand that they publicly prove to the rest of the French society that they have failed to doubt.
This principle is in my eyes the rejection of the Republic and can only contribute to the delicacy of French society.
If there's no doubt, there's so much to say.
Who doesn't say a word, but what do you mean?
Consent to a close relationship with the EI or to the conviction of the EI.
The silence is very practical, is the main weapon of those who want to manage the sword and the bow.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmaticly intense.
Alex Salmond predicted that the Ecosse could, at elections, "wine" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised to protect the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified in the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron has to laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely disturbed by the Ecosis that they have no seat.
They can do what they want in all electoral impunity.
I do not think even Cameron would be stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP would be a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to send an alarm for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and the UKIP that will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "Promesse" thinking that he would save his part but without realizing that he had signed the death sentence of his Scottish Members.
Not surprisingly, some working-listed Members are asking for accounts from their manager.
If SNP receives 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats are not available to the Conservatives, then they will be very well placed to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's rather important.
Not if the Labor or Conservatives want to be realized one day in England.
Citing the 8% pumps to the 85% destruction, this is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish Members are unable to vote on issues relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think it's good.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband did.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and it worked.
However, he is still in the position to be the first Minister in 2015 and since he won the lead of the Labour Party.
So, in large, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It's "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of the FRIC...
The same fascination for monitoring techniques is always the same.
In the end, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I expect the next ticket: Amazon manufactures free VOTRE based on VOTRE profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's like a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, public books, or purchased by some editors who have the ability to propose files without mushhard.
I saw the price I paid Kobo, it's no regret.
I am afraid of the generalized abdication of users against the generalized approval of their private life.
In your large public library, you will note systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d*itre, ...).
There are also demanding executives whose opening and completion rates are undoubtedly disappointing.
For example, James Joyce’s “Finnegens Wake. ”
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to place all literature in the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo which are, not allowing or identifying readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information, to him.
There have been so many exaggerated, misleading and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a class of motherhood full of schizophrenia under acid.
It is even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some participants from Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they add your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to take a ball in the foot, unless it wins something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will recover, so it's actually taking a ball in the foot.
A diplomat wrote on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran has kept the United States and that it would be a mistake to seek to reverse Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because this would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a severe warning of arrests or simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprises us is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
Indian Punchline's reading is to strongly recommend that anyone pay attention to the details rather than to the c*neries balanced by traditional media. The short article you are giving you the link is important and should be kept in mind by the previous comments/warnings from Iran on a proposal from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who are seriously fighting the terrible Asian Assad and at the same time the evils of ISIS?
The pipeline policy moves the world towards ambition, and I would suggest that those who refer to “moderate” people who are not in the process of giving more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
"It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism." Does it have other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have a head.
It would require a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
“ Should ” ?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of being alive yet?
A little late for that, my bag...
Wouldn't the criminals be old-fashioned now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, huh?
Particularly with regard to the tripuvirate of the CUP that planned and directed genocide, Talat and Djemaal were killed just after World War I by the Armenians, and Enver was killed by the Bolsheviks in a quiet place in Central Asia near the same time, when he went to sleep to lay down a Turkish Empire.
That's the deal!
An impressive master of fatal penis sophism, but on the other hand, we seek out contact with the real.
It's like no argument.
The foot will always hear a heart that beats even in the belly of a pregnant mother.
The lesbian couples can be simply a desire for children and not a desire to be accepted.
The hetero hats, too.
What about the kids?
What a shame to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will be able to defend themselves, say that they are happy to live, earn their lives, and pay the woman's retirement (?)
GPA is certainly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of the medicine known to our world.
She doesn't date today.
Many women took and put children in the world who were not their husbands.
It's still that way, we're done like this...
What is important in this regard is that this practice is covered so that the "marking" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they also body marketing? !
Anakronic unit ...
It's certainly more exciting to make a good grow in a country far from the Internet and Pay Pal than to reduce its responsibilities and or avoid the scandal in another century near home without calling it at this time on all the waves! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who reject these practices ...
There is nothing left but the operation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh, look, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 70s in the Midlands, I've only seen that far.

But if you like this and you listen to music - this music today it's always so touching you.
I don't know why there are so many disturbing comments about what Paul Mason says, perhaps they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think that in the sports section there's an article on the foot that's waiting for your comments.
Great article, really.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a little bit of reporting that really reflects the reality of North England's culture.
No wonder that Paul Mason had well understood the social and political context, he understood things well.
Northern alone is still alive, but it has been vaccinated by capitalism and today is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That is what you can hear if you are in the region of London in November: 99pssoul is going to re-examine salt wines, including Northern soil, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here is a very written and well thought-out article.
your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy to have escaped from Newsnight.
Last train for Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and go down to Wallgate.
They're taking pills.
As soon as Wigan's car was Ince, 15 minutes after Wigan bought a ticket to stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Sun scene are described in an excellent episode of the series of police George Gently entitled Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming increasingly overwhelming.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misss an opportunity to take an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonizer (also, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He removes his clothes, puts them on the rock and enters the water.
An Israelite had wanted them.
The representative of Israel is angry and cries out: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time!"
The Palestinian Representative (UN) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the Palestinian authority's bipolar government and will not lower the guard ...
That this transfer to the anti-Israeli is evidence, it is not the purpose of research ...
Anticensionist: But I have answered you, I have translated: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always as long as politics is globalized...
No, no, no, no.
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it must be lost!
Don't answer for Israel's creation.
What force report has allowed Israel's creation?
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a strong report today!
You are in doubt ??!! ...
Besides, it doesn't only turn around Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have the evil to go beyond whatever he has to say.
Much of what he says is only written pseudo-chomskys written by others.
That's who proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a result of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly victorious burden, with just a suspicion of consciousness that Russell Brand said some truths, may be the truths we prefer not to think about.
Grow up, this feeling will be more recent!
I can understand why Brand is horrible at times: he sometimes speaks out with suspicion, and after all the absurdities of the tablets he actually gives the impression of being a starting populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it is right for people not to vote and rather to cross arms and ignore all the political process - but if you consider the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos that he has posted, it says that once every 5 years only for the Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to it is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) who are essentially in favour of private interests, multinational enterprises and wealth, A no time does it say simply ignore the policy because these parties do not rule in our name, and they do not think that they are guilty of it.
I do not say that I need to agree with its solution (because I think that being politically active in submitting his requests can go against voting, since politicians are politicians who will change their opinion if they really are at risk of losing the elections), but it's a joy to see all these convincing answers that this fool who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the pain of voting and just hope that everything is better because it's really the way to deform his arguments.
Its solution is extremely controversial and that would be true if people were to discuss what he actually said rather than simply label it as irresponsible and to address his concerns and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The vote was completely broken.
I am deeply upset that my vote does not really matter.
I want more referendums, e-vote, direct democracy and Members who take account locally of their electors.
In addition, I oppose the idea that Russell Brand's matters are not the senses (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own ideas and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and anti-stabilising universities over the counter-culture that Suzanne would want to group under the label "study-chomskys-labeled pseudo-chomskys".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and Russell interview on a veranda, with even the head raised on the mountain!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It is in a political discourse that has existed since generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - since generations.
This "fronde" reveals in my eyes that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDV of History where metier historians have become minority and where the exchanges of specialists have been in the interest of preparing dedicated sciences Po types for press files.
For my part, I saw in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take it to a condom, an emissary mouth.
They develop one another's very rational reasons, but this rationality is based on these exhilarating lips that are the key to their thinking.
Instead, I believe that the state was essential for Foucault as a prisoner.
This is a very archaic thought, the self-sacrifice thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the report to the other is solved by removing it.
There is an archiving, neo-lib and / or /liberator (for two terms the second mark is a triumph of the state's desire for irradiation , the first known to seek State aid for its markets ) within the meaning of the least of the State / not all of the State at Foucault .
The old dream of the foundation that is well organized.
Its opinion is based on the guilt of the State: without this guilt, it does not have any merit.
Who says bad, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
No other support.
The total left is remembered from the good old time, the one of his god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you have no doubt read a houya too fast if you have taken Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for a Khomeiny Apology.
Today, even Pierre Mannt wouldn't like to attack Michel this way...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary and collective individual, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, it is an original and respectful thinker.
See this cable orbited by researchers in human sciences on the left of the hard left, who do not bear that allegation to their minds, is quite likely.
Narcissism and authoritarianism of these people are unlimited.
An important point to add to me seems to be the position of these "rebellious" ones, which is not only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other young people I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't like to hear our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia - in the 1990s, last time in a market.
The Chinese think the same way about the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after the arrival of Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still understand some of them having anti-Blanc violence.
My father is not happy that his grown-up daughter comes out with a white.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s, especially during the last few years: they are more rich, prosperity spread out of big cities, and through this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I was told, the Russians were particularly vulnerable to temporary workers with no original qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in the Mediterranean and areas where they have a lot of chance of being exploited by their employees or facing high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the rivers of the Iinese River, Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' opinions on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really strange that an alien tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two in my life (including one abroad), did not keep bad memories, all people are proud and, in fact, those in London were very kind is the only reason I remember they were Chinese.
But we don't remember who we're meeting, all people go down, how to remember who we were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak of Chinese as a sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always come out with Ledit Blanc.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
No one, because there's a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would attack them PHYSIQUEMENT.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France that remains manipulated by strongly marked groups on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial environment is clearly marked by the right.
In the case of the Court of Justice, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its parity can be taken from the relevance of law enforcement in courts, it shall remove two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision as that of the actual interpretation of the Master.
It remains the required tool of the law to re-enter the evaluation on the basis.
The extent of its non-observance in all judicial acts of judges, including the power to make a distinction between the error and the partiality of the judges.
It would be wrong to assume that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
The claim and ignorance are not relevant for objective analysis.
So if all of this is not analysed, how can we say that justice improves in France?
If that's not just because statistics reveal that it's part of the bottom line.
The previous preambular column allows you to record clearly what follows in the third ratio.
The purpose of the corruption* of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nursing* which is attributed to the competent judicial institution of such a crisis.
The area considered is that of spoliation* of inheriteds committed to the process* by successive genoologists designated by notaries.
This profession is well earned in good year at EUR 150 million, while benefiting from coverage* provided by the almost taxable person* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part has been reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this combination presents statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many cases, differences between geneticists and geneticists who are reluctant to do so, all a set of judgments contrary to all the laws that are in favour of the heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics that ignores such reasonable criteria, then, a form of lie?
Prices must be completely prohibited.
More of the equipment to treat the disabled.
We can say this, but my brother has one of these tricycles all over the country, built on a measure of his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal rolling failure, with rough wheels and pneus, could not.
As we say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi is similar to what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tanker at the EPIQUE air.
I think that Whill's inventor never had to clean a dog's throat.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle everywhere, but it's just too expensive.
The long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for the longboard.
Here are some hills that would like them.
Prices seem to be really high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, so “you see.”
The tricycle all over the country seems especially useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance.
Only if they have become disabled.
The trick is that the rolling stock market is a niche, so they can practice high prices for things that they know they really need us.
We can't really say that Will is a minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a mistake, it's not intended to make it.
I'M CONTENT that the "long distance" error does not occur on the market, because there seems to be no way to drive this trick.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intense bombings in densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian Territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds spent their whole life in Israeli blocs!
The only situation in the world, unacceptable situation, also illegal situation, as this block imposes a "collective penalty" on all Gazans.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects turn a little bit of their stone into the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the language of wood, instead of concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Antithionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market there, there's some, and I recognize it.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
The only situation in the world is unacceptable for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded area: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) has excluded it!
Don't forget that after he got up, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I admit...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israel-Egypt ...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress built against the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've reflected well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, without a lucrative purpose.
Many are just looking for a couple of nights on Couchsurfing.
So it is to pay (or at least expect) in another way.
It's always much smaller than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who are trusted often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in species, thus touching Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
"What is it located on?"
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We do not use the word "your law" in the United States.
The author just used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, where you wouldn't notice.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, make sure it's 100% in accordance with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers to do business (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how rent (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, is really a hiding...
Did you think that the ships could be moved, flew and repeated, cooled, etc.?
The pennies are so slow as if someone tried to fly it would always be near where you left it.
Or turned off by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our pennies...
Where are you going to get it?
No Marine Le Pen's wrong!
Populism?
There is no truth but that one who exposes the facts!
Poverty is growing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the richest is a reality.
Who defends?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the month will be said!
Capitalism won't turn out!
The high financial, speculative, plays with our businesses, then our jobs, our primarys, so our purchases, our food, our care structures, our health, our debt, so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All of this benefited from some of the cold hyper-mega-obese.
Until the evidence of the contrary, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy, that's the money."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, the Economy Minister appointed an elder from Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of the bankers, alone responsible for the 2007 crisis.
There was no one else to compete?
You're calling this how: to return his clothes, to lower his pants?
Primary and populist response
We don't really know much about Marine Le Pen.
Where did you see this?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee's really "refused" to help survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that none of the parties seemed safe from the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cook in the area.
The sea was hot at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after the sun set, making all rescue operations more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malaunas, where, on the photos showing survivors in the course of safekeeping, we see a calm and full-day sea.
In addition, rescuers knew that there were no German combatants at this stage in the area.
Well, that doesn't really correspond to what I remember about this battle, so I did a quick research on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion arose among the German ships about the fate of the two curated cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped shooting, and a race race started.
Leipzig lives something in the fire, but as he approaches it, it's only a sword.
Nürnberg, slower than other German ships, join the Battle of Monmouth later and lives in the sky, thinks and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his projectors on the ship's deck, the proposal to return was rejected and it opened fire, finally closing the ship.
Without reliable information, by Spee judge that Good Hope had had to escape and stop searching at 22 p.m.
Concerned about reports indicating a British curator in the surrounding area, he headed north. ”
So, if that is true, the Germans, in the dark before the radar invention, did not know that a ship had crashed, and could therefore not find survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cure for the Royal Navy in the area that would have caused them serious damage, so in confusion they went down to benefit from their progress.
They were far from their base, and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them torture and had cost them about half their ammunition, condemning them when they were finally arrested.
Several votes are taken by the UMP to request that it be included in the law that a definitively condemned election is definitely inconceivable.
There's a brave position, which would also touch the left-hand side.
But noun, it's a lie.
For this idea, an Inscription is proposed to the death of the Council of Magistrates.
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this conflict between citizens be tolerated?
Keeped by policycards (es) where society's vision is limited to these sectors, it is always quick to love those who will take advantage of their immeasurableness to prevent the actions of true politicians, who are really trying to make things go wrong, not the beautiful speakers whose real estate is to the extent that they are sufficient.
I met them in the metro to the noon with their small pankarts for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Percy and POPB.
It supports the existence of political unions whose members have the enormous power to hold them in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right union, right-wing, right-wing, designated for the purpose of the personality of its board and led them to a legal-mediate war.
Your confirmations are completely free.
Yes, the right currently violates the judiciary's modernity is simply that it has committed the facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of the right person who had so much to do with justice, but all those who took care of him were not treated in favour.
On the other hand, it must be recalled that the union of the left-hand judiciary is not the only union of judges and that it is a minority.
That a minister supports with such commitment the unions show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you mention may be minority among the judges, but its influence is great in Chancellery, it is not a secret.
We are now asked whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more to go out than to teach.
@gos - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that the judges are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to accuse and imprison each other.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the weakest of glory realizes that X-factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have been used as a tromplin to start a successful career.
The One Directorate is filling the stages of the world.
Others have then sold a lot of disks or are part of West End.
Popstars, the director of all these programs, launched Creyl Cole, who is actually part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, have all made the Eurovision competition, as many others.
While others, such as Frank Sinatra and the rest, have participated in U.S. competitions.
In the 70s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen in the dark.
But this is what happens in any way to most stars who do not participate in competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in doing this to others.
In any way, most of the singers/groups can best expect three albums and one of the best.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity is part of his marriage with a football player who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to take off on a career than the typical walk of rock, even if in your dream you think that all the flowerers who smoke the tree in their father's garage and balance three agreements at a level of primary school will certainly become stars and the only question is how they want to touch even before an album is released.
And rather than ridiculous: it creates a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us as far away as infinity superstitious and ritual bigotiate petrities, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to us and inspired, like us, to practical considerations of everyday life.
Except you're imprudently interpreted in an inverse way.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is damaged by sacred character, should it not be better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières also have a little sacred character?
Our way is as reminded of seeing the sacredness as a well-defined form of object and is devoted to the religious sphere.
The article is very interesting whatever it is.
It's the deco ephemera to get rid of the empty.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of Illustrative Figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of holiness is always alive.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would be passed on to the Ords of any scientist who lives on a mandarin, rarely less.
When's a similar criticism of discipline for a little adjustment?
Because what is needed for archeology is also for interpretations that give other disciplines.
This would lead to a dose of healthy moderation.
Your archeologists are really unjust!
It is thanks to them that we have constantly discovered treasures, valuable evidence to restore history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archeology is fascinating.
This method is not very old, and before the archaeologists knew their "instinct" and their knowledge, they could be mistaken.
In our day there are so powerful technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the caves is better but can always be caused by other discoveries!
It is there in full (and old) Polish on the chamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (including his book "The Names of the Prehistoric", particularly the increased edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La House des Roches).
Thank you for this hard-instructive article
Heterobic men love anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put it on.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't continue to three?
This journal is meant to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canyon?
No, but we're not against a theater room above.
We couldn't look at a musical comedy up there in reverse, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment from you.
We'd say Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Because your trial offer is almost over, then I suggest you pass to Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedo.
Let me suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, courageous, so that they write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and losses.
It's more than making fun of these chicken-sucking buns.
Not very bad.
Come on, then.
If you're so shocked by these "pulls" you're not obliged to participate, aren't you?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is possible to make both and publish an article on the annual sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or does it make people regular?
Nevertheless, we find the amazing video of crash on the net...
A love video of crash on the net...?
If the FOM chose not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in any case from the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, she would have gone out of safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. unladen) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon we knew it had arrived, but for which the FOM had not decided well to advance the time of departure (telephone law, pub, money...).
But on the other hand, they're protecting the pilots.
Well, I'm also sharing this opinion.
But there is also the fact that if the very British FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to fight the English who was then...
You're on this blog of my sister Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to exploit all your c***** rice.
No, just not.
There were positions of speculation in F1, but never one who threatened the Commissioners to die for a long history of the possibility of defeating a pilot to the destruction of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of safety because it's the FIA.
Well, that's a little bit of a size.
In view of amateur images, the absence of image allows the FIA to avoid the gensive questions of the type: How does the Commissioner act a green team in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the complete video after the accident)
No, this is not because the video is judged too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because it is clearly seen by one of the Commissioners acting as a green team, it means that the course can normally resume and that it is more under the yellow team regime.
Some comments show a summary of F1's mecokinism.
Yes, dear Etienne, the course is no longer under the regime of yellow teams APRES the place of the accident, where the green team is organized.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of Commissioners just below the accident (in the case, it may be 10 metres as 100 meters after the accident) activates the green to tell pilots to take a normal walk.
Sensationalism sells the pub.
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I was afraid that, in the end, it was just for money.
And sex, we don't forget sex, the fear of having no sexual life, the public and the media are good for us to sell things that seem to improve our sexual life.
The information is exactly the same.
Making the buzz with information that we don't really need to worry about is right to keep people afraid so that they can continue to control them.
"When the tables touch about Ebola, we all find the fear "It should be "dry" not "tossed".
Given the medical reference, “all” is better to say in this context than “reject. ”
I wonder if all those who claim that Ebola might be spreading by air are aware that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too proud.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse that approaches.
Ebola is the antichrist!
You're confused with Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concious article that reticulates this pseudo-journalism seriously and firmly.
That made me very hard.
This makes me feel that the media are talking about most of the things with this optimism in the world.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently fraternised and angry (without reaching the history) for the government to make us disappointed when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to rise up a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attention, why don't we have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he himself has invented.
Is there nothing fundamentally problematic about the idea of rule by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for being still in this world nearly 35 years later.
In addition to the beginning, this must have been horrible, seeing the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffy, living with the certainty of passing it for years..
Witnessing perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the evidence serve nothing: they take only, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of facts.
@trafic: The evidence cannot serve as scientific material.
This may be the reason why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatric care when reliable observations are made from close relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother psychiatry explains that I was taught telepathically by her beautiful mother.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's a mistake, it's a subjective witness without any importance.
Ah, because the proof of a fact (= here is this evidence, which confirms the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is nothing in a scientific approach?
What are you looking for, then?
On ghosts?
Do you have the same level of fantasy theory and facts (= giving a place to verifiable evidence) ?
"Resilience": the word bedoned by the great mothers, fans of J-L Delaree, who are taken for great psychologists after having a D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of buzzwords live meanings in psys.
Cyrulnik made us the cut of the "resilience".
As it is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have broken us into a reliable scale of measure for quantification, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company?
Don't you think of Team America?
Seriously, this isn't a good idea to use Air Sentinels...
So why?
It was a great series, and it would be said that those who come out of it have a conscience!
So let's leave our health to the power that can perform miracles.
But how are they going to make children grow up?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humour kind of pippi-cata, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
Children grew up.
Ah, because it's a series for children?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So watch your American team.
Every day in Supermarition?
This won't be the same if we don't see the children and the animation is well done. :-)
I hate to see this (although it's an adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of redistribution of the old.
The series has almost never stopped being spread here in Australia; it takes at least 40 years to have episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 06 p.m.
Since the arrival of the free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes are now at 5:30 a.m. Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a 60-year-old bad guy, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the planets!!!
The radical Zionists have invented this to give political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In addition, all the Israeli caves below and around the skyscrapers for several decades have not been allowed to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists there is another.
Can it be Argentina?
This mountain has not been searched for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the moustache floor was built.
It's the summation, or the Queen of Rocher, that makes it out in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Mahomet is raised to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, this is Mount Moriah, where Abraham sacrificed his son Isaac.
From the time it was taken and contextualized, there was no propaganda, but information, i.e. K1K1.
Israel is also aware of its extremists, it is good to remember them regularly, and they are unfortunately related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter has accepted the plan to 2 states, and has succeeded in continuing!).
It is also good to show how far Jerusalem's accession is not a peaceful fact.
Would God recognize the six?
The shortest of Jewish blogs: "God be praised!"
In order to avoid tourism in Israel, we are often shown by young babies to half the dead, naked on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what we show advertising, as we can see about the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary at the same time.
And this photo is a great campaign work!
The damage that Reuters's photographer had not taken in photos of hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and prefer to throw the faithful Jews into the counterbas, praying at the Wall of Distresss.
@Mat, If this photo offends you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's not the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she sends to condemn.
This system is not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to bring an end to this system is to revolution.
Since the economy seems to be in decline, large companies have greatly benefited from their employees.
They were able to convince their employees that they had the chance to have a job and that they could not afford to increase their wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave more important rewards to the small elite at the summit.
You're right, it's not sustainable, but it's going to change in this country only when workers speak truly of one voice.
Instead of laughing and laughing when someone else makes the noise, support them, prove some solidarity and understand that their grief is not only about their problems, but also show your employer that people are not being punished.
Unless we give up democracy, if you do, it's boring.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All of this can't be done very well.
That's because we're in democracy that it has.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the benefits of the companies held by these people in the short term by national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism is for investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the agreement.
The Greens are opposed to this project and try to warn people about the inimical damage that this agreement will have in our lives.
This is just what we recently started to talk about in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Watch these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your home.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sister and tears"?
That's who makes excellent returns, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on trees.
The next low mail will certainly be the car market.
This monsieur was right, at the 18th, there were unions in all systems.
In the very French Catholic army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (finally, her officers, others, no one knows anything) believe in France's eternal value buffer, and she beats and closes her throat.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, short: the dissoluteness of the nation's idea, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's more uncomfortable...
You still lack the union of married men, celibates, married women, celibates, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write French correctly, I agree.
You've been prevented, that's your fault.
In order to defend the categories of interests, there has already been a sufficient level of protection of trade unions, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the fear of the risk of a member of the staff member.
We can well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right to cry like in Germany, in contrast to the protection they enjoy.
Unsustained disaster.
And with the charters that prepare, the government is pleased.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance and Effect...
I was unaware of Sybile's ignorance, and I was alarming the military and other officials, because this is the issue here mentioned...
"by means of his delegates" is deleted in article 8 of the 1946 Constitution.
He will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as the management of businesses."
This is absolutely necessary with the interruption of the information power.
And yet you opened it, of course, then comment specifically on an article entitled "The Great British Back Off Review". ???????????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought he had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's marriage that I've looked at, and I can tell you that some have been well murdered.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage there is one of the best moments (which was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the tart mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time affiliate that, strangely, the issue ends with a victory of the worst blower; no one has ever done a "boum, here's my bag of butter now blow it up and point it in front of your master!"
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents out there eventually had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outside persons were kept separate.
And there's also this idea of "to play security, there's always next week" that goes away last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm influenced by it.
I am grateful to those who make it and thus offer us a great fun and motivate us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree that the last challenge of last year, the wedding feast, was absurd.
Professionals generally set up days to do them and had to break up at 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to get started, and I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only true fault they could have found was that the base was a little dry (even if I agree with Hollywood to say that Richard's green glaze did not want, Richard had already lost at this time).
I need to know that several challenges in this series appear to be a little artificial because of the time spent.
There's also the cancer that looks at, with the cuts of solar wind.
Certainly, we all succeed at this time.
A bad time to pass for humanity, we hope for it.
You freeze solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
The UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed directly by the impact of the residual solar wind particles and the UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to "shape" the stratospher ozone.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and cancer.
Fortunately, the ozone layer doesn't block the UVs.
They have a task of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to man, they are interested in allowing us to have oss (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (except infrayouges), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morality.
The ozone layer blocks the cancerous UVCs and lets the UVs and most UVBs pass.
Do you know that you are not required to be consensual and consider your interlocutor as a stay when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was heard in the commentary, which he himself heard in evidence of pedagogy.
Without saying I'm a melanoma habit, UVs only make it easier to adapt to its development.
They won't do it.
To prove: not all people burned have no melanomas.
Either, when a tube tells you that you need to avoid the sun and live on the ground of a cave, it's better not to listen because UVs are needed for everyone.
The exception, on the contrary, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
The UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we wash it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested have found that everything can be washed if a sufficient force is applied and iPhone 6's robustness is perfectly acceptable, for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resistant and that's why it hasn't adopted iPhone6 as a first-line communication material.
But for the rest of us,
That's a good choice.
the majority of those interested have found that everything can be washed if a sufficient force is applied.
Except for Nokia and Nokia 3310.
More precisely, is it already rained?
This blog is made in every discussion.
I decided to tell them.
It's the fourth blog on the page that I read in today's comments.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you can imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and you can see how bad it could get back there.
Therefore, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been correctly installed and is therefore compatible with the installed tool test code.
I don't know how they do these tricks.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photos on Ebay clearly show the absence of the FCC logo or CE and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah the article for bobo by excellence.
We want little expensive products and we wonder that industrial products are produced in »industrials' We put the top of you, but all the teachings and even the small trade are related to how to buffer well, bio avac 1650€ (average in France)?
But to answer your job, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to set his priorities where he understands it.
For me, food is one.
Go without a ring, I'll kiss you.
They are called bobos, or better boboecologists, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that makes them want to connect with reality.
It's the total grouping of reasoning.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example, claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
He is also an expert in tartuferi, accompanying the left-caviar, which they are sometimes above, for example by condemning CO2 rejections while spending their vacations in Maldives.
The vast majority of our conceptions do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferia, nor are they surprised to meet frequently criticisms on their subject.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and extensive theory and for all the details associated with it (air, shower...).
I'd like to share it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecles are monoblocks.
Did you understand the concept of the left-handed?
And you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the schools soon.
The boboecolo is actually part of it, but it does not represent the most visible fraction of the echoles because it is the one that infects the media.
That's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in the face.
She's so bad that she looks like a naked woman.
Chut, you're on the side of the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of the art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you just didn't have any legitimacy to make a comment because you haven't been able to study and flag large artists for many decades.
The important thing is that Emin doesn't know how to draw and seems to be always obsessed by the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really succeeded in becoming very rich and famous with no artistic capacity.
That's "l'art."
No, it's from the kitchen.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a fact.
It's rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is real dog reproductions that smoke by playing on the billard.
To judge the art may be problematic, but not in this case.
Design, it's better than just represent the real.
If you're looking for only that, a photo device will do the case.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of design you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still a need to make economies: riding activities, the number of horses of the republican guard or the status of the generals who are no longer in active service....
L(unity requires that France reduces its effectiveness, but, as has been done by all countries, sometimes more drasticly, to begin with Britain.
It's just half encouraging...
The operator without the support, it's quick to find its limits!
A unique approach, at the time when we observe the weaknesses, the weaknesses of our defence tool, particularly in Sahel.
A bad cut for the local communities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, wants a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: That's what I said, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at me, at me it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, to see where the gobegie is certain.
That all those who had little or enough of the military thing should come here, the eyes in the eyes that no money has been stored in this perimeter and this without uncluttered smile...
The same trend across the public function and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really cold: look at the inflation of public employment in other departments and you will understand why The Defence may appreciate a little charge!
Well, the economies on which everyone agrees to say that they have to be done, even though this is something, isn't it?
Lack of power, those on whom it fell are the killers when it comes to them, the poor in love.
It should be done, but above all, it doesn't bother me because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
In closing the Grace Val will weaken our defense tool in Sahel?
For local communities, history repeats each closure of post, maternity, hospital, household.
But the whole world is for the well-known economies.
It is strange that a major UMP wants compensation and does not enjoy economies in public spending.
This article is truly the most exciting trick I've ever had!
This is the moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad mistake.
It's the pressure to defecate her son Facebook and to see that 80% of her friends began their status by the phrase “This moment’s Embarrassing. ”
I think they're gonna make a movie.
It will certainly be based on exciting scenes where someone falls by haired on his ex in the bus on his way to work and only finds out where his jump is back in his pocket.
It's not touching, it's totally with you.
Not really, I think the author takes the role of the typical British man who has always learned to lift his emotions and close his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
Don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe what point this article is the most incredible trick I've ever read!
Charlie's really come to show that he's still at the top of the cosmic universe that it's satirical journalism!
I'll take it back!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they will finally be able to shed light and discover the incredible clarity and insurprising genius that penetrates Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if it's not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive change in democracy: the amount of regional policies and effective associated initiatives.
Until the new order, we acknowledge the right to save our planet by States that play the tarts at each meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they planted energy, all these good recommendations were included ....
Translate : Solar Eoliennes and firmas are the Round points tomorrow.
All financed by the co-tribal.
Please stop this pro-nucleary speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more fragile at the level of its losses and in the event of an accident.
As long as the filter is not mastered in its integrity, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided we are clearly aware of the drastic reduction in our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear power is a zero CO2 emission for production and epsilon for other stages.
The electricity by the renewable oil or PV is already more than GES on the other steps, and especially on gas, or worse than carbon as in Germany, to compensate for intervention.
Replaceing the nuclear fuel with the renewable oil or PV will result in the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult myself as a State Doctor in physical science 1981 more than I did nuclear physics research I'm trying to prove it against what I said.
For what I didn't say is that you're giving me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany in fact you didn't answer what I said, and like all the people who are entitled to cancel the interview I never do.
I also refer to the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: the current renewable energy programme of Germany is an ineffective and ineffective way to reduce GES emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not account for the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the gas pipeline to be less effective than the CO2, it is true that the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant is part of the water tank and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "Gehent of South Asia"!!!
Last time, Pakistan won against India.
This is not surprising to me, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it clearly shows your mental state.
It would have been the same if they had qualified the South Asian gegent India...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafiosio.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was extremely interesting, Kolkata's Athletics imposed 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how can we ever revalid ourselves with our "wounding neighbors"...
The course at the low cost runner pays cash.
It hurts for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the absence of possible design shows only with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a lack of design, but to implement...
contrary to arianaspace, which is a private company, it seems well that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurance.
They'll be able to pay for the satellites in frigates who know..
This is so much easier than many media take the only titles of articles - and that many readers consider these titles only.
In general, this creates a mistaken impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
As you agree, the title is not appropriate, it is wrong to cause the project while it is only a problem with launch.
