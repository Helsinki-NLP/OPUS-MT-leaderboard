I had doubts.
I had read this book last week.
I was right about you.
I had a special morning at 7:00.
I had repaired Boston many years ago.
I had good intentions when I asked him to talk.
I had some unexpected information.
I had a little free time, so I decided to exchange it around the city.
I had a hard day.
I had a hard time.
I had a good idea.
They had become employees.

I asked a lot of questions.
I did my job.
I thought I was asleep.
I've been looking at them.
I had three hours to get out of Boston here.
He was cold at night.
Did he get cold last night?
He did a lot of shit with a very small half.
"Did you do this Monday?" "No, I didn't."
You made the same mistake again.
You made a lot of mistakes.
You made a lot of mistakes.
You made the same mistake.
Did Tom do anything?
He made the same mistake twice.
He did tea.
I got my knife.
I got the card.
You got the card.
There you can't go.
That's not enough.
That's not white.
Those lips are big.
She's not my wife.
She's my wife.
That photographer is very talented.
That's a ship.
That was my box.
He gave it to me.
That student is Tom.
That student is Tom.
That house is much better than that.

That book is written in French.
That box is bigger than this one.
Is that the mollusc is yours?

Come home tonight, let's say at 6:00.
Did you say...?
I'm checking my e-mails.
They hope that a metric response will prevent further violence.
I hope the road with the car isn't heavy.
I hope they find Tom.
I hope he'll be back soon.
I hope he'll be back soon.
I hope you didn't tell her.
I hope I don't interrupt you.

One of Tom's kids lives in Australia now.
One of Tom's kids lives in Australia now.

A person more or less does not make a big difference.
A car hit Tom.
One more step, and I'd have been gravitated.
One more step and I'd have fallen off the grid.
We want one.
A good dress ensures a meeting but a good mind a meaningful relationship
A part of the public officials' share is cancelled.
A small step for man, a giant wave for humanity.
A little trick in front of the scene is natural before a funeral.
A Greek, please.
A Greek, please.
We want one.
Another world is powerful.
