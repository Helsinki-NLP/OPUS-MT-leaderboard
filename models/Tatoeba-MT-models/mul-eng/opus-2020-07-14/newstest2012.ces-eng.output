Parliament did not support the new liberationist Timorese
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament has refused to amend the proposal under the new criminal law of the paragraph on which the opposition of Julia Timoschenk was judged.
The correction which would open the way for the release of the imprisoned extremists was rejected in the second reading of the proposal for a reduction in the penalties for economic disputes.
In October, Timoschenk was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly incapacitated contract with Russia on the purchase of landfill.
The judgment is not lawful, the appeal of the accused shall be held in the hearing.
Timoschenk points out the judgment of the political party of the regime, the suspicion of the court's involvement also prompted the process in the West.
It was suggested that paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on which the extremist had been assessed, should be supported in the vote of 147 Members.
His approval required 226 votes.
Libya’s Victory
The time of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddáfi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him after the war.
There's still a definition of victory.
As is common in the country, the elections welcome Islamists, but it's whether to die or radically.
The Transitional National Council has reported to the ordinary court and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because for stealing hands are cut off.
Women may forget the emancipation, the possible deviations from the faith waiting for correction and so on.
The place of the dictator's people will be the company of the opposite tribes to join the crown.
In Libya there will be a series that we cannot imagine and which we would definitely not want.
Just because our way of life is not the only one, neither objectively the best and most likely, it would not be necessary to address the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it is with the belief that the Islamic warriors took refuge with the help of unbelieving dogs.
The only regret is that, in their view, NATO has not directed any general from America, rather than Alah, whose size has been praised in every respect.
So when they're looking for victory in Libya, the west of them doesn't belong.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies saved the political union in the dictator's person, without guaranteeing any benefit.
After all the bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we don't buy military goods.
The local crash is a problem with the removal of the crystals.
But they're going to have a bunch of bad companies for a bunch of Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough and the West will finally be able to exploit the inevitable protection of human rights.
So if you don't tell us that, you know, you know, the law of magic.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe reached investors
Statistics of deaths were passed across Europe in the afternoon.
The United States has published information on HDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has grown dramatically, Germany and France have grown.
The long-term market, but today's a record market.
Investors are not only in Italy but also in Spain, France, Austria and elsewhere.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary reports on economic development in the third quarter.
HDP Germany grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, the two countries managed data for a second quarter, in which Germany compared to better than expected (increased by 0.3% instead of 0.1%) and France therefore indicated that it appeared in a mild decline of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of the year.
On average, however, the gross domestic product (HDP) stood and according to the ČSU thus confirmed the trend of progressive slowdown in economic efficiency.
The results are worse than the results of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of the year, but it grew by 12 per cent.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to pre-primary and seasonal data.
The euro area economy and the European Union are growing by 0.2 per cent against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent in the course of the year.
Their 10-year debt is 28.45%.
The effects of Italian and Spanish debt increase to critical limits.
Problems also begin to feel like Rakousko, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The exports in the Czech 10-year debt are under 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, the ECB is voting in favour of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
In the Black Mountains they won 1:0 and celebrated the process for 200 million
Photovoltaic representation of the most difficult task of the season!
In the Black Mountains and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful Peter Jiráčka brand, it was 1:0.
The Czech football and with a large share of luck in the second half of the year, the luxury jump from home will no longer be missed on the European champion.
IHNED.cz has been monitoring progress in the detailed report.
Almost no explosions in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech representative and thanks to the home of the late Czechs, the great Czechs and the Croatians of Yiračk welcomed in Montenegro 1:0 and praised the process of European mystery.
Because of the precise weapons of the Czech Republic, the black people were under pressure until the second half of the year.
The mobs became Damjanovic and the Vuchinič, who slept two large shots.
And thanks to the great Peter Czechs such a Czech representation or the next year will not miss the mystery of Europe, it adds 200 million crowns to the treasure of the Tuscan football.
He's been playing a lot of war football since the first minutes.
The two teams just joined together and played seriously around the semi-trailer.
The pressure of domestic footballists and therefore did not arrive in the first half, a long cover for the defense of the Czech defence has been completely removed.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They've created a living shield.
Several hundred high schools have created a living shield around the nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in the afternoon in front of the object and then celebrated the deaths of the United States and Israel.
Several of the students of the University of Iran in Isfahan were created in an internship near the Isfahan nuclear technology center in which the uranium is processed.
They make it so clear that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that Iran did not stop fighting nuclear weapons as a whole.
A possible attack on the Iranian nuclear plant is addressed in Israel.
The students prayed in the afternoon before entering the Espahan nuclear plant and then celebrated the deaths of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to protect the Iranian nuclear programme would be, in addition to the Israeli press, also to the target of the device in Natanzu, where the uranium is cultivated.
A child’s obese diet: no breakfast and dinner served
More than a third of the children between the ages of 9 and 13 have two problems, with an excess of 9 percent of school and obese are 5 percent of the children.
Obese children come from most of the family with a healthy lifestyle, as shown by the current study.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows and the patterns it covers.
For example, in obese children, up to half the time in children with normal breast-feeding.
The reduced meals had no more than 19 per cent of obeses during the day before the study related to the global action called Obesita.
It is also not unusual to play in the families of the disabled, which is also related to most families of today’s schools - only 15 percent of the children replied that their parents will find time at least once a week to move.
A study of 900 children
A study was conducted at the end of the late school year and attended with 900 children from basic schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was no longer the second anniversary of the action of Obezita, which supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand schools from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Proper care and sufficient movement within the family is one of the determining factors that enables dramaticly the number of children with double or even obese.
"Only half of the questions asked, for example, indicated that she was five times a day in the breakfast-sacrifice-night meal regime, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper living," says one of the results of the study.
No breakfast and dinner
The Committee notes that there are essential and relative details for healthy development, including the need for regular family breakfasts.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the school families are hungry at the same time.
Most families eat each other.
And the worst thing was to find out that in the tenth of the house, she doesn't even wake up at all.
Breakfast is the basis for proper daily meals.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, they are more likely to consume unhealthful meals.
Almost every - no matter how much - drinks every day sweet lemonade (70 per cent).
The network regularly plays more than 40 per cent of the children asked, and the result was less than half - 15 per cent in their parents.
Get your food set up.
Another part of the study enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up their own food according to their own taste and opinion.
"Serving preferences for Czech children 12 to 15 years of age are far from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of molluscs, fats, and sweet meats.
"Alarming is particularly a large range of sweet lemonades," says the final report to the study.
For lunch as the main food, the testicles were carefully over the driver.
But the children actually didn't want to be hungry, and it's also low-forming fish and sundry vegetables.
A Healthy Approach
The study also showed that children are willing to adjust their diet if they get the right information.
"In the control group of the researchers who completed the questionnaire after the end of the world presentation, Obezita is not an accident, in a number of cases there has been a clear degree of preference to the principles of healthy living," the results of the project are quoted.
It was marked, for example, in sweet lemonades where more children would take advantage of traditional water.
Children are also more often caught in the question of cattle and fish as the main food of the day and would mix sweet foods and vegetables.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, a firm profession.
In the opening article on how to learn stylists, I felt so little that it was already a lot in the early hours.
I didn't know what to follow.
Presentations of three trials from the camp, clothing of problem posts and seminar on how it goes on.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course runs every Saturday and doesn't work, it's really "fucking."
This time we met with Director Allenko (in the course there's no one else) how to dress up a woman who has no perfect balance.
And most of them are serious.
Someone's got a short church, someone else's gonna stand up for a boy without a proper hug, and someone's going to go over it again.
The stylist needs to know how optically to replace the wide shoulder, prolong the church or add the necessary curves.
We've got guys like Jennifer Lopez's woman, and then bigger breasts and arms and a pretty dog, they'll get pretty excited and at the same time don't look too challenging.
If, for example, the difference between the pasta and the leaves is such that the juices or potatoes do not actually sit, then the payment will be allowed to hear at least one such kiss for peace.
You're definitely not going to regret it because the perfectly boring clothes are not paid.
You will feel much better in the peace zone than in the one who keeps on fighting, avoids, stays in the gang, and so forth.
A boy's position may also be allowed to wear clothes with drawings, applications, liftings or pickings.
Such information and types of statement are of course a lot, so I'm glad I've had a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm also afraid that considering the assigned homework is until now.
Each of the courses has received a dedicated celebrity that has to think of two expenses: day and night.
We need to take into account the current view, the fashion style of the person concerned and the type of position.
I'm going to dress Miranda Kerr's, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit I am, certainly better for me than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently collected about a hundred pounds (beautiful, please, at the top), or young Selena Gomes.
We have to print clothes from magazines or look for the Internet and print and then work graphics.
Moodboard, as the whole result is said, will also express our personal style and relationship to the graphic creation.
Reflecting on the graph page of the styling is also important.
The stylelist does not only dress physically, but also creates similar product pages in newspapers (for specific tasks, for example trends in cables, cables, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's Sunday.
The stylelist must have a general look
The Saturday presentation, accompanied by information on the types of accommodation, was immediately stopped by three guests from the camp.
Stylelist Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that the fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a sleek stylist can work with one suit of clothes different.
Variability is key in this case.
So you should have such a touch (or if you want to start trunchcoat) you can wear classics over the jeans and tricks like a plate, but you can also wear it on the whole body, both boat and paint as a suit.
Or it's enough to hold hands or lips, and then the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly at work."
"Well, you can start breaking them," said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we're going to stick to all the lessons that we're going to combine with, why, why, even in fashion magazines, we can see something else.
He's not even talking about reviews.
Thanks to Ben's photographers, I also know that the stylist has to have a lot more options to wear than they're going to take.
So in the fashion story that will have ten pages (that is, ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "discover" at least fifteen.
And also that it looks and works in combination with other cookies completely different from in fact.
That's why we have to count the cost.
That the image and style are making a lot of luck, the Honza Pokorny confirmed to us.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which's not exactly an amazing singer, but images and marketing from it made the world's old.
In Czech, access to the use of stylist services is still colder.
And the famous faces of it look like something else. (It's quite opposite that I can do something, that's how I look at it.)
And if someone's already leaving us to create a styling, then we have to calculate that with a great probability, he's quantified a completely different (lower) size than he really does.
Then it doesn't have to go up and find out if the bull didn't write about that the day celebrate was tired/dwelling and similar.
Honza and Mario told us on Sunday that it's not enough for the stylists to focus on the fashion and the art of spending the cost.
He first communicates with people who dress, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
It's the ability to turn people away, not to surrender, to stand up for their own views.
"When you are ordered by a manager to beat her with a knife and fill her with a beautiful shirt, you can't shake her whole neck and say, "God, it's a joke."
"You can find at least some things that you admire and recommend for what they're going to wear," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything should contain the so-called "placovka" or a bottle on the plate.
It's the one you hang around the passport and you have all the property you need.
In addition to clear things such as knifes, towels or towels, there is also a silhouette (and the stylist will help with the focusing of products such as cables or clasps), special clips that we cover behind the clothing, if it is larger (spending or other shoes are not available, cut off by clothes), or tight.
To not only listen but also try something practical, we learned how to properly cover the buttons.
Even when you're focusing on the office, where there's the right surface, the floor could be damaged and then out.
And that's how we dress and dress.
We can't even touch our legs so they don't hurt each other.
So there's a real need for generosity.
Mario comforted me when he praised my creation without exception.
The reduced generosity is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we've heard about the second weekend of the course.
I'm starting to be as clear as ever as I'm about to win a styling at a professional level. It's really not a rosy farm walk to say what anyone wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run is running all over America.
Review
Initially, an old-fashioned drive with the whole series of extreme icebreakers changes in the routine early road on the ice.
Ambice is going to be a big deal, but it's not worth anything if nobody apparently wanted to do anything more.
A new section with the title The Run was built before the issue of high expectations.
He promised that the flight of the race series needed for speed again played a new direction and played as a game that would not only be counted in the game genre.
We have also been aware of the appropriate steps in which the main gate will come out of the car and run after them.
But as in the NFS series, there's a lot of results that's different from what we've been waiting for.
These are potentially sound archaic competitions, but the whole is going down a few more serious errors that appear in the series for several years.
So it's actually not even a mistake, but it's more of a show of some unintelligent forest of the developers.
Welcome begins very well.
You are mentioned in the story that Jack's main hero has certain personal problems, and as a solution, he is involved in an illegal race towards America.
As a volunteer, you will sit on the western coast of San Francisco and your mission is to reach New York.
The idea with you is a few interesting things.
The trasa is divided into ten stages, and then into more than ten competitions.
As a result, each race is on another track and these stages are based on different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
The man doesn't even have a moment to feel that the game would always offer the same thing.
Some of the mediums are much more nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a global thing.
But the journey towards the desert, the southern region or the high in the snowy mountains makes visualally very pleasant.
The competitions are more time-consuming with some non-typical first.
In the desert, for example, you are accustomed to a singing battle that significantly decreases visibility.
On the contrary, you need to be careful again so that you don't get caught by a whale.
According to this, they're pretty good for each other.
They're just a couple of guys, but it's enough.
For a while you try to predict the required number of opponents (mainly a classic race), then you get the time (classic file with feet) and then you have to wait for one match.
Until then, you've been involved with the police for a while, and you've been getting even more upset about your efforts.
The newspaper's on the way out of the car.
It's just more about such interactive animation when Jack's most of them are in front of someone and you need to help him in that way so that at the right time, you print the right button.
Nothing complicated.
But it's surprising that these puzzles are in the game much less than you would expect (in particular, perhaps only three).
As a result, this is only a promotion, because this element has no chance of becoming an easy one and in the context of the above mentioned, it is so similar to the ones that the game ceases.
The driving model goes in the steps of the previous parts.
That means it's probably not a girl today, but it can't be said that it would be closed.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you'll have to look into the others.
However, the more practical driving model is still quite good, although we can find better in competition.
Until then, it's all in plain order.
The problems, but they start to appear after a while.
Unlike the vehicle model, it's not quite all right anymore.
From this type of game we don't expect it to count complex deformations and wheels, but if you actually don't have at least the feeling that your car is being kept, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you're driving a tight drive or switching a car in the ordinary drive, you're sometimes just going to get a little bit more light, but sometimes in almost the same situation, your car ends in wild pirates.
Or even a fair attack.
Thanks to the system of reboots, it's not particularly wrong, but it's going to get you out of the way.
The restarts are solved so that if you slow down or walk away from the track, it will take you back to the last catch point on the track.
Only five are available in each race.
When you take it out, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's better to help if something doesn't happen than you can deal with it.
Sometimes, though, even reboots do not help, it is better to learn to remember this step of the race.
The big difficulty of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some barriers need to be designed in a specific way, or you will not be able to see them briefly.
Once again, you'll be in a given "civil" vehicle always in the same configuration until you get there first, fifth, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is especially true in situations where you see that between the two antiquated cars will easily pass before you, while when you arrive there, the vehicles are already in such a condition that you have to drive or drive them.
It's one when you get to it, because it's "calculated" so that it's always coming straight before your nose.
Surprisings have another advantage.
Throughout the time of the game, you will find several places where you, no matter how much time you have, always face the same opponent at the same place.
Most of the time, it's empty at the end of the game at the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to get in front of you, apparently, at any price.
When it comes to your front, it will cause you to lose sight of the opposite vehicles, so at first you may be able to make a good start.
In order to understand the purpose of making the game more exciting and adrenaline, it's so obvious that it's going to slow you down as soon as possible.
And it's a shame, because even through a simple driving model is playing fun and places and so active that you can't always watch where it hurts.
And it's basically one, whether it's about the concept with dozens of unique trajectories, sorting the races so that the offer doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
A non-traditional idea is a change in a car during a race.
You need to pay attention to gas pumps on the road, because you can change the car right there, although in most cases you will be able to cope with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sporters are suitable in urban areas, strong American boroughs on the same road and exotic supersports on the technical circuit, for example on clicks of mountain roads.
The main story mode is hand in hand and way of challenge, which are the races in the individual places you know from history.
Here you get not only medals but also experience points into your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
To achieve a higher level of drivers, various items are removed: start cars and end with background for profile.
It is also proposed again with the Autolog function, which in turn compares your results to other players and has other community functions.
One of the other difficult puzzles is the situation from the last race in history.
With your car you'll get to the tunnel of meters (a building) where you're married in the dark after the next (a building).
At the tachymeter, you look at the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (budj) and then the rear of the metro adjustment and does not miss you.
In writing, we'll probably still have a few more days to discuss whether no one really thought about the game, or whether the authors really have us so big.
The technical page of the game is not extra, but at least the overall visual memory is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It smells like some more exciting moments, and it's pretty tragic in some cases.
However, this is especially true of the majority of participants when you don't have the same amount of money as your filmmakers.
The sound page is fine and soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an effort to please what the oldest scale of the younger audience has produced soundtrack from the category "every dog other than everyone", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music the game will probably not be bought by someone like that.
The entire village of Need for Speed: The Run is so detached.
If the game were to create all the remaining mistakes, then we wouldn't be able to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
But that's the way the game works.
The fun is certainly fine, but be prepared to get you lost in the eyes of the air reflectors.
Songs UK attends the concert Students of the Samet
The Union of the win of the International Day of Study and the Year of the Summer Revolution with a musical experience already offers the festival of the Festival of Academics.
During that time, he will be presented at the twenty secondary and secondary schools.

"The University of Karl's has a big part at the festival."
"The Pévec Congregation of the Pedagogical Schools and the Faculty of Humanitarian Studies is among the participating congregations, in the Festival Committee of Directors of Václav Hampl," identified the leading organizational team Jakub Šaloun.
The entire festival is an open-ended concert of the middle school councils, which will be held on 17 November from 14 hours before the National Book of Technology in Davis.
On the program is the fund of an important Czech jazzman Karl Røžíčky Celebration Jazz Mass.

In the EU Vice-Presidents:
Czechs have a history of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously damaged the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little calm, and all players will be accustomed to their new role," she began her presentation at the Czech High School at the Milena Vicenová European Union.
As soon as its motto "Achievable and open about Europe" was taken seriously, it was already shown in the first part of the presentation when it was able to describe the individual EU bodies and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that it could find a number of submissions from the UK legal college.
Vice-President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye also welcomed the work of Vice-President Herman Van Rompuye:
"It was a criticism that it was not obvious that he was still an officer that he could not fulfill any role, and I have to say that he had all voiced that the role had been well-founded."
"He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicates excellently with them and has a clear vision where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question, "Who is this European Union? What phone number am I calling for?" as an important step towards joining and increasing the visibility of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from cigarettes.
Vicen has also been married to an agency that the European Council has lived and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency noted the success.
The Czechs have solved the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis, or organised a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The government's position at this time was then marked by a major negative, which seriously damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very full.
The term "framl fact" is said to have been not only the presidency but also the next financial crisis that is being solved today.
Moreover, a new seven-year budget of the Union must be accepted, which is very complex because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be calculated smooth and flexible, which the sector will have a priority, which will be supported more and less, it is all on the agenda of the next meetings.
She also recalled her main comments, which she came to Brussels, "O Europe understandable".
"I really don't like spicy shorts, strange words, a hat that no one understands.
How does the public understand that in Brussels there is no reason to think of closed or golden cherries, bananas of various sizes, or that we really have to ban cigarettes?".
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and to get more Czechs into the European institutions.
We're waiting for a multi-speed Europe
According to the report, Czechs have a history of Eurosceptics and people who are more concerned with these negative than positive sites.
It also hates the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
It says that there are many factors, such as the humility of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, the forces and cooperation of the Visegrad Four have increased.
"Believe me, when Poland and Hungary come after me and comes near Slovakia, then the French will say to me, "Hey, what are you doing there, what is your Visegrad Four?" And it doesn't matter."
In the future, according to Vice-Presidents, the Union is primarily looking forward to the new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As very real then they consider a two-speed concept, if not a multi-speed Europe, more than a new "European federation."
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We've got the Schengen area, we've already got an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"The first was said to cooperate only countries that want and those who don't want to stand back."
"These institutions will be more and will be a strong bilateral Europe," Vicenov expects.
In this regard, it also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the implementation of the principles on which all subjects affected throughout the Union are to be conducted between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Fire story:
IBM's Innovator begins its second century
If someone was looking for a word that the IBM's most recent strategy would probably be "long-termlessness".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, the company is considered to be very contemporary and, despite its establishment, has been running for hundreds of years.
On the basis of this long-term existence, the first head of the company, Vis. Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already explained that a number of world problems can be solved easily if people are willing to think.
His word "Think!" became such an impression that the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal journal that began to appear in IBM in 1935).
It was also based on Watson’s thorough building of firm culture.
"For us from IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for hundreds of years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was unable to change everything else.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century, we will be able to achieve even more," pointed to the year's co-author of the company Samuel J. Palmsano.
Professional system
In the three years, Watson joined in taking care of his employees like Băa business in Česku - the people of IBM had as one of the first American employees paid off, insurance from an employee plus an elegant employee uniform and a developed system for the awarding of best finders and dealers.
The same developed has a long-term IBM relationship with the customer.
Since the beginning, the company has been a genius in talent training - as one of the world's first companies has eliminated any discrimination, so she could choose.
In accordance with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, in the head of IBM, will set up a wife - Virginia Rometti next year.
This in the IBM has been moving for three years, and the position of sales, marketing and strategy leaders has remained.
In recent years IBM has made so-called amnesia, on-line brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations exist.
It's not surprising that there's plenty of ideas -- almost half a million people work in the company.
Institute with a good name
A strong position in the business ensures its strong internal and external images.
"From the beginning IBM had more institutional concepts than technology companies," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for technology use," added George Colony from Forrester Research's consulting company.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market equally.
IBM - or the "Great Blue" as it looks familiarly at her room in the United States - for a hundred years she grew into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most outstanding technology company - they develop hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in the school of products from servers by nanotechnology.
He holds most patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees have won Nobel Prize.
Its findings include banknotes, payment cards, financial swaps, black code or discs.
IBM's gross $220 billion this year became the second largest technology company in terms of market capitalisation (the first is Apple) when Microsoft first appeared in 1996.
Preview
Not all products and innovations have been tested in customer experience and time - IBM has not, for example, shown a box on its own OS/2 operating system, on-line Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computer.
"If your business is on the move ahead, you can't emotionally move to the past," says Samuel J. Palmsano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave it.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
In the IBM markets, the largest share of services is that of software and hardware.
At the same time, in 1990 he was more than half the most powerful hardware agent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold a small profit of $15 billion, while investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008 when the new financial crisis was first over the world.
IBM is one of his first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investments during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is currently facing an unaffected crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the share price of IBM has been around 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has grown continuously.
The IBM's firm password is to change everything, just not its values.
That's why it can be expected that even if there's another crisis, this flexible giant will control it.
IBM's History: From the Syrian emperor after the year to the universe
IBM (International Business Machines) was established in New York 100 years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tabulation Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted until 1924 - originally a sign used for branches in Canada and South America.
On the basis of the later IBM, he gave the Führer four films whose history dates back to the 18th century.
They own the technology as they need to say "fuck," so hours indicate the arrival and departure of employees.
The new company's architect was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over the company's board in 1930.
Flint hired the chief of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then replaced IBM's depositors - in Watson's ideas, a firm culture and identity have been established.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as her name suggests, started with the production and sale of all possible machinery for business - from the owners of meat and cheese after lunch.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, he doubled his business to nine million dollars and began expanding the company’s expansion to all the worlds.
Watson was so incredible for the company that almost four decades after she was shot by her son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its guidance IBM began working on the development of artistic intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, humans and computers from IBM helped NASA manage the seasons in the universe - in Mercur, Saturn and in 1969 the famous year of man on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pecker", which came up with the computer standard at that time, called IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Two years later, IBM sold the production of computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, instead bought a consultant part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers company and started to pay full attention to advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy that has been paid in the last three years by IBM is the concept of Smarter Planet, "the smartest planets".
Its aim is to make the use of technology in the long term neither of the planned areas nor of the improvement of the situation, for example in the right or the right city.
In the area of trade, the IBM platform "Smart Commerce" has recently been introduced, which helps traders to manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the dark.
Its territory was established in the former Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM ČR, the strategic outsourcing centre is also operating in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and is also a research team at the world level, with a voice recognition.
She complains about an unbelieving husband:
Iveto, leave it alone, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richter (53) said the end!
After her husband, Joseph Richtár (53) became not only the protector of Ivety Bartoshov (45), but also a millenix, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the red dream and return home.
Just waiting for an inconsistencies, and she set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"The Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained the Richter.
When Darina Ricchtárs gave an asylum to Bartoše in her home in summer, she apparently didn't see how her marriage ended.
Although Iveta was on her move for 30 days from Russia, Pepa didn't leave the song.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
With the passing of time, Darina refused, her husband’s attitude softened, and now she even gave him a lot of rest.
The hunter doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Richter and Bartosh were only once divorced, the house will not be open to his wife's arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will take him away."
"It does, however, come not as my beloved, blind old man, but as a man with whom I have a certain relationship," Ricchtar said with the fact that she has already retired from her husband and only continues to be in love with each other.
Joseph's being locked up by Darina's back door, it's okay.
"The decisions of the wife I respect."
"I'll be with Iveto and I won't change it."
"The wife has continued the paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The firm goes on, I care about repairs, the garden, the estate, I buy."
"Darino and I are having a whole normal time, even though we don't share a lie together," said Blesko Richter.
If the Richter also finds a new love, she won't be able to defend her.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Ivety and take all responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst female abuses: Are you affected?
When you ask men if they can name some typical female abuses, it's all right to one is very ready to get out of hand.
Dear women, do you know yourself in the following series, where are some of the women's crimes that can perfectly expose men to blood in the lungs?
Purchase
Does your second half tell you that you're dependent on buying?
Do you have to buy at least one wallet a week?
You buy love and together in the woods?
Then in your case, you can talk about buying as a crime.
Some women realize that they should have at least a little cut off their shopping cart.
But tell me, which would only allow you to walk through the clothes trades, look for yourself well-fashioned surfaces and then all of them (ideally in different colors) are tested in the cabin?
Even though it is for the majority of women buying horses, for men it can become quite a ready-looking trap.
Just remember how many times you told him to wait on you before he came in...
Unsatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five kilos - should I start dancing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don't you remember any of this news?
Yeah?
Then you belong to the women who belong to what they look like.
Not that you should stop worrying about yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners continue to complain about their views.
The stronger gender also agrees that the higher the frequency of this stress, the more women are more likely to be.
Order and cleaning at first place
It's like an endless cycle.
Immediate eyebrows, swelling, swelling of the throat, swelling of the nose, and it's at least twice a week.
You're counting on the partners to put a spinal cord on a clean bed, the kids to stop the broken furniture and to see the broken living wall with which you gave so much work?
If you're suffering from this "smooth," try to realize that there's nothing to overrun and order and purity should definitely not be within the family's first place.
This harmless touch of cleanliness can threaten your relationship and family balance.
Respiratory, thoracic, thoracic, connective tissue
"You used trainers go to the bone."
"You're gonna take your old shoes tomorrow too?"
"The strong arrow doesn't appear on the ground."
If you get to your partner this way several times a day, you know that you can beat him down.
Of course you don't think it's bad, you want to make it all right.
Maybe if the men knew that, the women wouldn't have had so much to drink...
Talk, hold
Some women also have their own conversations, drugs, but even harassment and association with someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and they are happy to do things like who, where, who, and why.
Almost every one of us is gonna drop out a little unharmed drudgery or a stick here.
Hands on the heart, it's almost all women.
On the other hand, they are the most common sound that they like and often hold, almost everyone is upset and they are for their environment - especially within the framework of a female working group - especially dangerous.
Jágr and Vorácek helped supporters to win Philadelphia
Hoke's opponent Jaromír Jágr participated in the NHL's semi-final launch by two supporters to the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on the ground of Carolina and is again at the head of the production of Czech players in competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added another play and was declared the best to play.
Two assistants were also registered by Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
The jury claimed that after the sea reporters had been shot, Giroux had predicted a big night.
"I told him before I made an agreement to give him a hittrick."
"I felt it."
"When you feel that way," explained Jágr, after his action Giroux gave the head of the first Flyers shooting.
A while later, he had a second shot at the Czech team.
The Vorček fought behind the Hurcanes box and presented it between the circles of Max Talbot.
The second before the first stop, he reduced to a weakened domestic player Patrick Dwyer, but the first part was again owned by Flyers.
Especially Giraux.
After working with Jagre, he shot a third head, after his shooting, he turned the race into the fourth Wayne Simmonds branch.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely among the best three," Jágr assessed his center.
"I would never think that at the end of my career I would play hockey like him."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play on it."
"All those years in NHL, my fellow players tried to play on me, now it's turning," added Jágr.
Carolina still made the drama by Tuoma Ruutua, and again Dwyer, who moved from the criminal shooting, got to a different branch.
But he didn't let Matt Read, who ended up counting two to one.
"He's perfectly in our Pronger song."
"He shot the cat, I picked up the speed, and (Read) went to the other side."
"I've tried to meet him and I'm glad it's gone," he wrote the last branch of the stock market from his view of Voráček.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
The Czech border of Montréal Jaroslav Špaček did not win a fight against Buffalo, and in the second third he withdrew due to injury in the upper part of the body.
Candiens, along with the tested beak, also lost double-bank leadership and lost after the criminal explosion 2:3.
One of their favorites didn't change Tomáš Pleakenec.
The home coach more than the lost points hated the wide bottom line of the rear row, where the game was held only on five rounds.
"It's bad."
"We've only played together with one experienced player, the rest of them were young."
"But there's nothing to do with it soon, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We couldn't afford it."
"We should have simplified the game more easily, we should've pulled a ball out of our dog."
In that we had mezers," added one of the defenders, Mr. K. Subban.
Czech banker Andrej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg matches to 5:2 on Tampou Bay.
About the yellow Jets that broke the five-pass series, five different shooters were divided.
How the prices of tickets have been developed since 1989
By 1989 there were only five national travel offices in Czechoslovakia: Čedek, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
In those days travel offices were sold in the majority of the country's socialist block, since travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists thus traveled to the sea to the NDR (Germany’s Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Swiss to the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, the Yugoslav regime reached the West and the Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently severely restricted.
The great paradox of socialism was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist block (e.g. also for the Czechs) to travel individually freely within the socialist countries.
If the citizens of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, they needed a letter from that country, otherwise there was no individual road.
Traveling offices at that time also offered access to the West, but it was necessary to set up a front across the night with a spare or "well known" in the travel office.
However, it wasn't won.
In addition, the dividend, which was a condition for travel in the West, was not made "politically independent people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a free exchange currency, without a dividend, so it was not possible to obtain financial means (the western currency) on the way to the West.
Far away, however, Chechnya carried a permit in the desert, resulting in a large number of chats and chalupas that made their way to Cheši, and this habit survives today.
Traveling the Czechs has been such a real revolution since 1989.
While by 1989 it was allowed in NDR or Bulharsk as our maximum, the fleet of Czechs spent 4.5 million abroad.
The vast paradox that we are not aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely by 1989, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
By the end of the 1990s, visa obligations had been reduced to neighboring Western European countries, starting with the vast wave of short-term visits, especially in France or Germany.
The Czechs couldn't get a long trip to the West, everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czechs slept in the parking lot, since our current income did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
The typical course of the Czech journey was at this time driving your own food, condoms, salamis, etc. to heal.
Another important moment was the introduction of a free-changed Czech crown, which our tourists could finally buy for the western mine after many decades.
However, our standard of living and the average wages fell, which was released by 1997 at another important moment.
As a result of increased demand for travel, travel offices began regularly since 1997 to prepare flights with charter flights, with the opportunity to speak of multiple discounts in comparison with the past unliquidated.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs had already had virtually no contact with all the developed countries, except the United States, which further facilitated our journey.
Another interesting moment in the history of the revolutionary journey took place in the year 2000, when thanks to a significant demand from the Czech Republic, the first direct charter year to the exotic was due to Thailand.
From this year onwards, the Czech tourists fly directly to warm countries every year, the annual winter will fly directly from ČR to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic country is currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs every year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa for Czech tourists was canceled and our country was definitely included among the most prosperous countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their foreign permits (50.3%) in the past and lost one foreign permit, including the cost of living on the site more than 15 thousand people.
Valiant group has to find the president, but it's dangerous again.
For about five months, the Czech football is no president and it threatens that Ivan Haška's presence in the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary football club, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburc.
There is still no agreement, according to which voluntary order will be made.
Without it, she will not even vote on the one that will be elected from the three candidates.
I'm interested in bringing the Czech football to Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek refused to work in June, and when he left, he called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that would lead the football to the future.
Only in the summer after Haskko's photobal moved back to the travels between the two wedding rooms that could not agree with the joint candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when the new President was to be elected.
The delegates to the National House at Prague in Míochova were sitting in a row, since the meeting remained blocked and not only on the way of the election.
It did not even agree who has the right to vote in the assembly itself - whether only statutory representatives or full-power employees.
In this single paragraph since then, a partial agreement has been reached which has also helped to recommend the State and law Statute, which provides that full power is not possible.
But the spores are still running on a voluntary order.
You have made it clear that neither the Executive Committee has entered the situation, nor has the Executive Committee, which is no longer in its proceedings, whether it is fair or extraordinary, essentially nothing else.
The view of the option of choice has changed several times, but the neural point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed to car 3 to get rid of the possibility of a pasta?
"The sport is in whether to act in accordance with the circumstances or to find another model," said one of the three presidents of the FAČR Dušan Freedom, who represents a professional football in the management of the association.
According to the estimates of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have a higher percentage of support in the chamber will win over the candidate.
We must be willing to go to the agreement to win a candidate who will get a higher percentage of votes from both rooms.
And the Czech side extends the condition that the winner has to gain at least two-thirds of the transfer in this percentage calculation.
"Because it would then leave the meaning of two previous cars, it would completely violate the two-way concept," explains the concept of the freedom of the Moorish side, which would be the best way to stop and vote according to the tax conditions.
In some cases, it also agrees with Tomáš Paclík, although it is assumed that the conditions set by the electoral order depend on all candidates most of Pelt.
"I swear to love him as much as I can."
"In order not to think of any of the strange meanings as in the past wave assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who is the first to apply and in his statement he was particularly opposed to Pelt.
The ball stays optimistic.
In Nymburc, he said, the new president will know and believe that the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All yours is a very comfortable case today's procedure for the national team on the mission of Europe."
"The football will again be on a happy occasion, it will be more willing to work together," said an apple maker, who has from all three of the greatest experience with football management both at the professional and regional level.
Rachel's more stable.
"I trust the agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very complicated."
"It's not between the people of Czech and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the rules to them."
"This can cause the blockade of the wave group to come again."
"I hope, however, that it gives a healthy mind," said Rachel.
There's not much time left for the agreement on all sides.
Some meetings were to be played directly in the Black Mountains, which is who would think the football general would be entirely complete in the afternoon.
The airport special in which they were to travel to Podgorica except for the presidents of Dalibor Kuchera and Rajchl, who did not fly from Prague due to technical disturbances in the morning and sought a replacement option, as part of the executive committee, to deliver the actual loading instructions.
Finally, it may be possible to hold an open meeting at ministerial level, which may reach an informed medium.
Minister of School, Youth and Body Joseph Dobeš would like to accept the split sides within the strongest sports association in the country to the agreement.
In the game, this is a lot: the state supply, the reliability of the football and also the ČSTV wave collection, which will solve new direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazky.
The package goes to the front, because it doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the head of the football team had seen Tomáš Paclík before the extraordinary wave of events, he would have met all of his views on the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor would he have reported to the war on the highest function.
"If there's a quality adapter, I'm fighting for him and I'm not going to the poll."
"But for the current situation no such person has been able to find," said ČTK Paclík.
In his love with Miroslav Pelto and Jindrich Rajchlem's wife Paclík's motivations to just try to get Pelt, a particular favorite choice, into the road to the head of the FAČR.
The Paklik also points out that in the event of its victory, the President would only remain until 2013 when the programme is in the proper position.
In the function, he would like to see an experienced and spy manager who is not too comfortable with the football game.
"I spoke to some people who would take note."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with the Czech photo. "
"I'd like to change such a view," he said.
Paclikov is now the first of the most powerful Palt's association with the President of the Plzeń National Football League, Roman Berbrem, a man with a controversial history known in the castle as a strong lobbyist, whose ability to influence the vote of delegates at the wave club.
For Paclíka, it's so unfriendly that Pelta becomes the president.
"If he wins, then he's saving his current position and nothing in the fotoball would come forward."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, which is a reasonable businessman, it would not benefit the football anymore," Paclík said.
It also argues that Pelt's name has been registered in late-years in the investigation of corrupt affés, from which Pelt's absence of punishment.
"I don't know what a pretzel would have brought Pelt's victory. "
"And as we would also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who but now also takes a look at his some kind of product that would "selling a swimming club if Pelta became president."
If Paclík would triumph in the fourth election, he would be able to represent future cooperation with Pelto.
He also considers another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclík supported before the closing wave of the storm that ended the storm.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I'd go with."
"My great abilities."
"I'd be able to imagine him as the head of the representative."
"But the manager could not manage the association."
"I also don't have a nose where I can't do it," Paclík, who in turn raised a great interest in calling the decision-making commission on behalf of Man Macle, who rewarded Dagmar Damk.
Paklik says he's going to take the lead in the association.
It appeals to its ability to manage private companies, also in the past year's Chief Plzni, who, with his support in May, has celebrated the Prime Minister's league triumph.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to his particular culture."
"To limit the influence of certain stakeholders, which should have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and calling commissions, which is leading to adverse situations," Paclík said, who do not take their antipathies, for example, to Daniel Kretinsk's partner chief.
For one of the priorities, he would also consider the implementation of the FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympics Committee, with which he would like to have the help of political spies to earn more money from lottery taxes in sport.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should be hired."
"When it comes to gambling, as political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but at least they have to say where money goes," he pointed out.
As a competition now, Paclík doesn't even take his relationship with the Plenary Club to claim himself that the President of the FAČR should be "extremely".
Plenta is again connected to Jablonce, Rachel with the Prussian Duke.
"It's not perfect."
"I can't see it, but I don't even think I'm going to pass my shares on to someone in the swimming club and in a year and a half he's back there," Paclík said.
Plenta promised new FAČR residences that would release the volunteer boat
Two days before the elections, one of the candidates to President Miroslav Pelta agreed that, in the case of a election, the FAČR would have new positions that would definitely trigger disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonek official is a fourth meeting in Nymburce optimistic and believes that the pre-war is clearly encouraging the success of today's football representation.
In the absence of an inconceivable vote, Pelta promised that the right to represent and obtain financial resources would be taken into consideration in the event of a decision to concentrate.
He decided to go to the polls before the last wave, and so his two-month deduction could take place in order to cover and present his presentation of the photovoltaic management.
"People at all levels have taken a long time to take a photo and expect the President to know on Thursday."
"He feels that it's the highest time for an association to take over," said a man who is primarily associated with the apple club, but who spent several years in the Sparta and the executive committee.
And that's why he thinks he's got enough experience so he can run a Czech football.
It is confirmed that today's problems with freedom are the euphoria that prevailed during the rule of Ivan Haška.
"However, on the Red Wall, the positions were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If different explanations were not allowed, we had been in the chair since September," Pelta warned.
The proper processing of the most important document of the civil society has been considered a delegation.
"If I'm the president, I'll take it as my personal assignment and I'm willing to assume my personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"It's a basic thing we can't be," says Pelta.
He's just trying to keep up with his opponents.
He had already announced that he would be able to present his cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, who recognizes him for his legal education, and he well knows that his pro-indication would be his first vice president.
He didn't even meet Thomas Paclík, who, unlike Pelt's, left the night dry.
"There's something moving in the fotoball over the year, he's already got some success."
"But his attacks were in vain, and many people jumped in the way of a voluntary campaign."
"And therefore a number of them now doubt his real character," said Pelta to the opponent's address, who just remains faithful to the proclamation that he has already announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitors to the most representative.
That should be an explanation of the photovoltaic.
"And I would also try to end all the apheres begins with the cause of Bohemians or the calls of a late corruption scandal."
"Now I would return to meeting with the private and state sector to ensure that we have enough money for the entire football," the CTC said a six-hundred-year candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his coming to the head of the football would mean no personal cleaning.
"I should first meet with full-time individual employees," he pointed out to Strahov, where a long-term lack of government is driving an understandable nervous system.
Despite the more recent catastrophic scenarios that are being held by a huge crowd, they believe that on Thursday they will not go to Nymbruk too.
"If it's the only fight I'm going to be in the third wheel, we'll be able to move through it."
"The football needs credibility, and it's only here that it will finally have its leader again," Pelta remains two days before the possible day of her career of optimism.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the new President of the Association of the Czech Republic were to be elected by President Jindrich Rajchl on Thursday morning, many of the people in the association would not be pleased.
Rachel also promises that she will work hard in the event of her choice.
He wishes to make systematic changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each photoball area.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to the football club and continue to work with former President Ivan Hasek.
"As the president, I would like to hire a football player as a total."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representations, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'd do everything myself," Rachel said in a talk for the CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to share competence in the Executive Committee so that each of the members has a certain area."
"And I'm going to give you a hard task to take a picture of a love step forward in every segment of this segment."
"Many people would probably not be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticise the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football field, he first considered that he would no longer apply.
"I know I'm doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won't have people behind me who will continue to shake my legs and cause every step of my step," he explained why he was crying.
"Many people told me I shouldn't give it up, because they'd give it to others."
"It's a trust I can't just guess," he said.
It motivates him to get on with the work he started with Haskek.
"For the two years he's been doing a great job, and I don't want to miss it now."
"There are initiated processes that will have a call for up to a few years, and I would not like someone to stop it," he complained with fears that in the case of the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelty, the whole situation could go back to the time before Haskek.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something that I think Mirek Pelta can't do."
"There are, above all, bound-up people who would make a photoball so that it would be only for those."
"I can count on a lot of things, but I'm certainly not a stranger."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a photoball for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just you," noted Rachel.
Repugnant and claiming he would only be the Czech president.
"Even if some people try to claim it again, I'm planning to do it for Morawa's maximum."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would split into the Czech and the Lebanese part of which the winners would go to the first league."
"It wouldn't have been the same situation when there are only three marine cells in the lake, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
Since the president also joined the president's club chief Tomáš Paclík, Rajchl is unable to give up his choice.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice president and sees that there are clear successes in me," said Rachel, who, for her success, views the healing of ten million crowns on unexplained contracts, the conclusion of television contracts and the conclusion of lottery law.
On the contrary, he's giving himself up for the conversation that the competition doesn't go away for a one-way ride.
While it states about Pelt, he is "dequately qualified to return to the Czech football club", another of the opponents of Paclíka is considered to be a strong candidate who has the football to offer.
"No one can doubt that Plzna took a great job this year."
"If he had been elected, he might have continued in the things that Ivan Haszek started here and would not have changed the staffing in the commissions in any way."
"He wouldn't want to steal it in his advantage," the values of Rachel's rivals.
The most beautiful European pools
Look at the blue
Julia Stanek
Broisella from Ufona's view, a swimming pool in Budapest: Anyone who travels Europe can live his blue vision - and after watching the city or travelling let his tired legs rest in the thermal lasers.
The book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder was released in a late one and a half years on the public road, she should not have been missing in her background: her lungs.
The bed on the water, looking at the heights of the art of made copper, sailed against the marble pupti (I'm setting up a small foot boy, a child (with wings)) waiting on it at the bottom of the pool and enjoying a fully restored secessary floor.
If she was liked by some sailors, she brought her to her writer - and with remarkable details about how the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 fleets have studied this way of historical architecture Meder and now represent it in its right-hand book "Badefreuden (Radosut from shopping) ": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace in Schwarzwald, "The second core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her to "Cesta for the most popular leisure in Central Europe": According to Germany, Rakouska and Switzerland, she visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a true Enthusiastian Feveren culture.
With sports it's a lot of fun, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
The only thing to do is to calm the falsifiers with the blue whales and the chlorine cap, while those who run for health can breathe the smell of cold forests or listen to the happy lighting of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the flower must always be so sweet," said Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started gathering beautiful flowers."
Water level doubles architecture
The explosion in the Scottish pool and the erectile oil for the sauna - the factor of the occasion is so great that it concerns all the meanings, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the depositors try, they can be a real bird for the eyes: "The place of the floor is a man in a lake of water."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All optically doubles: high cloning, pears, scotch finger.
The Maloformal Photography "Badefreuden (Currade of Buying)" offers 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural events of the historical wellness - it stimulates, in particular, the desire to jump into the blue.
An outstanding example was revealed by a sailor, Mrs. Meder, on his flight to Hungary.
According to the beautiful medical labs such as 100-year-old Szecheny in Budapest, she found water with showers in the original spa in Miskolc-Tapolca and thermal lakes filled with alcalic water and located in the building form of oil (Várasi Termáfürdö in Jasberén).
On the other hand, many well-dressed flolars offer a wide range of skyscrapers in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has from the Curiosian shopping mall all over the city, he can look at the snowy outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton in the Arlberg snow - and: In the parlours there is a window from which he can watch the flow on the ski resort.
The most outstanding design of the pool is expected to be located in Längenfeld: Akvapark Ötztal looks like an ufo that just arrived in Alpach.
From the three tops of open clouds in the winter, the couple stand while in the background of the mountains of Ötztalu makes it to heaven.
Alhambra and Schwarzwaldu
Not in every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder's pool picker, he's got a chlorine in his chest.
Many thermal spas are to feel after the sire, in the Larpáds in Hungarian Bequescsa, it's a smell of burning oil to the point that a man almost believes he's got into the healing spas.
The strain comes from medicinal water containing alkaline hydrogen sulphite, which is almost black and its insulating into the skin when only a person enters the pool - some special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also one of the places where she was looking for a beautiful lassament: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and air-conditioning lasna Luhačovice, she found herself on a closed ground.
In 1902 the architect Dusan Jurkovice was put in the middle of the project.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the falling windows of the red-white-green-yellow building, she saw how it could expand the flow between the stairs.
The scene was set against this in the famous flower shop in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
They have three phases of the exhibition; the man can reveal not only the novoroman primates that come from the time of his appearance in 1844, but also the maursca lake in the style of Alhambra, which was attached in about 1900.
Since the summer of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite Lazönsk place of the pools of Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"Now it's a success, to connect so wide a building wall into such a beautiful complex," said Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, the heating in the thermal pool is obviously an acute concern.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the trade with comedians
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving his business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information, Joseph Ackermann trusted the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
Then in January, the head of the group wants to produce results.
Hamburg-
For the public, it is clear that 84% of the Germans claim that it is unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the questioned even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to emerge from this trade because the world's poorest problems are growing.
This is the result of Forsa's survey of consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study will describe the report that Foowdatch presented in half of October.
In it, author Harald Schumann points out that the sales in global comic book prices are high and banks are therefore not compatible with the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at the chief of Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similar.
Initially, camedish chains were designed to ensure that traders were against price trends.
In contrast, most experts agree that the participants in the capital market are interested in high-risk trades in response to tenders and requests and that they have achieved the most recent gains.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann’s criticism: He promised that he would check the results and said that no trade "is needed to be a good message from Deutsche Bank in cash".
According to information, SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the International Working Group on Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the controls must be closed, and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Presidency - together with the recommendations to be put in place.
At the end of the summer, bank representatives want to report the consequences.
Finally, trade reductions with comedians or even total rejections could be avoided.
Ackermann works by himself on his image.
The Head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time, he stressed his criticism of the financial sector: "The meeting on growing food prices shows particularly drastic how banks today, regardless of whether they do, damage the general budget."
Ackermann as the highest bank lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all the items in which the money is used for food exchanges," Bode said.
"Laughingly, is Mr. Ackermann about the cold of people's suffering or about the Deutsche Bank story?"
Ackermann's view is first viewed as surprising, but it is clear that the head of the group would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before leaving the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the presidency would not go to the Board of Auditors unless it was planned.
By turning away from a competitive gambling speculation, he could improve his image.
And you don't have to worry about the possible loss, so you should consider the end of his story.
Any other investment in raw materials would have declared
Foodwatch is trying to keep a high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Institute of Forsa asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is estimated that, according to this, it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to food prices.
Many customers of the bank would also have personal consequences if they knew that their bank was involved in such trades: Each other would, as a result of the investigation, have informed all the investments in which the money came from speculating with raw materials.
43 per cent would be warned before such a bank, 49 per cent indicated that they would think about paying their account and going to another institution.
Home of the 21st century in Vienna
Moveed Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with tops, fall and happy endem: The Rakousian Pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 gained prices, became in the Vidne Museum, remained empty and released.
Now they're reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is heated for modern holiday architecture, for clear forms, painted halls, courageous mixes and new building materials that are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Raquel Pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer's Pavilon then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its ease and highly moving steel and glass construction.
The state is dedicated to the milling of contemporary architecture.
He praised the architect so much that he also built the Pavilon Rakouska for the next world exhibition.
At the end of 1973, with his legendary four-star BMW palace plus as the key to the next building in Munich, he celebrated internationally.
As a temporary exhibition building designed by the world after the exhibition, it was located in Schweizer Garten in the Videna Südbahnhof (The South Sea), rebuilt and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - was called the "House of the 20th Century".
But it was not appropriate for the museum to be built, either in space or in technology, to miss walls to engulf artistic exhibits, no exciting climate.
However, it was used until modern art was expected in Vienna of a new stage.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and captured more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the Pavilon, now called "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
In the evening, the Museum of Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, is the first exhibition - a happy goal in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Rakuus Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted historical art with a significant career, i.e. in young Krassobruslar, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum, and as the founder of modern Museum Salzburg, has successfully rebuilt policies and monuments, has provided public funds and private sponsors and has determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the work of sugar Fritze Wotruby should be the same offer, coffee and bookshops should be set up, and office buildings should be set up.
Right view, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was an ideal host.
Not only did he emotionally rebuild and expand the sequencing building of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but in Schwanzer he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilon was "a very important place" for him, where he looked at exhibitions almost every week.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building that had already been lost in his move to Vienna and the change in use.
At the present reconstruction, there were far more problems: Budova was a "captapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The profile of the windows of the façade was replaced by the glass-shafted insulation glass and the glass-coated glass was replaced by a special safety layer.
The cold-eye bearings were either strengthened or replaced, and the asbetted roofs were sanded.
Two underground stations provided a space for new use, abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street, there is a lighting that leads to the entrance of the museum - almost a new building, but still a proud Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door remained maintained, the building was built in an old red-coloured red tonne.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And that's all for the exact consideration of the memory office and the low budget.
"There has to be often found material that is good and cheap and also loved the memory authority," says Krischanitz, pointing to the split floor of the suteeren.
Over all the pressures, problems and reconstruction remain flexible and air-conditioning.
It was difficult before it was with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels," said Krischanitz, typical "Drop-in-the-City-historie".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "build proper knowledge".
In this case, however, the 21st century is not an unsatisfied place, because the urban success has come to an end: in the vicinity around Schweizer Garten, a whole new "City Square in the Central Sea" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps another happy occasion will come: By the 21st century, he could have received support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporère Kunsthalle and how he heard, he was already with a neighboring town in the Swiss Garten.
Draha plans a package for the winter crisis at a million-dollar level
Draha has developed a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in the winter period.
The number of employees should be double.
It'll be a million.
In the fight against climate-related train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues over EUR 70 million this year, according to news reports.
The "Bild" news came forward in advance with a call for an internal consolidated plan to calculate the total investment of around EUR 300 million by 2015.
It should be helped to make better use of trains and rail networks, as well as under extreme weather conditions.
A total of 16,000 persons are planning to double the number of internal and external employees to remove snow on railway devices and stations.
The aim should be to free the station to start the operation and 90 per cent for the necessary departures during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, chief of Dr. Rüdiger Grube, after meeting at the highest level, represented the government and industry before train accidents and delays during the summer.
In the past winter she had serious problems in her personal affairs, because she had insufficient reserves, except for the difficult weather conditions.
Thus, a number of new regional trains are expected to be approved by the Joint Railway Authority for years.
In addition, delay is allowed for ICE train repair
The driver has also not been able to allow ICE trains to be controlled more frequently after one ICE train has arrived at Köln's main port for the destruction of the equipment.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of bills in the United States
After the divorce by Chief Joseph Ackermannna comes to a new trampot in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of fines.
As the problems of the house were not enough for Deutsche Bank, she got a job in the defense of her past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in one balance sheet of $145 million (106 million) in order to settle disputes over the Bank's five large social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage letters.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator calculates a number of large banks that the bonds of the Societies Banks have failed to buy financial products; the risk is likely to be reduced.
Such papers have been lost during the crisis significantly on the value of the bank with them.
"We are pleased that we could solve the subject without the need to bring the parties to the court," said the Deutsche Bank speaker in New York.
The bank does not recognise any fault by comparing it.
It also pays for the Citigroup, which was committed to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz has highlighted the accuracy of both financial institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for social banks in the United States and assists banks in protecting customer requests.
NCUA is trying to get a reward for causing billions of damage.
Now finished equations are their first kind.
The regulator also appealed to other banks, and in summer he complained about JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the suspicious hypothetical lists, it's called Mortgage-backed Security.
They're based on bank loans.
When the U.S. bublin came to an end in 2007, a number of financial companies were convicted.
In September 2008, the US-Investment Bank Lehman Brothers changed their views on the high financial crisis.
Even though it happened a few years ago, it's now falling to the banks in a storm of fierce wind.
Investors and survey authorities have filed numerous complaints to make adjustments or make mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) filed the largest complaint.
There are 18 international banks that two U.S. bankers living in the property of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage trades amounting to about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA complaint, which includes a total of approximately $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Authority requests that the French Constitution respond to "substantial losses " without adding any direct amount to it.
Deutsche Bank rejected claims as irrevocable and declared he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion to IBM
Buffett's financial guru invests effectively to the IBM's IT subnet.
From March, he bought an asset worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, major American investor Warren Buffett has always announced that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term company development is only going to face difficulties.
However, he has now read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
In the past, IBM had to understand that it provides services above all and identifies computer systems for the IT division of other businesses.
The Warren Buffetta Investment is committed in the financial world to match the interest rate.
As a result, it can be called the IT IBM's mother-in-law now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has issued a bid at the U.S. C.C.B.C.C.C.C.C.A.A.A.A.A.A.$ 10.7 billion from March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said he didn't even know anything about his engagement.
He thanked the management that he was trying to make the economic crisis even for the good results.
"You did a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been operating for a long time on a lucrative IT service such as the operation of accounting centres.
More than 100-year-old computers also offer software and advice and efficient computers for companies.
Buffett's tech company has been running more and more out of it today.
He claims that he only invests in businesses whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett sold it on a cost-effective railway, on a mazive or on a production machine.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 of his own daughter's company also participated in a number of large companies such as the Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Munich Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old lord took over a small textile company in Berkshire Hathaway and built with it one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Still his way of life is modest.
That's why for many investors around the world, it's a cultural institution.
His almost improper sense of money-making brought him a vision of "Omaha's Orakel (Zazarak's Omaha".
When Buffet's investment became known, IBM's share rose by one percentage before the start of the storm.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a total price of more than 220 billion dollars on the bridge and is awarded along with Apple and Microsoft for the world's most valuable technology companies.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to move.
Founder Bill Gates is his only trusted friend.
The threat is imaginative
Following the announcement of "Bunks in Zwicka" Turkish media suspects the German legal state.
News is even talking about the "blood ideology" that now lives again.
There were always eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek in the years 2000 to 2006 who had a legitimate extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkey population in Germany, this report has been answered with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German Turks, the horror that has been caused long after the deaths is gone: From the summer attacks in Möln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there was no comparable violence with a legitimate extremistic background.
That there was a xenophobic in Germany, however, there was never a mistake.
However, the apparent legitimate extremism network reflects the size of which it has been unable to see for a long time.
"Is it living blood ideology again?" said the headlines of the online release of the Turkish news "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the news of Sabah points out that one of the parties should be a secret police agent for the protection of the Constitution and fear that the German authorities could also be involved in the right radical church.
Turkey's citizens of Germany responded with a clear response: she recalled the weekend of demonstrations of torture against the Brandeburg branch of the victim of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, Turkey's village in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, was reminded of the German-Turkey Convention on the Collection.
In happy colors, a common life was staged as a result of success.
As a policy here, a number of Turkish media reports: "Darek Germany to the West" is a post of an article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also publishing a list "Hürrijet" for Germany can't take it to avoid this mental connection.
"It's starting to wrap it up," says the title of the column from Ahmet Kulachi.
It highlights the fact that the people who paid taxes and their work had been killed had made an important contribution to the return of Germany.
The most critical is discussed in the German online forums of police procedures and her late success in monitoring.
Why didn't the German authorities come up with a lot of time before, so that after suspected patrols in the right extremistic circles, the authors were surprised.
Thus, many are at least retortically prepared for the use of drastic means: "If the work continues to be done here on such a level, it will not give passengers anything but their own defence and weapons."
"It'll be probably the best self-defense."
"To the quality of clarity and accuracy of the entire network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means, if internal peace in Germany is threatened, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen have been explained in the 1990s.
The photo of the bedroom in Solingen is a deep door to the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because there was no other incident here that made it clear to the Turks living here that there was a tremendous threat and to the Germans that they could not believe and turn their backs on the right violence.
However, the attacks have made Turkey’s side more transparent.
Don't repeat errors in the past
In the Turkish press, there was the first criticised mention of German policies after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Möln who had survived.
After a summer attack in Solingen, he sent a generous telegram to the Turkish state president, but he left his foreign minister Klaus Kinkelem - Kinkel to be represented in his release, counting the payments made by Turkey earlier.
Just as the value of a person is measured according to the height of his tax.
The current report of the Turkish media again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks is in the wider state order.
According to the notion of a comprehensive explanation and a new assessment of the right to extreme terrorism in Germany, this requires open words.
Scandal bank in the Curys Lake
The best European bank has no seat in Italy or France, of course in Switzerland.
The U.S. has been suffering from a financial crisis almost Bankruptcy and has been from one crisis to another since then.
Now it's got some German to compare.
That's why Axel Weber didn't mean it.
After his partial departure from the head office of the Company Bank, it became known in June that it will take place in 2013 at almost the same spectacular new employment: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank U.S. - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber was happy publicly, hailed Switzerland for his beauty and the U.S. for her newfound solidarity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The U.S. file worked."
"I'm happy to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was already clear in September that everything was going to happen completely differently.
One U.S. dealer in London destroyed all the banking security systems and lost about EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the U.S. President Oswald Grübel, not only a known banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the U.S. Board of Directors has been also under attack since then - and all are asked: When will Axel Weber finally come?
I already know that Weber bank has been working since February 2012.
And the President of the Governing Council will take over in May, not first in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
For Axela Weber, it'll be hard.
He's not a banker, he's a more economic professor, and he's an emission banker, and he's definitely gonna need a working time.
Then we will assume responsibility for the banking strategy, which has just proved once again that it deserves the title "The Bank of Europe's biggest scandals"
Because the U.S. is huge, however, until recently she was the biggest manager of the property in the world, and she's been shut down for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, won't be left behind by the Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, U.S.A. had enjoyed excellent history.
The image of the gentle and solid but also the detailed owner of the estate is combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to make something significant in investment banking.
Thus, in 2007, the U.S. had spent $1.6 billion on one side more money on potential customers than on any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she acted as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That's what I did.
An ex-banker and a long-term banking professor at Curychu Hans Geiger reports: "I always introduced the U.S. as a model of good banks to my students."
"From today's point of view, the man asks, "How could I be so wrong?"
He made a big mistake.
In 2007, it was first evident that something in the U.S. had happened well.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who has been awarded a position of great intelligence and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, he was showered for leaving.
The Bank's investment division has broken the Subprime-papers and has to cancel billions.
In order to stand up, U.S. has announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
That is why she found investors, even those who had recently kept her nose: an invisible Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab state fund, which was so discrepancy that a person did not even know his name.
But it was just the first time.
In April 2008, it developed mountains.
The Bank had to admit new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, another best paid Board of Directors of Switzerland, left.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: the U.S. continued to take account of its misinvestment in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank purchased from the U.S. for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to a legally variable bond that could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was devastated - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet was more than five times higher than the effect of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We could not save the U.S. once again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is another.
A few months ago, the U.S. capitalized in the tax dispute with America and expressed the desire to issue the data of potential customers who, if possible, cut the tax.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on the wrong profit from these trades, including interest rates.
The U.S. was found to be more or less open to help the tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that she's been renegotiating to her capital in competition for a rich client: a swatozer of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
The Head of the Presidency and the President of the Governing Council followed up.
And exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central trading areas for several months: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the management of property to help finance tax cuts.
And just when it got a little calm again, just when it thought that the U.S. was going back, there comes this unfortunate business analysis: the only dealer lost EUR 1.7 billion before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And that's clear: with the risk management in investment banking, it's obviously still not enough.
"In the case of Aboboli, it is likely that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich Banks.
The financial director of the large German banks is also sure: "The U.S. problem is that it does not control the risk."
At the same time, it was exactly the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long gone to become followers of the world's great estates: there was no too much risk, so the security for money - also from this side, the Alpine Republic was once again ruining the world.
The Swiss banks' treasures became a symbol of the inconsistencies such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly quality chocolate.
The U.S. Center in Curychu is still going to a cool Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
It's a classic place.
The bank has its main seat in the Curiosian Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Kuryšsk Lake, which is covered by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss Mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, business rentals belong to the highest in Europe.
The clandestines like Tiffany's are here between Swiss traditional shops like the Srüngli sugar.
The Swiss bank has already been sitting here for centuries: from the National Bank via the Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
In the reception hall, the U.S. shall enter into the difficult back door.
Inside are the walls covered with marble, with possible leather cross, next to the bank's logo a big guide to "seyfu".
The U.S. knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea is the Swiss banks of both Swiss banks, U.S.A. and Credit Suisse, however, have sometimes been attacked or betrayed, as the head of one Swiss private bank finds out.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, he would eventually end up as all the Swiss bankers, as well as with both big banks of trade.
The U.S. has probably increased too much, finding out, especially in the investment banking industry, where the Anglo-Saxes expanded further.
The priests probably don't have anything to say about it.
"And, if so, they've adapted to a long English way."
In fact, it was an English investment firm that changed the U.S., which initially led to high profits and then a group: No European financial institution has lost so much money as Switzerland's Grand Bank in the jungle.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was apparent.
"In that middle, the government coalition of the small seven-milioned country was founded on the greatest rescue action in the history of its people," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der U.S.-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about EUR 45 billion have been approved by politicians in order to save a bank standing in front of the bank.
How could she do that?
If he speaks to Swiss bankers, he sees the problem primarily in the size of the U.S.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks joined the potential group.
A bank that was already too big for small Switzerland - and still grew.
It also helped to complement the two different banking precedents of the U.S.: One rich, but the bank in Kurychu with a weight in the management of property and poverty, but more internationally involved.
The internationalisation of investment banks came well to a large amount of money that could break up a large roll.
Two names are attached to this UU statement: Peter Wuffli, head of the UU Group and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of futures," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Uffly, the highly intelligent, humble person who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who manages to feel around the complaint that he has developed from banking science all over the top."
But Ospel was finally joining Wuffley.
And Wuffli probably made up his mind to solve his mistakes: "If he thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The pass was past.
The U.S. employees clearly mention the myth of the leading workers on whom the Chief of the Wuffli Group has repeatedly repeated the same word: Get Goldman Sachs from the bottom line.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
He introduced "League Tables", a director who documented the success of the bank at that time.
In it, the U.S. was trying to put the whole thing up there.
A few steps have already happened to her.
In trade with the dividends and shares, the games were all up.
However, senior advisers who have been trusted highlight one weakness: In the international market, in the word "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
The U.S. has mezers in American hypothetical products.
In order to close this measure, the U.S. has agreed to the favor that it has almost remained.
Cold after growth, both the bank and its own funds were invested to ensure the risk of American investment in Subprie.
She developed into a potential machine that was valued by the U.S. hypothetical credit and then transferred it - but also left the risk alone.
Even when the other banks were looking for the east.
"Even in 2007, when the real estate market was in the fields, the U.S. bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, so deep.
One manager had to leave after another when the attempts to calm down were harder than she thought.
The positions in the U.S. have become catapulting seven and are expected to date.
Whoever runs the bank now, he's got almost uncontrollable work.
He has to find strategies for the bank that have lost all nearby business models.
Banker Geiger already has the idea: End with investment banking, ownership management concentration, return to Switzerland's roots.
The bank of the network ( Still) doesn't want to go that far.
But investment banking has got to be very much lost, so it's clear now.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was understood to be only as a transitional solution when the bank miraculously broke up with the president of Grübel.
In the meantime, he had a long history of U.S. trade, sent the Korean bank in the evening.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to its status in the mid-1990s.
3500 places of slaughter.
But that won't be enough.
The U.S. needs a visa.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking himself now.
But he's already saying he's just gonna find his wife in Curych first.
Next year.

It found investors in the US skeptical. "We don't have any islands, they're probably dependent," said Steve Goldman from Goldman's management.
Europe is probably not so quick to withdraw from the recession, but there are other signs of the bank's weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this view: In one CNBC interview, he said it would probably not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That's why it's probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a few decades of old principle and entered the U.S. technology industry.

Intelligent walls expand in cities
In many places the havrann are full of "problem birds": However, this highly intelligent animal has long been unable to express, claims experts.
One is happy, the other likes to get rid of them as soon as possible: The walls belong to the city's image, although in some villages the population is gathered to a lack of cleanliness and the root of the animals caused.
At the same time, there's no way against the "problem birds" of some means.
Havrann's full probably can't be released from the city anymore, the experts reported on the first symposium on the wares in eastern Leer.
There, experts from the entire community consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Naturalists also brought problems from the city's exodus, particularly protected guinea pigs: the use of chemicals in agriculture is likely to reduce the traditional area of life in growing terms.
Tracking, growing construction and cutting of typical trees for bird landing are life-threatening.

Large colonies with more than 600 railway pairs are outside the Westphal Soesta, in the north-west, outside of Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Brem and Leer.

The removal of the snow from the water or the fall of forests has often adverse consequences, said expert on the environment of Manfred Kaiser from Lahru in Badensk-Württemberg.
"The animals rise, the great colony jumps and divides into other places."
Fear is only thought of as an exception to the hospital, the home of the parents or school.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the city cannot solve the problem, was the view of the old Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is thought that the combination of animal excavation from sensitive habitats and their introductions is to be found elsewhere.
"The information table instead of the retspapers" promoted the psychology and ethnologies of Uta Maria Jürgens because of all the behavior of animals: "We can finally stop a victim in the face with our own conscience."
Ms. Jürgens worked in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's academic background, which provides the information table on the life of an intelligent hero full of life.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Also, on the criticism of the bird’s prey, Mrs. Jürgens had his own opinion: "This is about every range of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and fertility of the animals are legendary: the havrani filles do not use only the help to get the memory, even as the help of their tool is made.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the behavior of four sharks full of birds as far as they achieve the intelligence of birds.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that stones had to bring construction cuts so they could get to the laurels.
Without a big coach, they knew what size and shape they had to have to have a rock to cause the ball of the plane.

A powerful new book called The Beauty and the Sorrow: Faithful History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of outstanding events that will affect your head.
One advice as to how to behave right now: Remove this page carefully and make a backup.
With all the people in the Roman report, you are very well acquainted with Mr. Englund, and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a mother - in the moments when you will feel like men and women in the history of different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new location at the Swedish Academy that makes Nobel's price for literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite a little bit like "antihistoric work".
It contains a number of very well-known names, important treaties or famous bets, but it is almost lacking in heights, energy journalists and the debate on tactics and equipment.
It's not even the book about what happened, the author explains, as you read, "the book about what it was." It's mainly about "feels, insights, experiences and innovations."
"The beauty and charm" in itself combines the war experiences of 20 more men and women, both on the sides of the baricade, from students and botanists to hooligans, doctors, rescue commanders and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, they come to the end, they get hurt, or they die.
Their lives are moving like the flames of the candles burned in the churches - new ones are added to the website of the courts while others are arrested.
Mr. Englund's book looks like classic historical novels.
It holds the idea that the first world war was only about the horrors of the Western front.
"The beauty and charm" is also thoroughly researching other places where the war dramas were held: Alpy, Balkans, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems by putting in their nests, have to spend the Christmas in a pyramid scene or they get involved with the presence of the mobs.
From the beginning, it's about very clever reading.
The storm will blow people's lives like a natural disaster, like a hurricane of Katrina that's coming down with a shooting job.
If you start to call a gun in the distance and you're a woman who's home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's really getting close?
No one's gonna understand what's going on, even why the whole war was over.
"Vacuum resulting from lack of facts," Mr. Englund pointed out, "was filled with events, ideas, hopes, concerns, premises, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fams."
"The beauty and charm" follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seaman serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are everywhere taken from life stories, letters, and other published material.
The descriptions of their lives can sound frightening and shocking, but with the inclusion of small moments and details, they are simply alive and reliable.
A lot of them are talking about shooting and comparing with him.
In the history of the German students, the author says, "The monsters, the same monsters everywhere."
"Cathropy, similar to pellets, rubber imitations, paper bindings, wooden buttons."
He's still going on, and he's describing food packs in Germany.
It is mentioned that "mass made of liquefied rice burned in the cup (and filled with false bone from the wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried brombores, bottled with wooden floor coverings".
It states that there were "837 registered batches and 511 registered coffee bags".
Some stories are about honesty and honesty.
One American in itself has internal ambitions for divorcism and brutality, which is about war, saying: "At last you realize that this is a very human nature. Never sit in comfortable circles with cigarettes and whiskeys, evening newspapers or good books, and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that behind it, I don't hide any bar in the hole."
On the contrary, the British army realizes that with the greatest likelihood of death soon, no one will even realize it, nor will he suffer.
"If a person finally makes peace with his sacrifice, he would at least expect it to happen before the air of the grateful public," he writes.
But instead, it looks like a "resurrection that keeps it secret."
Further notes relate to the departure of old Europe and the introduction of new toys.
"The conflict has become more and more economic competition and competitive," says Mr. Englund, "with all the companies."
He understood what it says "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a brilliant and ideologically inspired mass murder in the shadows of peace that carries out its bloodshed, without getting up from the table."
People behave in an unexpected manner, the seriousness of being proud.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sort of physical illness to get away from the front.
"The worst example of this behavior was the trade with the gonockey knife that soldiers bought and sold to him was the hope that he would end up in the hospital," he writes.
"You're the most reliable one who's got him in the eye, which has often been hidden until the end of life."
In this translation from Sweden from Peter Gravese, Mr. England's prose is fresh, but it has never been shown, which is a great deal on his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, it encourages the way in which the war "extremeless forces have been dealt with: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to wonder why their leaders need to fight.
The best books on the first world war were much more than the complex report worked with marks, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussel or Romans as "On the Western Front of Peace" by Eric Mari Remarquea.
Mr. Englund gives priority to the non-conventional hatred.
His book has the most striking endings, which in popular educational literature has no periods.
But I don't give it to you.
You will, however, seem like the author jumps out of the book at once, throws out a page with a list of handguns and burns it.
After an error has occurred, please correct the situation in the past minute.
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in the shelters used in street rooms.
The night from Monday to Friday was chosen because Zuccotti park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew of the action except a few high-ranked officers.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted the problems the police department had to face in the operation.
Cases were not to be repeated in recent weeks when, for example, the use of pipe receptions against demonstrators, which violated the rules of division, and the public sympathies were also passed on to the squatters.
For this reason, police operations aimed at cleaning Zuccotti's park from demonstrators began until after two weeks of thorough planning and exercise.
The leading representatives were allowed to inspire more advanced operations in other cities.
Massive exercises for behaviour in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island, which was ready for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have launched a similar training to address the problems - anti-terrorist measures involving the rapid transfer of a large number of police - with the aim of the city's Lever Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The results of the transfer to the park came the phrase "last minute" by someone whose action was originally explained only as "mixing".
"I know a few police officers who were also allowed to do this, and no one told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only under the condition that he would stay in anonymity.
"On his way to Zuccotti Park, he knew only the highest level of membership."
One of the reasons for the arrest was the lesson that the city had already received.
On October 14, the city representatives had to clean up the park, but then they came up from the plan, because as soon as they heard of the demonstration, they were gathered before the operation started in the park all over the place.
Subsequent actions have participated police from various units, including key groups from around the globe - dozens of police officers who are often used to strengthen the fourth with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, there's a lot of people coming to the park and coming back, so one hour at night was the perfect time when the action started.
"It was appropriate to carry out this at a time when at least people would be in the park," he declared.
Before the units appeared, they assembled at the distance of the street of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge bridge, cost vehicles of manufacturing units with cloud lamps and amplions.
The light and the recorded message from the amplions of many demonstrators scared.
When members of order units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators took their things and left.
The police claim that until 1:45 in the morning, she didn't touch the only apartment she wanted to give the demonstrators time to get things done.
Other police teams were taken as they were gathered at the end of the park so that they could get away with it if there was a need for arrests.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the chief speaker of the police department, said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists take the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and in addition some police officers were acting rudely to her.
Mr. Browne said that television cars at Church Street leading the western border of the park could be found without problems.
The police acted in the western direction and complained about the massive shift of personal protesting things, including the hostages and the impenetrable bags of clothes, and the hygienic division teams immediately collected everything left in the park.
Some of the demonstrators who refused to move were expelled from the park. Documentary educational materials appeared shortly after the internet.
The most destructive group of demonstrators got close to the kitchen in their camp, which was close to the middle of the park.
Some of them created a trap and the police started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people brought them to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were allowed to cross the barriers.
By 3:30 a.m., there was no arrest in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, a police statement was made.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
The majority of the arrests were due to "organisation of the detention and detention of the arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, was the highest established uniformed officer in the department.
The operation also participated personally in Phil T. Pulaski, chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't take part in the operation," said Mr. Browne.
The second group of police were waiting on the east side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if it needed to be allowed.
On the Cortlandt Street street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine Street street, a block south of the park, were pulled back.
From these places, the police developed a protective dog from Zuccotti Park.
In one place there were police officers, many of whom had been equipped with protection, as people still drew out beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the north border.
The most amazing night's action has taken south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, there was a demonstration south of Pine Street as he jumped into the police car cap, and several others who had released the air from the pneumatic police supply.
One minute from the roof, he flew off the bridge.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protestant were hospitalized.
The committee's group of assistant workers will complain of the city for release
The Committees representing hundreds of school assistant workers who came to work last month planned to appeal to the city. It claims that the release was unnecessary and was not necessary for discrimination due to an unintended impact on schools visiting poor students.
The Court of Justice is likely to have the latest possibilities left to the committees in the District Council 37 in their efforts to reverse the exemption decision.
In October, six hundred and twenty school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees of the city lost their jobs. Their exemptions from the management committees of the city were described as compensation for not having access to the health care fund made available to workers who wanted to cover the rent in the budget.
The representatives of the city rejected this charge categorically.
At the meeting of the City Council that took place last month, the Minister of School of Dennis M. Walcott said that the exemption was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately argued that there was no specific reference in the budget to the exemption of auxiliary workers.
The representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and assured the Ministry of Education that they would complain about it.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education will be indicted in the process, while the complainant will be eight fired workers, all of whom are Africans or Hispanics, as are most of the other assistants who have come to work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a lawyer from the city's legal department, said that the city had not yet seen a complaint, and that is why it will not be disclosed to each accused.
According to the scheme of the difficulties that occurred in New York Times, the councils focused on the number of people left in the poor parts of the city who wanted to support their claims about unfair conduct. They also maintain the view that the poor schools had come to more than a dozen assistants, because they have long been exposed to sufficient financial resources.
They show that while in schools in the Staten Island part was not allowed at all and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, part 23 in Brownsville, there were 17 school assistants, and in the District 8 and 9 parts in South Bronx, up to 46 attended.
He recalls that in public school 36 in Harlem, he lost five out of eight assistants, despite the school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The complaint says, "It's not about the presence of full-time mobile parents who can have financial resources to balance the gap in the budget."
The number of public school schools 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year and the school also came with money when the city changed the method of calculating bonus funds for every poor student reported.
In addition, the Committee argues that the principals of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which the document approved the release of parental coordinators.
The document used the term "excess" to be deleted, although this word is often used to describe the transfer of teachers from the payroll to the database of available workers, which may be played by the central authority.
"Six hundred parents' coordinators have been released," they say on the proposal of complexity, "and they have not only moved to the database to the position of available workers."
Mass is at the end, Congress is ready to agree on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress agree on something about the rise in Libya.
Before that came, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Kaddáfi had to be arrested and killed and the participation of the United States unit was terminated.
On Tuesday, the Commission will decide on an expression supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which he should congratulate the Libyans for their successful rise and American unity.
"In this statement we want to assess the attitude of the Libyan people who started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Two sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts."
The sciences mentioned may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has ever been easy.
During the years, the lawmakers on both sides continued to agree with the White House on a change in the order of declaration to approve or reject the military role of the United States of America in NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented resolutions that allowed the use of American armed forces in Libya to be restricted.
The proposal was rejected in Snow due to the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted for in the Senate.
On that same day, when this proposal was rejected in Snowmow, the chamber also withdrew measures that would stop financing American operations in Libya.
The United States mission in Libya has seen history in the legislative cleaning process - Congress has criticised the way President Obama is directing the mission, but his members have obviously failed to do so in order to stop supporting him in his beginning.
In the end, the audience of the Congress foretold other events.
The rebels arrived in Tripoli in August and on October 20th he was killed by Kaddáfi.
Miss Nato officially finished October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to meet.
The Commission for International Relations in its Declaration "gratually congratulates Libya's citizens for their unmeaning attitude and the amazing sustainability they have put in their efforts to free their people" and "glorify men and women of armed forces in the United States and their associations who have engaged in operations in the protection of Libya's population, for extraordinary nationality and professionality."
The declaration also states that "the United States' national interest in the successful and irrevocable transition to democracy in Libya is confirmed."
Is the Commission fully supported by a new proposal for international relations, or will the legislators be divided again into two and a half, as it was when the Green Proposal was adopted?
On the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), chief representative of the Republican Party, was appointed to the Commission.
Lugar's speech on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal has not yet been seen.
In November this week, we will vote on an addendum to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for nearly all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, sponsored by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution relating to the budget or other topics to which the whole of the Snow or the Senate will vote.
The other legislators have not yet been able to reach their own vote by a significant amount.
The Goodlatt proposal is only one of the 68 additions to the constitutions presented at the convention and dealt with a wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal as the Snow and the Snow - and others are only minor exchanges of others.
Only in Snow can you find at least 15 versions of an addendum on a balanced budget and another item that would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are quite clear, but their residences - especially the starting republicans who want to improve their history - can be shaken by their "authority".
The regulation of the budget approved in August required that Snæmovna and Senat vote on the addendum relating to the corresponding budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of an unnecessary declaration of support for the outcome of such an addendum.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to extend the number of periods during which members of the Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods to be held by the President.
Vice-President Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole range of supplements that would in addition guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an addendum prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and an addition prohibiting the burning of state trains.
Some legislators also want to enable the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the States are against it.
Although it appears that the members of the Congress are very active in proposing various additives, compared with the previous years, they are not clearly separated from the average.
At 111, 77 additional volunteers were offered at the 111th Congress, while at the 100th Congress they were 66.
Their activities are even seen in comparison with the beginning of the 90th century when, according to the statistics, the Senate library members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they have not been much more successful than modern politics.
The last addendum added - 27th addendum - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Between, but not broken," says Gifford in his first TV conversation from the shooting.
Ten months after her uninterrupted approach to the shooting, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on the national television on Monday evening, sang with melodic from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and announced that more than coming back to Congress is about to be healed.
Giffords appeared in the series "20/20" at ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of the wind still makes her problems and needed help when she fell.
The whole series documented her difficult reconvalence, which was necessary because of the damage caused by the lung that had spread to her in front, caused her left half of her brain and left her out of the head.
Three months ago, she was surprised to return to Snow so that she could vote on the debt ceiling.
During his first television interview from the ice shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed, laughed, and sang - while his exclamation described him as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she answered the four-year-old Gifford, "It's okay."
The discussion with Gifford's and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the clock special part of the series "20/20", which was sent in the morning to publish a new book on this couple, called "Gabby: The Experience and Hope".
Specially, he watched the entire Gifford reconvalence from the 8th of January.
On videos surrounding Kelly during the first week, you can see Gifford's hospital bed with a long head and face all over the head.
While her husband wakes her up, she can't do more than one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Gifford was arrested as he sits in a wheelchair and learned how to perform simple tasks.
Head-up.
It's a cut-off.
And then, her first word, "Co."
During a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast", when he asked for changes in his breakfast.
The video released by ABC shows that the critical role of playing Gifford's music is: Congressman sings them together with the therapist on melody to the song "Girls Just Wana Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During his conversation with Gifford, who spent two hours each day in therapy, Sawyer revealed that he had nothing to remember since the day he arrived at the shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford had read the news articles on shooting until 12 March, when she first asked who was the six who had been killed in the incident.
The shooting was suspected by Jared Lee Loughner, who was detained in the Missouri prison, where he waited for a trial.
"A lot of people died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Great, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that his wife once declared during the reconvalence, "I was playing."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly wrote.
"Because you got the boot.
But you'll do it, you'll be together, and you'll get back stronger than before."
Military units meet with a more sensitive conscience than the officer
This event was a golf course on Wall Street, which brought millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who don't have an arrow on their head.
Kid Rock's singing a ball of weakness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, mariners, planes and mariners ran around him.
The gloriously dressed tax was lifted up and pressed upward.
"The men and women serving in the army were considered to be heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the iron benefit.
On the evening of the ceremony, he also attended the next president of the Committee of Heads of State. In addition to him, he was an admiral of Mike Mullen, who, however, saw the role of military units in a different way.
"All were represented as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought it was good.
I know you do.
Just what I saw wasn't an account, it was a pity.
Thus, in a simple way, accurate knowledge only illustrates a narrow relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes praising the American public.
The army is immediately included in praise of its victims.
It's just that these praise stands for something, the soldiers say.
The public continues to behave more and more like a unit in a uniform.
"We're not a victim," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who is a lot of units in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"Because it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us into the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to the military leaders who do not want to look thankless or show their relationship with the public they serve.
They also realize that the fire that had to be fired by the units that were ever back from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the terms of suffering are spoken in silence and in particular between war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from the war activities where they served as members of the marine crew, their father warned them that people outside the army would be seen from two responsibilities.
Some will feel respect and admiration for them because they have broken up their enemies and visited exotic places.
On the other hand, he will turn his head if "he doesn't hide evil under the surface, violent veteran," said Cancian, who participated in the wars in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government after his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, so some people who talked to him suddenly pointed out that soon after the war returned, he would be able to overcome the stress associated with work in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count with negative reactions," Cancian taught his son.
The grief of the army is partly due to the American resistance to war.
The success of the vital police is only a small obstacle to recognition in a country that has only limited knowledge of its own army and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is only a little of its own success.
"As a nation we no longer regard the military army as usual for the second world war," declared Lieutenant General David Barno, who was a large American unit in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public focuses mainly on the torture of men in arms.
Soldiers are noted for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to make a firm stand against rape
This week will determine whether 28 women and men will be brought into trial for alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, they are prepared to submit a request to the other sponsors.
Elizabeth Lyman's first military class was on the night when she was officially raped by her army colleague 25 years old and was in the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she was on a plane-based Miramar north of San Diego. After dinner, she met a friend of her male non-smoker with 12 beer.
He asked her if she could join her, so they could have a little drink in her room.
"In my head, a bright light shined," Lyman wrote.
Only the native Texasan simply ignored her intentions.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after she went to her room, her husband passed her to bed and raped her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present or former members of the army will wait for a hearing worth which could have a historical impact. This will be played in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be held before the trial of the former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld were in a fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The charges were handed on by Washington Lawyer Susan Burke and the complaining party at the time had 17 members. However, during the following months their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their fellow members in the army and that the army, after the announcement of these attacks, had landed in the investigation, torture and any trial of justice.
Burke says he's going after the church to the highest established army leaders, because the problem starts right at them.
"Armada is a directive system," she says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to take the effort to take action against such acts?
Burke also claims that she contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of the other claims made in the future.
Its strategy: More than collecting all charges on this case - has put all the eggs into one basket, as she says, in many different cases, if it is necessary to prevent the pressure.
The defence team shall be led by the representatives of the United States of America, Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, has given the case adjourned.
The case-law documents received by Newsweek describe in detail the defence strategies - essentially the fact that the current or former soldiers cannot complain of any injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under the regulation of the Supreme Court of 1950 called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Criminal injury concerns the military service of the complainants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused to disclose this matter.
However, knowledge has changed since the 1960s.
Although women still can't officially serve in the war, it's only a dictionary: in modern wars it can only be difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's troops played an even more prominent role, particularly in the field of communication with civil women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for modernization to come into the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, except for three other legal representatives.
At Yale's law school, visitors to the veterranian seminar on legal services are preparing to appeal to the four main military academy for the supposed development of the atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Depending on this, the non-profit organisation of the American Vietnamese veterans collects the basis for its demand for a measure against the army. This application is aimed at the diagnosis of "manage injuries", which was clearly found in the victim's sacrifice of rape to have a memory for their release - according to activists, for example, Anu Bhagwatio, who belongs to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a simple practice.
Her group had already proposed a complaint against the State organisation for dealing with a vet, which was accused of discriminatory practices that had to come to the processing of applications for assistance from persons claiming to have been sexually attacked in the service.
At the Congress, nine independent proposals were presented by a group of senators and Members from both sides of the political party and proposed a series of corrective measures.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported by the Ministry of Defence, according to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to its own findings, the number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In the report published in March, there was also a reduction in the level of alleged criminal conduct: In 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army were reported to the court - half of which was to be dealt with by the civil justice system.
In the event of an invasion of Burke, the complainants only describe attacks as the first of the whole series of traumatizations.
For example, the first class of Lyman's army reported a reported violent attack by the military police not long after what was supposed to happen to him.
During the night, she said, it was requested that details of her rape be packed at least once to various members of the police, doctors and leaders.
She submitted all the tests necessary for the determination of rape and found the blood of an attacker - from the wounds she had taken care of.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman concluded his hearing before the court during which she was asked questions about whether she had been in love with her friend on the day of the attack.
There were six persons who, as witnesses of the history, were appointed in the favor of a certain witness who was finally released from prison.
"I remember the day the trial was brought," said Lyman.
"I had the feeling that I was born right there - I ran away from the court of justice."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my superior officer, "He wasn't his judge. He was mine."
Lyman's orders were to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder that indicated her unable to serve.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without a warrant and a warrant.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other complainants goes to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to enter into further stages of the administration."
However, among them are the aforementioned doctrine that has been criticized since the first time that the light of the world has been seen.
I'm myself a lifelong critic of the teaching of Feres Doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because their duties cannot maintain the same peace of motivationary and threatening means.
He adds, "The chances are tough against him... but it's important for them to try it."
It's only when good people are willing to fight.
In the absence of a decision in their favour, Burkevoá, the lawyer of the complainants, shall gather hundreds of other persons ready to submit the complaint and shall start working on other matters relating to this matter.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue since the reform comes," he says.
Or until we die, according to what's going on before.
The Jews have eyes: How scientists test you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face to legal extremism in Europe, he was only another young man who presented his anti-corruption views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who admitted to the Russian massacre, after which 77 people died in Norway, participated in his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could be alone, he was definitely not unique in the cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on the computer during the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the legal groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of the year, scientists want to learn more about these people.
Just how to find her?
It's easy - it's enough to appear on Facebook.
"We realized that meeting them is not really so difficult," said Jamie Bartlett, the chief author recently published a report to the British research team on European digital population.
The collection of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett, that scientists have made it easy for them to use the advertising on the pages and because of the simplicity of this, they have determined the search for a demographic group - something the marketing workers have been doing for years.
The Bartletts team, on the other hand, found half a million fans of the right groups, focusing on them and sending them insulations. However, instead of calling them to a new emerging group or offering them some diet products, they called for the completion of the questionnaire in which issues related to their level of education, violence and optimism were raised in view of their own future.
By means of Facebook with Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 fans of 14 different legal groups in 11 European countries were able to obtain results - without even leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett points out.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line standouts of legal groups are everywhere young men who promote growing mobility.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain hidden behind a computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers are using these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends, covering posts, dental contributions and printed clicks "I like them".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data per day, making from this social network the term "information supernova", which stands for the development of a lot of new research. The number of academics in which the word Facebook is provided has increased to around 800% over the past five years.
For some scientists, Facebook was shocked by the fact that it allows people to study without having to burden them somewhere on the street.
"It was previously paid that if you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where you'd never be left," Bartlett says.
"This all Facebook cancels - you're just going straight to him."
Others claim that the website can offer a way to identify and avoid social-health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of Wisconsin University, a research team found that university students who collected their opioids on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were involved in this subject.
Moreno suggests that the authors of the site monitor and come with the student's offer, which publishs too many opulent status.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can't diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren's and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Child Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify threatened children, who we should not otherwise be able to reveal."
Facebook itself constantly scans the data of its users.
The information team has developed statistics on the relevance of the relevant status and days of Valentine, voluntary participation in 2010 and the population’s peace coefficient (especially with the use of information available to them - the rest of the Internet freedom has long claimed that the website should have its own information base to access research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - instead of being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide its personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research that they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly different rules on how to collect offline data. However, online data is available to everyone.
"I think most of the users didn't even think that scientists could observe their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, who conducted a 2006 study using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"If it was about them, they read it so they're only information between them and their friends."
The following is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even when looking off-line, there is no guarantee that the entity is simply honest.
On Facebook it is never possible to verify how much information on the profile and contributions to the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two very different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who spent years researching new technologies, thinks that the complainant and the writer still remain the best tool that can be used in the research.
"If you go out in the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't repay," he says.
"Societal research should be about society and community activities - and the hell of a lot of community activities is still playing off-line."
"Further and Negede": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public court review
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who admitted to two attacks during the summer of Norway, killed 77 people during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter.
"I'm a military leader in the Norse Controversy and among the Norse Temple Ritters," he announced before the court, where 500 people were gathered.
"I am proud of the appeal against the court because your orders have given you an organization that supports the ideology of hate and supports multiculturalism."
"I know my actions, but I don't admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he wanted to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could vote for his views."
For the same reason, he refused to give Breivick, who brought his prepared word, to the end of the hearing of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for the next 12 weeks, prohibiting him from any medium contact within 4 weeks and informing him that the competent authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence within eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 victims and survivors.
Some have come to hope that they will be able to look at Breivick's eyes, others to make sure he's held firmly under the cover.
All were involved with the purpose of taking a quick closure case.
"It seemed to me that he seemed cold and uneducated," said the NRK commentators one of the survivors of the attack.
"It wasn't a pleasant thing, but I can say to myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved mentally a little further."
Breivik, in dark clothing and blue tie, remained throughout the whole time of hearing calm and professional. At the arrival and departure to the building without difficulty, looking at the present journalists and living in the eye.
Despite Breivick's strange idea that he was part of a major "response" strike, the judge said he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he would have a partner.
For someone, it may be a surprise that the 22 June attacks appear to be the work of the only extremists and no radical groups.
However, this does not automatically reduce the confusion and confusion that remain in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I'd come up to look like a creature, but it isn't," said one of the victims.
"If yes, everything would be much simpler."
7 lessons from the lost conversation with Steve Jobs in the film, measuring to kin this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, people who compared him to Henry Ford - and chose him for his genius as the greatest modern explorer.
At a recent reopened Job's conversation, which was forgiven for a special film that goes to the cinema this week, will be for all the fans of Apple's company that his creative thought has been perfectly understood by the commercial processes and working flows of his products.
He was a great designer, artist and self-sustaining member of hippie, but also a pedant organizer and man, who every detail of the ship, believed that many businessmen were suffering from "a really great idea of 90 percent of their work... [but] among excellent ideas and excellent resulting product is still a long road to work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on a TV series of Triumf computers that communicated about the world of personal computers. During the interview, he was played uniquely, more than an hour talk.
At the time, it was ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands with his new computer company NeXT, and was impatiently looking at how wide the public will take the internet.
Finally, the TV series used only a brief part of Cringely’s entire conversation and the original copies of the interview were sold to be lost in transport.
Soon after Job’s death, however, VHS copies were found in the registry garage.
Right this material, gently assembled, creates the basis of a 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which measures to the selected kines this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who expressed his lack of interest in giving further talks, Jobs here has a surprising reason to be surprised that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it's also shown as a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the discussion it will be said that between the question and the answer there will be a further pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thought when you see how Jobs' answer perfectly thought to be the highest and most accurate one.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism on the surface, when the questions of Cringley cause him to be impatient and move him to get to the more important problems and issues.
The discussion was set up before the euro of Pixar, iPod or iPhone and appeared in it to be extremely prophetic when Jobs values what other companies do good and bad while offering their own vision of the future on the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Job’s death assessment, but on Job’s, which we see here as a breathless picture in the context of his genius, is something serious and inspiring.
He has his own vision of how things might and should look.
Not long ago, and after expressing his views, he also began to introduce himself to practice.
The rapid sum of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which are determined to highlight:
How the company learned to run:
"During the business year, I always asked, "Why do you do this?" And the answer was always the same: Well, that's just what it does."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, he's never thinking about things about business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify accounting in Apple's company.
He was simply confused by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with the letter "standard costs", about which he could just think of. At the time, he decided to open his own way - he developed an automatic tool that promised that commercial costs could be determined within a few minutes.
As he carried out the plant on the paper:
Jobs mentions the "Modrau krabica", which he saw with Steve Wozniek - a device that enabled people to make effective use of the phone company and to call anywhere in the world free of charge.
The device was already written in the past, but Job’s inspiration, when he described the Modra as a powerful tool, is quite impressive.
They tested with Vozniak the device using a flat phone and were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another while using the largest number of satellites.
"At least half of the time, we've gone so far around the world, so when we got something stuck in the pay phone, it came back a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found out that we could do something that was capable of managing the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
We made ourselves two little thing that could control a lot more work - it was an incredible experience and I think it would never happen to Apple without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the garden that Vozniak and Wozniek almost got to the end. Through the middle of the night, they called on the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, while they were looking for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, they were allowed to continue the establishment of the Catholic Church to talk to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up on the phone, the two of them looked up and listened.
How he loved technology (and called Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he had a paycheck so he could set a mile, he found Bill Hewletta on the phone list and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs already had an summer Brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"Unbelievably, it was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what this company really is and how to deal with its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever built."
He was like a cop, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager, I made up and up in the HP, I looked around that computer and started to write programs for him.
How innovations think:
In some places Jobs is talking about how new products are invented during the conversation.
At the beginning of his career, when he was selling a couple of dozens with a flat connection, one customer asked him to set up a total computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to think, analyze and add the device.
When he was later in Apple's company, he mentioned the problems that resulted in the development of computer mouse:
"I remember how we got quite wild... shouting at me that it would take five years [to set up a 300-dollar mouse] when I stopped playing, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfect balance mouse for $15.
As a large company comes to the roof:
Long before Apple’s resurrection, Jobs clearly predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would corrupt and lose their share in the market.
"Let's say you're working in IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or prints, so what's next?"
You have a monopol market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At the moment, the government has already decided to leave and marketing, so the companies are taking over people who are in their old age, while people who are in their own age are excluded from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that society has brought to its undisputed position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - generosity and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox's company...
Xerox was able to own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she was, she could've been Microsoft in the 1990s...
However, the place of victory was a failure.
How to take innovation as a form of art:
"Among the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product is still a long way and a lot of work... and as this wonderful idea develops, it changes and expands."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to join a series of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factory to do don't stop.
You have to remember 5,000 things - different concepts - and build them together...
Finally, it depends on the experience - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a certain way try to avoid what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed that I've got the best ideas.
Macintosh's company was so wonderful and successful that the people who worked in it were excellent singers, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, amazing things would happen in all other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with a violation of the Health Care Act at the time of their trial
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a political controversial question, whether he would take action against President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in the celebration of the ceremony with a sponsored legal firm who would participate before the court.
It happened last Thursday, when all nine judges came to discuss the proposed proposals.
One of the cases identified was the complaint brought by 26 States that had failed radical treatment of medical care, which had been approved by the Congress - a law that had mobilized conservatives around the world.
The judges agreed that the complaint would be heard. However, in March the 5.5-hour meeting is expected, with the result of further expanding the presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be fully implemented in the course of the decision.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and will try to find out how to break the law will be with the highest probability Paul Clement, who served as the general prosecutor of the United States for George W. Bushe.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of about two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinners of the Federalist Society, which has been in violation of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that was sponsoring dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade unions that are breaking the law, i.e. the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process in the range of financial resources.
A few hours after the trial was held at the Washington hotel on the subject of the case.
She also participated in the participation of Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and a certified upholder of the Health Care Act.
What about the introduction of a guest?
It's nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Group for years.
And it's definitely not about anything that would be contrary to ethical rules.
In fact, these judges are free to comply with the principles of conduct that lower federal courts have.
In the absence of this, however, their conduct would inevitably fall under the principle of C4, which states that "the judge may take part in actions that are directly related to and other organisations for the purpose of obtaining financial resources, the judge shall not be a speaker, a honourable guest, nor shall he be placed on the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms that are affected in the case, as well as companies with a vast financial interest in this case, has proved rich enough to warn the activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and intolerance against the code of conduct is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting in accordance with the same rules that it pays for all other federal courts," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause organization.
"The judges drank and ate on social benefits together with legal representatives waiting for their case to be heard before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining financial means through this action will cover the feet with all claims of incompatibility which are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed only a little understanding and showed them that they also combine their judicial obligations with the actions of the group, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a highly established conservative activist.
Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is mainly caused by Judge Elena Kagan and not by Scalia and Thomas.
Kaganov worked as a general prosecutor for the government of President Obama when the first charges against the law appeared before the court.
Kagan’s critics pressure her to take part in the case and claim that she was fighting so much that she could not be involved at the time.
Kagan's never meant she'd want to give up.
Boeing received a record order on a aircraft operating value of 18 billion USD
Emmirates Airlines command 50 two-wheeled Boeing 777 aircraft with 20 other possibilities.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner flights by Aman Air, which invests more than $1 billion.
When a company gets orders on 50 pieces of its products, it's mostly no reason to celebrate.
However, if this company is a manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50-year-olds makes a total of USD 18 billion, that is something else.
The same important message is where Boeing obtained the order: Average output, expanding gold for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued in the Czech Republic, the average airline in the Middle East will require 2,520 flights in the amount of USD 450 billion in the next 20 years.
The Boeing company announced its greatest order on the weekend in history regarding the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 two-way Boeing 777.
The warrant came from the Emmirates Air Force station in Dubai.
Boeing’s company at the 2011 Airport Dubai Air Show reported that airlines have the opportunity to buy another 20 flights, which would result in a total of $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air airline had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is significantly better consumed by fuel and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six flights exceeds $1 billion.
"It's an excellent report for Boeing's entire company," said Neal Dihora, an analysis for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
A lot of aeroplanes on the Middle East belong to darker nations with heavy roofs.
This means that they have not only money to pay the aircraft, but the increase in prices of low prices - most harmful airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so profitable because the country alone produces at higher prices of clothing.
This is important because they are not as likely as any other aircraft, so that they can steal or discard aircraft orders due to the increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," she says.
The Emirates Aeroline Convention aligns Boeing's leading position on the market with a wide range of aircraft and leads to the Airbus SAS, which sought to undermine Boeing's dominants with its transport model A350.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after the Airbus representatives announced that it will be reimbursed for their first year of their largest A350 flight, which is the direct competitor of 777-300ER.
The withdrawal was due to the customer's request for a more favourable charge of aircraft and aircraft, so the manufacturer took time to enable the engine to add more power to the engine.
The price of the Boeing company which increased by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
The Mexican President's sister was defeated according to everything in the Michoacán elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faustov Vallejon of the PRI, helped the government's drug dealers in the battle.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderona lost her position in the violent state elections in Michoacán, and on Monday she announced that one of her opponents helped drug dealers win.
The preliminary results were accompanied by guidance in government elections in the western state of Faustov Vallej by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI.
"The involvement of members of organised crime in the entire voluntary process and in particular in the previous period of solo elections is alarming not only for Michoacán but for our country as a whole," said Luis Maria Calderon, in a talk for the radio day after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion group... they were playing volleyballs, they set up road patrols... and they let people vote for the PRI order.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when the Presidency arrived.
However, he plans a quick return to power and victory in the battles in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to welcome also in June in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo was defeating Calderon, who was still leading the day before the elections, just very quiet.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for his brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejona as a winner.
The third was directed by Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or a PPD, which has so far been under the authority of the government. For the challenged and persecuted party, the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results for payment.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state, named Morelia, refuses any relationship with drug dealers and sends out other candidates for recognition of results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
One of the parents of President Calderona and right in Michoacán in December 2006 began a military war against the rebels.
Violence, however, has continued.
An elderly PAN, Colonel Luisy Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the elections, and many of the candidates for the election turned away from fear.
However, whether the results of the elections in Michoacán appear to be due to the PRI side, victory on the side will help to achieve a new momentum.
The expected representatives of the PRI party in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington Vallej, welcomed and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
The ADB Bank calls Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could lead to the overall decline of the world economy, which would have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of the ADB Bank, sitting in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help speed up the settlement of the exchange block through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are following all European difficulties as soon as possible and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and resources will help to guarantee a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So everyone who could help Europe out of the crisis," said for Financial Times during the discussion at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asie may be protected to some extent, but definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do so."
The European Monetary Union has been severely tested for several months by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's cost of loans has been high and the government of Italy and Greece has abandoned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could resume its recession, and calls for new emerging economies to join and help the Eurozone find solutions.
Mr. Nag suggested that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that substantial aid - such as the purchase of debt funds from the European Union Fund for Financial Stability institutions - would give Asian partners European countries greater opportunities.
And Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do what it can to help Eurozone," because her own economy now suffers from the decline in exports and the removal of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and unsatisfied," he declared.
"We are facing a difficult task, and we must maintain high peace of mind."
"It's not an alternative, it's a big fact, because otherwise we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as this index, have nothing to do with helping European economies when they have to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Warsaw, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult to explain political aid for Europe 1.2 billion people if 800 million of them live from 2 USD or less a day.
"One could find out that the Greeks are going to pay their taxes in the fall and enjoy their freedom on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, likewise wondered why there should be Indian resources used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in bad and lost sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag pointed out that the Eurozone crisis is threatening the "dangerous domain effect".
The Bank's suggestion that in Asia, between 2011/2012, up to 7.5% of economic growth is now facing a "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets must create "unexpected expenditure plans" in order to protect them from the decline and the significant impact of capital from their economies.
Warnings from the Pentagon regarding possible weapons in the area of defence
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta at the Congress held on Monday, while ensuring that the rising automatic shield in the budget can threaten national security and create a financial network response that begins at Pentecost and continues through the war in Afghanistan to civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon will now have to spend a reduction of $450 billion in the next ten years, while now the decrease of $600 billion is feared if Congress is unable to conclude the cost agreement.
"The consequences of these massacres would be for the entire resort to destroy," wrote Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the sudden existence of the so-called establishment would result in 23% of the holiday decline and the suspension of many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this unreasonable way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three fourths of buildings or ships. Furthermore, it could result in serious damage to other modernization powers," wrote the Senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction has to take place so quickly, we will certainly have to send civilians to a nude permit to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can be broken by the belief of those who care about our army and seriously damage its preparation."
Finally, the victims were attacked by the war units, known as Panetta.
"Since the accounts for financing possible military operations in the sea will not be directly affected by this presence, the darker operations will be adversely affected by significant changes in the other budgets," Panetta warned.
"It comes to the victims and to the contractual staff, which will result in the delay of the contract contracts supporting the military efforts of our people."
"The situation of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and subsequent infringements of legal and political support."
The senators of the Pannett signed down ten days ago and asked him for details regarding the possible consequences of automatic assaults on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the presence of the Ministry of Defence could lead to a rapid deterioration of the view of the United States as a world military force."
"We are strictly against this strong measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published the Pannetts letter.
"It's not about the conclusion that we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The planned massacres are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It is first to see if Panett's letter and the clean warning increase the pressure on Congress to begin counting and raise voices calling for the withdrawal of the Pentagon from the list of secret areas.
In recent years, Panetta has been talking about possible gaps that are even more open, although she herself has passed on her high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets at Congress and the White House, so she knows she's going to go to war here.
At the press conference organized by the Minister of Defence for a minute of a week, the Minister of Defence pointed out a specific picture of what his resort can expect - a step in the army within which the core will fail.
"It will be like a ship without seamen."
"It'll be like a brigade without a munch."
"It'll be like a plane without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, as a army of cashiers, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the speech in Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without moral, unprepared and unable to match possible enemies."
"As a result, the aggression will be won..."
The annex to McCain and Graham Panetta specifies how to reduce the consequences of "exhaustive operational risk: a late response to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; a clear limitation of the possibilities of disasters and siege throughout the world; an estimated unacceptable risk in future war operations."
In addition, the Panetta added that some of the biggest defence projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, and those that are even in the early stages of planning.
For example, on the list was the project F35, planned for a new bomber, a new generation ballistic anchor, a new coastal warship and a new underground vehicle that wanted the army and the marine wind to replace the Humvee.
The suspension of further development and testing of the F35 flight would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but the rest of it claims that it is a necessary step towards improving the arms required to cope with possible threats from China and other rivers.
How to recognize lies
The summer view of recent news headlines shows how serious and unambiguous lies and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has a full hand to work with the accusation that he has sexually charged several women - both sides claim that the other party is lying.
Directors at the University of Penn State were charged with a false witness when they tried to hide records of the retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested, as a failed microphone told American President Barrack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy all careers and close the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made himself mad when he published the information that was immediately issued with irrefutable evidence.
Former president John Edwards was accused of using funds from his campaign to try to escape his inhumane measure.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that shot around Bill Clinton when she lied during the second period about her sexual relationship with Monica Lewis.
It's just stupid stories about college and university leadership all over the place.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their students.
Mentors who should teach the poets send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
What do you think we're dealing with?
Studies show that in one day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let's assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that foreign people were caught three times during the first ten minutes of the first encounter in life.
Lying, or "recognition of lies", is an essential skill that should be overcome by anyone, whether for personal or for work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharade, when a person shouts, "I have you". The recognition of the complaint is a serious science sector that has been working with scientific data collected during the last six decades on prestigious universities during specific research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old lies were returned.
Lies look quietly at your eyes.
It's not like they're stuck, they're cactals, they're red or they're covered.
However, do not conclude that it is a difficult lie to warn and reveal.
A trained identifier may be able to distinguish the truth from literal buildings, small expressions in the face, the way in which questions are created and their timing.
I've spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a wide and developing field of understanding about lies, and it is clear that advertising is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be very helpful in today’s complex world - especially if there is between your work obligation to hire, organize conversations, conduct or conduct people.
Good liars can read well even in others, leave them in danger, guide their emotions, and intuitably know how the other parties are taking them.
From research we know that extraterrestrials lie more often than introverting that men offer more "meaning" lies, while women say more lies "designed to others" - mostly because of protecting some feelings - that women lie less often to their partners than free people (also, they say, most of them are "disgusting").
We also know that if you are considered a sinner, others will feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, take note of the normal behavior of the entity.
It's called "beginning."
Thanks to him, he'll have a later date to compare.
Note that the body of the entity, his smile, works with the voice.
You should know if someone usually keeps digging his feet so that you don't blame him for lying just because he's starting to cover his ass in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify the traps of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But Berte's just as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People who utter lies can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their thoughtful story, they can go to the door, move to the exit, clearly change the body's maintenance or give a name after the end of the conversation - transferred to a deep breath and a change of position when it is difficult to talk to them.
People performing conversations often issue a false signal that the interview is final, just to see how the wave will look after its end.
Take note of the language of the entity as well.
It's a famous story of how Scott Peterson once crossed over and used the past time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which had spread throughout the country after her body.
The complaining individuals can also express themselves straightly: "I didn't have any sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsko" or a difficult question they're completely concerned with.
The most common verbal signs are just very cautious.
Someone can use a lot of "meaning language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such an answer we do not know too much about the facts and often about another warning signal.
There is no wizard who would be able to expose every lie, but it is possible to win the skills that can be followed by the lie.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance of becoming a liar and a liar in his personal and working life.
The anti-competitive plan for the construction of a rotary attempt will be redirected after the threat of withdrawal from the US government's approval
A few days after Obama's government announced that it was willing to postpone the approval of a planned miner from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which was respected by the councils, but calmed the environmentalists - the company that had the structure announced it was willing to redirect the project so that things could move again.
The TransCanad company announced on Monday evening that the transfer of the planned route is attempting with the ecologically sensitive Sandhills region in Nebraska and is convinced that the project will also be approved.
This Decision was notified by the company at the press conference in the seat of the German government.
The Group of TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the building will finally be approved, although it will lead to another route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it rejected a decision on the federal permission of the project, where it did not conduct a study of possible recovery routes, which could not be included in the Sandhills region in Nebraska and in the Ogalla waters.
"This is a real move forward," said the Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological survey of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably have rejected any decision by 2013, so the next year after the elections, the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision.
In a written statement from last week, both described the decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed their support.
1,700 miles long effort will link Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Albert to the refinery in Texas, I daily store 700,000 barrels of roses.
This road will have to be hit by 6 states.
This project simply hates environmentalism, but it is loved by workers who believe that 20,000 new jobs are emerging at work.
However, the lawmakers in Nebraska set out against this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would help the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the Ogalla waters, the main source of drinking water and packaging.
The ongoing study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, as well as a source from the energy industry, said that the general inspector of the ministry had ordered a new review of the entire initial study process and focused on two questions.
For one thing, it was whether the lobbyist of TransCanad, Paul Elliott, who was counsellor Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not represent the programme of conflict of interest.
Further, did not the company assigned to the original study was selected inappropriately because it had a link to the TransCanada company.
Patti LaBelle is accused of causing her to panic.
The New Yorks family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle suddenly broke into their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so that she was afraid of it.
The performance of the singer's hit "Lady Marmalade" frightened the eight-month Genevieve Monk so much that she endured "a change of personality, a loss of sleep" and "an increased fear of strangers," her family claims in complaint to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th of last year, Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a teacher at school, and Genevieve arrived on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk got in the car, Roseanna Monk met down to their house in the Riverside Boulevard and did not go with him and Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and the baby stopped.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "You know what your daughter is doing?" I said "an" and I went to get her."
LaBelle's pregnant wife was a bit of a bit of a pity.
"The aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't have given your daughter to the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She was upset and started to talk out loud, and she screamed at the simpleest words...
She had a lashe with water and started to wait for me for water.
He claims Genevieve's got hysterical custody.
"I said to the woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter." The mother said to the child.
LaBelle was on her mother - who had been still in the arms of Genevieve - and had to stop her until her delivery, which followed her back into the waiting car, told Rosaanna Monk.
The girl cried so much when she got back, she added.
Later, the family wrote a letter in which LaBelle apologized, but they had no answers.
Lawyers and speakers LaBelle don't respond to our phones to express themselves all over the cause.
The application calls for a more unexplained, but family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans to hire all high-income money to a charitable organization that owes children cancer.
"The aim is to introduce Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is simply unacceptable, especially if it is intended against teachers from a school holding an eight-month-old child."
The impact of climate pollution on the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdze, unemployment and unemployment in Sinaloa increased, reduced foreign investment and with them and the economy
The year 2011 is marked by the economic events of Sinaloa. It is the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdeze, which calls for a change in government itself. This government has brought with it a great expectation that economic progress, however, due to unacceptable climate conditions at the beginning of the year, has not been recorded any growth and has even resulted in a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low environmental temperatures have caused millions of agricultural losses, obliging the possibility of growth in the state economy, have a tendency to reduce economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of this year. In the area of agriculture, this has also resulted in a historical decline of 31.16%, which has undermined dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damages were recorded on 582 835 hectares of land produced, 78.03% of which was completely destroyed and 21.07% were found to be partial damage.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, unemployment rates increased during the first three quarter of the year. From January to March 55, 55,053 citizens of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing the unemployment rate of 4,53% of the active population. In the second quarter unemployment increased to 5.28% and between Sweden and Serbia the average unemployment rate increased to 6.19%, representing approximately 74 000 unemployed people.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard Lópeze Cervantese, director of the UAS Institute of Economic and Social Sciences, it is possible to explain the growth of unemployment directly on the basis of the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of growing unemployment, which relates to various factors. Among them are other losses of liquidity on the market due to the restrictions of resources due to legislation adopted by the Congress in relation to the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally strengthen their dollars, it is not easy to make them, invest them or use them," he highlighted.
stop migration
López Cervantes pointed out that unemployment growth is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, to the United States has decreased, but this is due to a lack of access and then also because even though these people get outside the borders, it is difficult for them to get work. So people stay and ask for work from our state, and so unemployment grows," he said.
Inadmissibility
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsening due to increasing unemployment, which prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employees in the state are working without taking the taxes on social security.
Other labour market risks, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unemployment, and in this administrative area, the lowest payments from the whole country, as indicated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly reception of workers in Sinaloa was 5,352 p.m., deep under the national average, which moves to 7,375 p.m.
Derogation of foreign direct investment
In line with the decline in economic activity and unemployment growth in 2011, the most significant decrease in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years was also recorded. According to the Ministry of Finance, from January to June, the direct foreign investment of $630,697 was reached, which represents an 87.74% decrease of $5,143,312 for the same period over the previous year.
On the other hand, the State government's Ministry of Economic Development has invested more than 17,280 million dollars a year. These investments focused primarily on services businesses.
Dluh
In relation to the economic decline scenario, the government requested the State Congress in June to accept a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas with a view to restoring the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2600 million pesos.
Response
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdès showed that there was no government leadership capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Coalition of the Transforming Industry, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of coordination between individual sectors, including the government of the State itself.
"The economic development in Sinaloa has been really unscathed during this year. We must work hard to get back to the land we lost in the year. In 2012, we must double our efforts, lack of harmonisation of efforts by all of us and, in particular, proper and synchronous functioning of this new government. We hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Less economic growth
Loredo López pointed out that events like hate at the beginning of the year had stopped the state economy and undermined its development and growth.
"The poor economic movement was caused by a series of events, other than hate. One of the main consequences was the slowing down of the economy, which was quickly forgotten, so that it could regain the dynamics that would enable it to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we looked deep under the expected forecasts," he said.
Re-definition of the consignment
According to Teodora Salazara Uriarte, President of the Labour Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state should be affected by more dynamic productive activities.
"We are generally aware that it is working, and we think that a long-term plan should be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the State should be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential for material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The message that is before us
President Coopermex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better govern government efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government is trying to achieve good results in various areas, in the field of economic development has come to some progress, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress as regards the governance of public policy.
"There are individuals who can claim that the government is trying to be generous. I can say that it is here to see the work done and I think that the government is aware that there is a lot of work still ahead of us," he said.
Reimbursed for 8 kg marihuany
The population of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed him that the accused dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for criminal acts of health threats, in particular for the arrest of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army components on 7 June 2010 on arrival at the Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th station in the fourth El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer went into the supplyer's pick up white color. In the car, he had a black bag in the police and on the 7th side of a small boat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man remained available to the Judge of the second division and the management remains internal within the Centre for the realization of the legal consequences of criminal acts.
Debts of contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitats, the Protection of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face dangers that they will not be reached at the end or that they will have a lot of delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development pointed out that if the construction work has been completed so far, it is now dangerous that the government will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos on three programmes.
He pointed out that total investment in these three programmes is about 50 million pesos. The state represents 25%.
"They're supposed to ensure about 12 million and although the year they're coming to the end, we've got nothing. And even though we've already got a share in June," he said. "In order not to waste time, we've started and continue very careful, but we don't have the money."
He pointed out that in the last year of Jesus Aguilara Padilla’s administration, the state did not meet the appropriate supply, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, it had to ask for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million, which had not been given to them by the government.
"We have had a difficult situation already in the past six hundred years because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get the means to cover what was not done," he explained.
Despite the fact that there was a presence by the State representatives concerning the supply of these resources, he indicated that the request for Armando Villarreal was sent to the secretaries for administrative and financial reasons to verify the management and the corresponding percentage was first reached.
"We were supposed to provide 12 million and although the year is nearing the end, we haven't even got a dog yet."
The court approves "end of analog release" in Mexico in 2015
One of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years is the recovery of analogue signals.
The Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional appeal submitted by the Senate and the Ambassador in a motion against the presidential decree to speed up the so-called "analogous signals" and to implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He noted that there were no need for eight votes to be paid.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his power when he issued a decree stating the individual steps that would lead to the transition to underground digital television.
As a result, the application submitted by the Senate was dismissed and because the qualified majority of eight votes were not reached in order to be able to express the constitutionality or non-responsibility of the delegated act so remaining in force.
The motion for a resolution drawn up by the Ministry of Telecommunications, Mr Sánchez Cordero, provides an opportunity to declare a decree as constitutional, because regulation of all questions relating to radio and television is a matter which, according to the law, is guaranteed by the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Coffetel). This leads to a violation of the principles of the hierarchical equipment and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Senate have supported the constitutional struggle in their efforts to fight corruption. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and stopped applying the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitalization.
The Council of Ministers also decided to reject the application submitted by the honourable Member, without joining the debate on the proposal, which is also the case for Prime Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his statement, the Prime Minister stated that he did not disagree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that federal enforcement cannot be structured through the general standards of action to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that, even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas as a telecommunications sector is a federal executive who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The reward of analog signals is one of the biggest changes in the world in recent years. It corresponds to better use of a radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It is thought that the removal of the change would mean removing the benefit from digitalization, which calls for a decision on public interest. Digitalization has not only a technical dimension, but also "achieving economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these questions "requires operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of state economic direction, including the whole range of competences entrusted by the Constitution to the government of the State".
He pointed out that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, although highly specialized technical bodies have been available.
He noted that it was not possible for the Government to issue an independent decree, which, to a certain extent included in the scope of the Congress's jurisdiction, to introduce the administrative area of compliance with the laws of the legislative powers prepared.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections is 27 per cent.
The possibility of counting "vote vote" appeared in the annual elections in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the Pre-Prep Programme, the difference between the first and second place in the elections of the governor was 27 per cent, and 879 votes were not yet started in all of the 6074 electoral circles.
In this regard, the President-General of the Voleb Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ánges Länderal Zaragoza, recalled that a number of measures were adopted by the electoral authority on 9 November, which should harmonise local standards with federal voluntary reform.
As will be noted, Michoacán officially did not approve his political constitution nor his National Voluntary Code or the Law on Voluntary Justice. The Congress also approved reforms shortly before it had to comply with the legal deadlines for their entry into force in this voluntary period, and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel reminded them of their publication in a fixed period of time in the Law of the Official Secretary of State, with some objections to him.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the vote of the Head of State in the matter of constitutional reform as "unpaid and illegal", because it does not have the right to "not accept or oppose it".
On the question of the possibility of counting "vote" María de los Ánges Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures, the IEM General Council will be able to carry out a partial and complete calculation of the local electoral authority.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more volleyballs will be possible under the following conditions: voluntary results do not agree; there is no rule on counting the votes and counting in the relevant paragraph or there is no president available; or if there has been a mistake and a apparent deterioration of the voting results.
In addition, the full counting of votes in all polls will be possible if there is an indication that there is a difference between the potential winning election and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; always when the application of the representative of the party and/or coalition proposed in the second place at the beginning of the meeting is expressed.
The full counting of votes will also be possible if, after proper counting, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate at the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and always when there is an express request by the political party, whose candidate has ended in the second place.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP there is a difference between the first and second places of 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His last wish.
His people will be scattered in the forest of Zapalinam, confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés was transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During the afternoons, the celebration ceremony and the atmosphere were held.
According to the family, it was the last call for his village to be split up in the forest of Zapalinam.
After having gained the highest honour with the others who had died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila to the Gulf of Mexico Air Force. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, he reached the capital, Nazario Ortiz Garza, where his family and friends also arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., a resolution was made at the Technology Institute in Saltillo, which organized its former assistants from the technological secondary school and members of the American football team, whom Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of preparation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his invitation was that his village be split up in the Zapalinim mountains. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
According to her, the nurse made every request, he was at the top of his life, "he was a strange man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother who lived for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and attended the Collegio del Aire airport in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he even drove a truck, yet he always went after his dream to become a pilot.
His son, Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio, recalls to him as a very good man, "he recently came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Marth Sahaccoon to Saltillo."
A young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zappan for the sake of his uncle, so he was convinced that he died in the worst of his life: flying.
Did you give him the last kiss?
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, a deputy of the Mexican air forces, we agreed with all the letters that came to him by Governor Jorge Torres López, a citizen and government of the state, a Mexican army through six military zones, the sole Mexican air force, the leader and students of the technology school in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he graduated as a student, as well as in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the days following the fall of the governor who ruled. He was also a secret officer of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of the state.
At 18:05 the rest of the Saltilles' cousin Bacio Cortés (full) arrived to be delivered through the funeral service by the Mexican air force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez on a transit where his family met, his daughter Amanda and his wife, Cristina, mother, relatives and other neighbors, students and teachers.
Three dead bodies were found on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the appointment of the military, the representatives presented to the media 11 persons detained in this area for criminal acts associated with organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and heads were found on the abandoned vessel of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
There were 1.5 km of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places found out that the chat with the beach-coffee plate had time to open the door.
When they looked inside, from about three meters away, they saw three people dead, so they immediately warned the authorities.
One person had a sports trick of yellow colors and dark brown pants and had no shoes. According to him, the man was also in a sports trick with white flowers.
A few meters away, the body was found next to another person dressed in a red sports triangle and blue fur coat.
All three lay face to face on the ground.
According to data obtained on sites, all three persons were probably killed elsewhere because they were not found.
On the chat table, links were found addressed to one group of organised crime, as well as a number of steps along the streets, as well as on the posts.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained.
The National Defence Secretariat represented 11 persons, including young people, who were members of a criminal group, particularly in the Cadereyta area, who were involved in kidnapping, murder, prosecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published in the first trial on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one detained person was released.
Three property and mobile phones were secured and confirmed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, at 6 a.m., the military personnel were on the scene in the area of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta when he saw a car without a SPZ and two persons in it.
After the car stopped, they went through a search and found a gun, a gun and 18 guns.
On 13 November, on the basis of these statements, one of the complexes in the La Frauda area was detained about 14 hours ago. When he was watching soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burial in the cities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed in the middle
The appointed president of the government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face a crisis that will bring this country to an end in economic disasters.
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face a crisis that will affect the country's economic disaster and put it at risk throughout the eurozone.
The Presidential Chamber delivered a report stating that Monti, named Sunday, will meet with President Giorg Napolitano in the middle to confirm that he can create the government.
It is expected that the government will be represented by a combined majority of technology, although it is not yet clear when the new government is empowered.
Monti announced that he would present the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to establish a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti didn't explicitly say he'd be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments meant that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well-known," he added.
Monti has completed the process of setting up a government in less than three days, and in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has led to an unsustainable level of debt.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Montim has to accept a strong package of opposition measures required by European leaders, and it will only be possible to restore the confidence gained by Italy.
In Montiho there has been a great pressure to speed up. Due to the instability of the markets, the levels of the Italian debt of BTP with a 10-percent limit of 7 per cent, the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcagglia, president of the Italian Employment Organisation of Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti, "We said we are very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this armed situation.
Monti's hope for success is clearly reinforced with the support from PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis has been brought to a halt on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts have been countered with good results," said journalist Angelina Alfano, the secret of the media.
PDL support, the largest Italian party, is important because up to this point, the entire number of its members have been opposed to the government with the technological majority that forms Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Montenegrin government must have strong support for Parliament so that it can pursue non-popular successful reforms.
Any interruption or delay in that effort could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial market.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has added pressure and warns that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started in the afternoon meeting with political parties, committees and business groups, youth organisations and women.
The meeting's about to end in the afternoon at night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitan, which enabled him to respond to the crisis very quickly.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it was already evident that Berlusconi was making a commission, the levels of Italian debt went back to the critical border and responded to such uncertainty as to whether the new president of the government was failing to succeed.
To save Italy, whose public debt is moving up to EUR 1.8 billion, would be beyond the scope of the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti stated that his government should remain in power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecast that the politicians only give him time to carry out reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti pointed out that he would like to introduce policies into his office, but many parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to produce Italy from the country's infancy, which has gained from the financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that mutual distrust and non-discrimination among parties are complex attempts to engage in government and political personality.
Spain’s participation in international sports more frequently than in Costa Rica
Of the 22 Spanish footballists, ten go beyond the boundary of 50 international sports.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 authorized players reached the number of 50 games.
The contrast on the side of Costa Rica, if we compare 22 players to the two countries that met on a friendly tour today at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the masters of the world and Europe, the number one month's FIFA rating, have a wide range of cross-border ratings of Class A, Costa Rica has only Michael Umman's version, who played 50 international games as the only one.
This number reached last Friday on the battle against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spain's photobalists who play in the Education of the Stars and in the strong English first leagues are active in the league campaigns and domestic fires and high-level attacks in the framework of European champions such as the Championships League.
We must also add experiences from the National Spanish team in complex extracting gears to the European and global champions.
In contrast, Costa Rican players have very limited opportunities for foreign sports in the area. There is, for example, Concaf, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign auctions from the Spanish representative has on his account the banker Iker Casillas, who spent the last Saturday before England (play 0-1 in London) on the former banker Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international auctions.
Casillas is also against Kostarica today and will receive a new record for Spain - 127 international flights.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 games on his account.
Casillas and Xavi have even been officially declared UEFA with other Spanish players who have a number of games in their account. Among them, Zubizarreta has already been mentioned with 126 and the middle opponent Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The train also approached Carles Puyol with 97 tapes.
The following are Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa a Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Umana are moving left wing of Junior Díaz with 48 passports and the branchman Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Only 5 crossed the limit of 30 steps: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least the number of games.
With less than 30 seats in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santiago Santiago Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 seats are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't go any further than 20.
While Nach Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 years of age and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the coastal side, there are the greatest features of Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintetto included the country in its tour, on the occasion of the twenty years of existence
"Cesta on Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive conversation for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group was prepared next week to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself ensures that they have the opportunity to play on Costa Rica is a full dream for them.
That's what the bassist and the founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent in the tournament for the twenty-year term of existence and will be the only resident in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day comes from 19:30 at the National Stadium with the Angelic Group The X and the national singers from Las Robertas.
This is an indication of the conversation you will find on the La Nación website.
It's a full dream for your Costa Rican fan. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are enjoying?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we've been quite a bit of a bit of a little bit of experience and experience.
It's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy that we can bring you our song.
I wonder, because there's a group of people who worship here, fans live these days very intensively.
What do you say to your most mean audiences?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
We spent almost 21 years in Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and I'm sorry that we had to wait so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that make you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've predicted in the last 21 years have emerged in the horizon for a few weeks.
We presented a few great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we've arrived in the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We're actually very happy with this concert.
We love this country, we love serfs, we like jungles. For two activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Kostarika and her hair suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going to surf on Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, these are the best surfing places, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
When we look at your tournaments, you've prepared a huge show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan on your presentation in Costa Rica?
Because we've never played here, we don't have any restrictions on what we can't do.
We'll try to imagine the best show with the various collections. We'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and present our fans with a good and varied repertoire.
You're never packing a repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 collections and everyone likes other collections, so it's hard to choose which songs we're going to play every night.
When we have two three songs that we haven't played in the repertoire for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we loved each other so much and that we may have forgotten.
So the show's more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's even more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic dramas.
When you look back, it's hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, it is.
First of all, I think that none of us could imagine we would be in one big annual group and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we were given, and we realize that we can still play together.
We love each other and we love to make music.
We're lucky we can look at the places we've always been looking for.
We couldn't get better.
What did it mean for you that you were a significant part of the noise of the grunt?
We always felt that we could be part of this group where they are represented by themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice and Chains are our friends.
It's amazing, when the knife comes out of a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, the time will appear in the city of the group, but it is much less common to take from one city five to ten groups.
We're on this game and we feel we can be part of the Seattle team.
Sometimes we're playing with someone else.
Last year we were at Alice and Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour, we were happy that they were all our friends and we felt that we could be part of the wedding that took place in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay at work and have the same members over the years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which is already a time much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think that first we all have the happiness that we're still in this world, and secondly our role plays the fact that we're still interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this we have been able to open up the musical paths that allow each of us to have sufficient freedom for our own experiment.
We trust each other, we respect each other's songs, and I don't think that could be better.
Your relationship with the word was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find the equation?
As we grew up, it was gradually as much easier to find a balance.
We're trying not to drive too far on tour, because it's very easy to fall into this trap of taxes and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come because of music, remember that you have to respect music and what you have given it, you must not let yourself be ruined by the fact that you're famous, rock stars.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and at first it was something big.
As a hat we had three years and never released any album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it lasted so long. Most importantly, even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us. When I hear a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible I was with him. It was always the joy of working with him, laughing, playing music or football and many more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her very much.
The National Chapter of Las Robertas will be trusted to start the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as a prep?
Yes, the producer sent us a video with a few suggestions and this group loved us the most. That's why we know what Las Robertas offers life and they have to be very fun.
Why do you always change the word Yellow Ledbetter?
That's a question about Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's adding the first thing he's gonna hit him.
Who's affecting you as a bass?
A lot of people.
As my first attack on Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so much I could talk about the bass that I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunt, though he's not in fashion?
I think we've always felt easier to get separated from the words of the grunt.
When it comes to grunts, I'm going to introduce myself to groups that I've mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who have played at the same time, and if even today such music is expensive, it's something great because it's the song that stands for listening to it and groups like Mudhoney today are playing better than ever before.
At first, your music was easy to express and now it's more positive.
What's the point of this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that in the new album there are some savings that are easier to calculate, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very boring, although they can be described as positive.
Two times, when Ed played me, I cried, and they're really dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or friends, these things start to affect your art and music and these two songs just represent me.
I also think you can be a happy person, and still make a quiet music.
Peru:
Fujimori has been re-suspended on medical tests.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital, where he was tested for a massive loss that he suffered in the area of the lower end, informing his healing doctor.
72-year-old Fujimori, who repeats a 25-year sentence of liberty for violating human rights saved by his government (1990-2000), suffers from a number of disabilities, including cancers of the tongue, which has been four times over and now have doctors under control.
Ambassador Alejandro Agunga, who is his personal doctor, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Nonplastic Diseases for three days, where they should find out why he is suffering and why he is losing his strength in low-ends.
Agunga said that according to his view, Fujimori could have mercy for humanitarian reasons, although the former president himself did not accept mercy because he felt innocent.
Four times he was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue, he weighed 18 pounds [18 kg], and other problems such as severe erystyd gastritis, slytic acid, kidney stones, high pressure, and bone problems were added to these problems, and he mentioned a doctor.
Fujimori has been prosecuted since September 2007 by the National Police Office.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons who killed the murder of an army officer who had been illegally involved in the first years of his government.
Music on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political commitment
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, made up of several ministers and businessmen, is starting in the evening visit to Mexico. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to tackle the political issues of the region.
Music is in the middle with its Mexican counterpart, Phillip Calderón. It is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging visit to the political, trade and representatives of the Georgian community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Georgian Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Georgian Presidency announced on its websites.
According to local media, Mujica will try to take Calderón to support Uruguay in the conflict with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy organized the South American country on the list of tax levels at G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In its report, Sarkozy threatened that the countries that will continue to remain in the position of the tax authorities will be excluded from the international community, which has led to a negative opinion from Uruguay and consultation with the majority in this European country.
Mexico is president of G20 from November. G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries of the world. With the mention of Latin American countries, this year, the Agreement on the Exchange of Information to Prevent double taxation has been concluded.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has urged the establishment of a fiscal exchange agreement with a view to obtaining from the "black list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on which countries have not met all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From the business perspective of Mexico and Uruguay, since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been concluded, which has led to the strengthening of the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Vousated installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has not fought for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evils of Bowser, yet he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of girls with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month into all the world's trades has been created since the beginning to use all the features offered by Nintendo 3DS transfer console, which enables you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a post that must say how stereoscopoes should function without glasses," said a worker specializing in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of video games in Madrid.
Álvarez pointed out that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game Nintendo created especially for this knife", because by this time successful photos such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zarda: Ocarine of time 3D" have already been adapted to existing titles.
Speaking Nintendo indicated that in addition to the 3D video, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and floating party.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less handy users.
Once you're over this level, you can get into the "second car" on the levels that are now cheaper.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or such that has only an impact on the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome the most diverse challenges and "not to listen to optical bells".
This new super Maria's 3D approach is also expected with a return to the transfer console that has not been reached since 2005.
In this video, Nintendo is playing in the notes of those who follow the story and repeat the successful formulas from the past. It is the fact that the installation of the website of a man will have to go through dangerously changed platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in motions, in the environment, in moves, and among enemies, it also appears "food" to Luigi.
Colom approved Portilla's release to the United States
On Tuesday, President Álvaro Colom announced that he had taken steps to address the issue of former President Alfonso Portilla, who had to be responsible in the United States for savings of $70 million.
This is the final process that was aimed at Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country, which requires Portilla to be issued so that it can be tried.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and that he remembered that the court had already ordered the execution.
He made sure that during his term of office, he was "no longer" in court decisions and allowed all the publications that he had received on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and serious health injuries and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The column's step is the step of execution after all judicial and constitutional proceedings have been taken to initiate the process against the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued following the settlement of his legal situation in Guatemala and the enforcement of human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was monitored innocently in the amount of 120 million to the Ministry of Defence during his presidency, and this process was preceded by the release, but the Public Ministry refused and returned to the game.
Trinijo helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization has made it possible to help children without education not to be read at the top of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of existence of Trinij's social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people who threatened social exclusion received help.
This should take into account the long-term proportion of jobs acquired for this social group.
The previous year also served to provide a balance sheet under the Christmas Act, which was played in the former manufacturing spaces of Fabra and Coats and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Triniov's organisation emerged in the fourth Trinitat Vela in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug dependence or in situations where they might fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organisations and institutions who have worked with associations for the past 25 years have participated in the meeting in San Andre.
The wide-ranging political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unique nature of the work that Trini's work is being done.
Along with President Generalitat, Artur Masem, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujolem, participated in the wedding act with former socialist educators, Ernest Margall, and former replacement of the old and contemporary ecological-socialist worker Richard Goma.
Fabra and Coats have also been provided with the same counsel for the social welfare and family, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and the director-general of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trini's experience was a very difficult time and that today's time also causes a number of obstacles, but he added that the work that the association brought to today is "a good basis".
The President pointed out to Trini, for example, how it is possible to fight against unbridled circumstances and how to provide comfort to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, nothing new," he said.
There came to be a house in which giant dinners were arranged
Firefighters rented 11 of 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 buyers left home yesterday morning without having to take a break
It all points to the fact that the night measure, which survived by neighbors of the 51st of the Balmes street, is finally over.
Twelve people left the building that they had illegally occupied and where they had organized giant parties that were built by neighbors. They left the building under court regulations and would not have to keep the police.
After the completion of the operation, a lock on the doors was exchanged to prevent the recovery of the situation.
"From now on, the entry will be monitored," the manager said.
The buyers who took 11 of the 13 houses in the building - the remains have been destroyed - brought all electrical and partially and water equipment, besides reducing the walls and leaving behind the waste of all kinds, especially those of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three rooms, there were huge parties that lasted for up to two days and hired other tenants.
According to the building, it's a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that during the period when the building was occupied, the markets closed by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the construction contractors made it a bit competitive because they sold 3 euros of cigarettes on the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of neighbors about the noise. However, the problems did not cause the visitors of the discotheques, but the residents of the house, and in particular those who participated here in the evenings, whose frequency and intensity in the last few weeks grew, according to the dissolved inhabitants of the environment.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and he'd let her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that over the last few weeks, she had more problems with neighbors than she did at the time.
The president of the city group of PP on the workshop, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week that "the buildings should be immediately excavated and end up with the problems of the civil relations that the neighbours suffer and the neglect of the area".
The President explained that only one income was withheld before the year, but in recent months the employers were able to get to all the houses and almost all the houses, and one of them even came to steal.
In this direction, he added that "it must be done with impunity and be consistent if it comes to the effects of civil liability which has come into the future".
Last night, the city police also destroyed the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 minutes, the police arrived at the building at 35 in the Mont-ral street after inviting her neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were arrested right away.
Park or mountain?
Architects met on the occasion of issuing orders which were not more than the police in respect of honorary persons
The urban selection board for 16 branches will reopen the debate on the role of the Colserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, during the largest explosion, the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-containment issued several pamflights in support of Collserola Park.
The plane has defined the mountain as a large parking lot in Barcelona.
More than that, he was filled with a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the top boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan Metro is just one of the small ones that do not focus on the north axis - they are, but above (the mountain) - down (the sea).
Collseroly's qualifications as a natural park are going this way.
The reference was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildflowers instead of the Yogi bear.
This was the position until Saturday, when the council announced a competition of 16 competitions with the same number of entry branches to Collseroly.
Of course, the defense is playing a lot better in the thinking of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put a gun in the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or hill?
During the competition, both in terms of the clean organization and the reflection of the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already the same theme as if two members of this old case were hand-made in the interview.
And that's what he called one of the most remarkable agreements between the three Barcelona architects and the pre-eminent university professors.
Miguel Rollan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: The election board has its resignation.
According to Rolandan, after the question of the sea side, "there is a need to discuss "the mountain side", so the discovery of Ildefense Cerda on green apples has not been brought to an end.
"We must depart from the principle that the most bright Barcelona park is the beach.
Except for their great availability.
Collserola is more complex," declared an architect, whose name is "protection to Collserola" in itself is "lexicological post": we must not represent them "as entrances to the park, but rather as an extension of the area where it is possible to move".
The module, like Rollan and Bayon with experience from urbanism, qualifies the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" based on "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "insecures which today represents the project of a public place" after an 80-year-old experience, which was in the area of the Forum "his well-being of music".
The first concern is the unique limitation of borders where it should be established.
"Something means doing another step," it's basically taking a step further.
"It is necessary to remember new urban and planning tools, because the current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause real confusion."
If we focus more on the question, Modol is thought to be able to "consider for the park", but the Barcelona section is nowhere, for the sake of pure topographics.
The module also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserola, who "can't end up in a garbage dump", even though the fact that the factory offers his grave that he's been involved in the project from "first time".
And it is also understood that the proximity of mountains and cities is a kind of failure that allows architects to engage in debate, but "disquiets" that it should be just this technical profile that leads to multidisciplinary teams ("this is all about skill"), which should be created: "Architecturals should be only tools".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex because, in the context of the selection process, there is a lack of a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 electoral arrangements that all people in the mountains - the sea, but there is no sub-study that would look at and understand it as a whole."
This allows at least him to sign up to all 16 electoral procedures.
Otherwise the same project of one branch can be based on the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring branch.
According to him, the council should ensure that the dog located directly above Ronda de Dalt should be protected throughout the entire area of equipment, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino Prominent for Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legally executed Cadino Red granted the mercy of the elder of Monterey in the process in which he was made to express himself.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal was sentenced to 72 days in prison and will now be released after he received the mercy of his former brother, Cassio Red, before the Second Criminal Court in a court that ruled the case of expulsion.
After an interview with Casino Royale owner Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask for an economic quota to enable a factory in Monterrey to operate illegally in a dry house.
Following a public complaint, the State prosecutor began the criminal proceedings of the Panistic elderly brother. On 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agency of the Ministry of Public Affairs, number 3 for property offences was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the State capital.
At this point, the following 49 days after the second regulation was introduced, and the public ministry agent was able to participate or organise a crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to Cadereyta's criminal court to suspect that Casina Red's owner was a half a million pesos. However, he remained in prison for only a few hours with a very serious charge because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city halls in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was given a warrant issued by the Secretaries of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who announced that there was a collection of evidence to enable Jonah’s wine to be shown. For example, among the evidence is payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives, unless the operation is possible.
This afternoon, the legal superintendent of Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the older brother of the region. On that basis, he will be able to return soon.
During a legal meeting with the representatives of the Ministry of Public Affairs assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias asked García Gomez whether the damages had been made and who of the partners had decided to grant mercy.
According to official letter 197/2011, the legal mercy of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the process against him, it will not be possible to impose any hardship. It is also possible to ask for compensation for damage or punishment.
After a violation of the law, around 15:50 the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The secret officer of the court, Jorge Yanez, was sent to the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and that his case had been sent to the archives.
He also announced that the judge had issued an immediate regulation on his release.
The secretor Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the aviation accident that left the secret officer, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The communication and transport secretariat (SCT) informed that the results of an accident investigation by the secretaries of the government of Francisco Blake Mora and the other seven persons indicate that the returning officer was directly on the ground with full force without the pilot being able to try to reach the required landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, a secretary for Communication and Transport, indicated that prior to the start of the flight, the pilot found that climate conditions allow years.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit has come several times to contact the terraen, the wings have flown into the wind of trees 25 meters from where the unit has lost the body."
He also informed that the unit had been appointed for 19 persons and therefore fulfilled all requirements for the transfer of staff.
In addition, he indicated that, on the basis of an investigation carried out in the area of the dispute, no shares were found in the country.
"When looking, it was found that the parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft appeared on the ground as a cell.
"The dealer was appointed for 19 persons, met all requirements for the transport of persons.
The teren represents each of the seven to three degrees.
The secretor found that it is most important at the moment to obtain the fastest results. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, the director-general of the airport and auxiliary services, announced that at the moment of the strike, the vice president of the General's state was moving at the speed of flight and the accident occurred on the hill.
"This information supports the assumption that in the event of an accident, there was an ordinary flight operation," he said.
At the press conference of the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome mentioned six basic research points:
Year of vision:
In accordance with flight standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, meaning that the crew must be seen on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at the start, in accordance with this aircraft, the route to the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico, has been marked by low altitudes.
Allowed tracks:
It is likely that for the sake of reason, the dark crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility until the port of Cuernavaca.
The location of the attack.
The statement authority and the last record of the radar receiver are agreed, it is likely that the statement did not result in loss of control or failure of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of remaining aircraft on restricted territory:
The information we have at present allows us to assume that there has been an equal trajectory and from the side.
The scope of the question of the rest of the aircraft indicates that at the time of the strike, the cell phone was a cellist.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence has been found at the site of the accident that would prove that the explosion or fire has occurred.
The final results of the investigation show that it could have reached several contacts with the firm.
During the field operations, the remaining aircraft were found at altitudes up to 9200 degrees above sea level, the ground is considered to be above sea level from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the ruins that were likely to fall under the mentioned trail.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the vendor could have access to the country in several places.
After a sharp turn around the accident, on a land that is more extensive than the land of extinction, there were no remnants of the revolver, which reinforces the view that the strike occurred when the revolver was still Celestial.
The Mexican health insurance institution has started a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research with the aim of identifying the gene responsible for the obstetrics of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research with the aim of detecting a gene that causes obese in children and young people. A study called "Genetic obese in children and adolescents" will be able to obtain results relating to obesity.
In a report by the Scientific Research Unit in the Biochemistry of the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team was composed of doctors, nurses, life professionals and social workers.
This team shall provide support for experts and postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Research and Advanced Studies Centre (Cinvesta) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
A wide audience with or without permission can also join the research. People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will carry out every 8 hours of youth tests.
He pointed out that the research began in the Sports Centre Cuauhtémoc (Mexico) and since 8 October this activity is also carried out at the Sports Centre Nezahualcóyolt (Mexico State East).
Once data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sports Centre Independencia (just south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to identify the ingredients and the meaning of genetics, as regards the development of obesity, and to expose the risk factors of Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the goal of gathering data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 was to agree and, under the supervision of parents, to apply specific life questions.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and family analysis of genetic defects with a view to avoiding risk factors that could cause diabetes or kidney failure.
He stressed that each Saturday all participants are conducting anthropometric measurements (drugs, heights, strokes), blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genes are identified.
Cruz López indicated that this research reflects the concern of doctors over alarming growth in children.
"The health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had an increase of 77% and 47% for girls. The dramatic increase also occurred in the case of obesity," an IMSS expert said.
He pointed out that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the belief that the population of the country is different from the rest of the population of its genetic history.
He reported that average Mexicoan has 65% Indian-American genetics, 30% Europeans and 5% Africans. This fact is reflected in genes that are responsible for the incidence of diabetes and obesity.
He explained that, in general, obese genetics are often explained as a failure to burn the excess energy that we consume (calorie) and that is in the form of fluids.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will be able to fully assess the status of children, which will determine whether they show some signs of overcrowding or obsessiveness.
He pointed out that even the presence of a dark color (acantos) on the church and the premise indicates the likelihood that this individual will suffer from metabolic problems and premature conditions.
Information is still reliable, doctors give it to parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that they need to make in order to avoid illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause stress, anxiety and other chronic illness: seven life-threatening lack of daily physical activities, full-time TV and use of transport facilities instead of short distance.
It also causes great caloric intake, which is greater consumption of dried beverages, hydrohydrates (majales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fats and proteins and genetic fat, which is the subject of this research.
No requests will be made in Asfalta with UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and creates a mixture of better function, depending on climate conditions and temperature
If it had been correctly recovered, it should not have corrected almost 200 thousand claims after each period of duties in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical School (FQ), who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphaltaltic claims were adequate, it would have come to a significant limit, or even possible to remove them completely.
In his presentation, the technological cause of damages that occurred during the International Year of Chemistry announced that a laboratory under its control develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture of similar characteristics such as as as Asphalt, but also greater mechanical isolation, both in low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera is thought to be able to use this type of modified asphalt in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. It would improve the functionality and reduce the creation of waste.
He explained that asphalt, the most difficult part of the rose, is the collection of molecules of hydrocarbons, the molecule with a large molecular mass called asphaltins, and the other with a low molecular mass called maltens.
The high-quality asphalt character is the result of a high temperature, around 180 degrees, acting as a liquid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost stable, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to slow down, added.
This means that the absence of asphalt in the streets is not unique, but changes are made during the day according to the weather and temperature, the expert on chemical engineering warned.
A scientist from the chemical college observed that most streets in Ciudad de Mexico are covered by a flexible debt that creates six types of materials, three of which are the last of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the most outstanding species is the asphalt paste, made of small stones in the asphalt and then crushed.
He pointed out that every stone that makes the tape is to burn with asphalt.
When driving a car or when making a pressure, it is possible that the force is well distributed.
If it were about modified asphalt, it would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer is thought to be.
He added that the last species called a beach, made of fine stone, will be placed on the asphalt.
Given that this type will come into contact with the vehicle tyres, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt input and must ensure the treading of the vehicles.
Given that a large amount of debt will be incurred as part of the loan, the ceiling must be sufficient and attention must be paid to the material from which it is prepared.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that must be remembered. Water has a major impact on the function of asphalt inputs.
Once the ground is wet, the water spreads inside and is difficult to get out, it makes it easier for all kinds of damage and the resulting damage.
He explained that during the creation of the explosions, the film of the platform was first destroyed and then the asphalt was damaged. But it does not come at once, but it is a voluntary process that should be stopped by the first signs of the appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the construction of the tyres, and therefore the pressure of each type of tyre must be responsible for the vehicle's load and must be assured that this load is not too high.
Rafael Herrera warned that when it comes to asphalt, we are still waiting for a lot of work and research to begin. For example, asphalt emulsions that are already available in other countries are available on the market and allow us to easily fix requests without using high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidate to become Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to achieve Miss Columbia's rank.
That's how Valle gets the 14th title of the first multiple.
Valle del Cauca was not enough again at Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to calm down because she looked at the floor of the victory, got a sharp edge and a sharp, on the basis of which she became the first majority of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, where she won and won Miss Atlantico, the mentioned department won the 14th prize. Melina joined with the representatives of Valle del Cauca, who had won the winning race, but were later declared the first majority. Among them were Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rosa Maria Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), María Pinedo (1990), Danielo (1990) and Daniela Isabelro (Galdo), Danielo (Boura).
It's a question that's a lot of fun.
As a result, the defeat of the great favor that has shown in all previous streets that it is about to become a new Miss Columbia, and not to become the Royal Police and the most noble form of Joel de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who have subsequently taken the title Miss Columbia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only the First Multiple is the fact that she did not testify to her answer to the question: "What book did you most like and why?" which Martin Murillo Gómez from the Liamos literary edition.
The applicant replied to the question:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "Little prince", a very deep book.
It's a book that is part of the worldwide literature we should all know. And today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. It's a wonderful book called El Ardor de la sangre.
However, this response did not like the "culturalization" term, and unfortunately the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned.
After the end of the celebration, Melina announced that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise, what it has to happen will happen.
And you people, read, if you can, a little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheticals is that Valle destroyed the favored position.
The Bogotic journalist pointed out that from the beginning, the candidate was the most popular, the most popular, and the one who brought all the previous prices (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artists' dress and the Royal Mother), raised the involvement of other enthusiasts, the queen who then burned at the scene.
It was clear during the first presentation of the blue on the Hilton beach and during two pre-conventional reviews.
Even though she was on both sides, it was known that she lacked the strength and memory of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osoriio, a journalist of the Canal RCN's "Home" program, is thought to have Melenda obtained the title of the first multimesses to confirm that the candidate who receives the most titles during the contest does not finally go out with the Queen's crown".
In addition, Valle had become more indifferent to the media in recent days and had not paid for it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the national competition for beauty.
On the other hand, two days before the election, the international member of the Lucy Doughty report indicated that they are looking for a woman who will know the social needs of her country.
"In the competition of Miss Colombia the beauty itself is not enough, there is a need to see something more than the physical beauty. It is important to focus on the social feeling. It is important that candidates remain before they enter the competition, they are involved in such projects," she explained.
It is also reflected in the fact that Valle's candidate lost points because of his own lack of background and fibrosis, which was on the back. But this is entirely contrary to the value of the report that she chose the "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, proper survival and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina had no better body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis on the roof, which I think was not too well known, were picked up by her until the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos magazine is believed to have made a mistake when she made several surgical advances.
"Cyrrhythmias are all right, but they didn't tell them in Valle.
The body was never her strong side, and here you chose your tax."
Because of this evaluation, which was first made by the National Collection of Beauty, after a look at the flowers, came to the stern warning that it was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the comfort that Raymond Meline added that she did not finally make the highest rank.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that today Melina has begun her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that allows her to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named by the National Competition alone.
Nevertheless, it is recorded as one of the kings who, despite the winning success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest rank.
This was the work of the Cali, who identified Alfonso Cana's dead.
Cali's fingerprints team went into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana.
The work of these officers is key.
On November 4th of last year, a press expert from CTI in Cali entered the history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader of Farc: "Alphonse Cana", which is by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven experts on fingerprints working on the CTI department, this week was a row at Eliazar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a workshop in Chocó, where he had to spend more than five days selling garbage in order to get to a place where the dead had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the main city of Valle and, after completing the appropriate courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. This knowledge is based on a study of skin training, hand and leg.
In a week when an operation against Alphonse Canov was carried out, Eliazar told him to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went out to Cauca in a wheelchair from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead persons and that he suspected that one of them was a man who led the oldest guerilla in the world, so he was asked to take a card from the print of Guillerma Leon Sáenze's fingers (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where she was found dead, he did not recognize her because of her physical appearance.
He had no shoes, dressed like a village in the given area, without glasses, much safer.
But the prints don't.
Along with the galton lamp, the ink and the transplanter and the light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the dead with the records of the cards.
It didn't say it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night the man from Puerto Tejada was trusted to be the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to confirm that he was truly the highest leader of Farc.
Tracking
For the documentary bishop of Siijen de Cali, the recognition that the President Juan Manuel Santos, Eliazar of Gonzalez, appeared at the press conference of operational services against "Canovi".
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscope is accurate knowledge, without the possibility of errors that can play a key role in the decision of criminal acts.
In addition to identifying the dead, these people help to investigate criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the victims.
When they are caught, a lot of dealers present false evidence or have no papers at all.
We'll get them fingerprints and find them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the event of an injury, he had to remove the bitch from the house because in this place the thief was working to remove a treasure full of spices and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for printing, but in this case we could obtain prints full of hands and identify the customers who participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints may also be confirmed or suspected in the case of murder.
Before long, a dead man with alcohol was found around him.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and that the impression on the mind was actually confirmed.
Although it is not consistently confirmed that he was a real murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of a crime.
The Committee on the Prints of the CTI explained that the prints "are produced by chemical or physical active substances".
When it appears, the transplanter or sand is used for their selection.
Then prints are sent to Asif, which is the database of dealers, or the Register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians in the present time whose data are never recorded," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as indicated in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that's going on, it's not gold, it's not everything you touch, there's still feet.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Hearts" protest in New York
The demonstrators pushed themselves to Zuccotti's place where they wanted to be.
A large part of them were waiting for the space crossing order and moved to a nearby park.
The members' hounds of the Wall Street were tried in New York's afternoon as they tried to get back to Manhattan's place from the morning. Then they tried to take another New York park.
The demonstrators pushed themselves to Zuccotti's place, where they wanted to get the court order, which allowed the "scraped" to return to the places. The second half of the corner responded to the crossing by taking the park to the north of the city, where it came to another detention.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the place, we will rely on another place and continue in a legal battle with the purpose of returning to Zuccotti, and it is like by means of a gathering, such a peaceful demonstration," said one of the speakers "Avoid Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray confirmed that the response to the "resurrection" of a camp ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached a court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent displacement of the places and allowed demonstrators to stay here.
In addition to the "excessance" they took another park located on the crossings of the Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the farm land in Trinity Church.
At least an hour later, they were able to take the place, but then the police came and arrested some manifestants, and Bray didn't know the exact number, but he indicated that he saw that the poets were also sitting with some journalists.
The organization ensures that several hundred people have sat on the ground, and the delegation of religious representatives has also come to express their support and to try to communicate with the police.
Between the town of Zuccotti, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to come right in the afternoon, and during which the law of early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the transferred protesters even distributed copies of the court order and even handed it to the officials who watched the site, which caused "some small shootings," declared Bray, who condemned the fact that some police manifestants were.
The court order prohibits the authorities from sending members of the "Occupa Wall Street" or using "laws published after the party started, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with the trade or other places they previously used".
Old Bloomberg pointed out that, in view of this court order, the city stopped opening the public area again and the protesters warned that local laws did not allow them to return to their homes and shops.
The city's highest representative personally protected the early departure of Zuccotti, an operation where 200 persons were detained and who were admitted because the demonstrators "refused the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the city to be evacuated because it became "a place where people didn't have to protest, but to break the laws and, in some cases, to approach others", because "some businesses got the worst kind of letters" and "the neighbors were afraid of the quality of their lives".
"The morning shift was clear and shows Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests in the hands of an American worker," added a spokesman who accused the old man of "not thinking of freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" also indicated that they are planning to organize "great action" on Thursday in cooperation with community and committee organizations to commemorate two months after which they are protesting.
Pamela Anderson will present Mrs. Marie on a special Christmas television show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians will appear on the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a sailor in "Baywatch", a concert in "Playboy", a wife of the annual singer Tommy Lee, and now a hero and model will be Panno Marie in a special wedding series of Canadian television.
The private television station CTV has announced today that Anderson, together with the singing of sensitive songs by Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, and will be cheering Mrs. Mary.
The CTV has shown events from a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet pornography videos, will appear with his former husband, Mötley Crée, Tommy Leem, as Miss Maria, who is presenting Jesus in the same movie.
As Josef appears on the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently became the moderator of the tournament "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheena.
Except Anderson and Peters, the special VT will reveal a Canadian song of Bublé, which was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisano Lopilato, which is close to the controversy.
Recently Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York's "Little".
Japan’s Return to Life After the Nice Landing · Global Voices
HDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and ends the period of floods that began in March
Since the summer of last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, and now comes to be affected by the nuclear earthquake, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War 2.
First, the Tokyo government calculated the material loss of $300,000,000, a morning that despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarter-year-olds, the value of HDP between the Swedish and the stock was reached in such a way that it was possible to round the page with the definitive value: HDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year begins in March 2012 - further predict the maximum rate of growth compared with the summer to the summer of 2010.
Life can be partially explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of the area of destroyed landfills and subsequent tsunamis.
The deficits increased by 1.1%, spending less than 0.9% of the ice to the coast. This is the first drop after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real threat of Japan's economy comes from a very strong impulse that requires us to use the crisis to get out of it, or to re-infrastructure it, and that is to use the lack of it to start all zeros.
In particular, Japan has developed domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This change increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
New Path
That was the case with the internal market, when the Japanese mines became one of the "saving values" for investors who escape from the debt crisis in the euro area and from the disturbing forecasts of the USA. It is a privilege, however, which is also a great burden for export companies.
The stronger the change, the more expensive products are, which is negative for the country whose economy is defined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony counted their bad results in July until September of the right course.
While the markets continue to expand the borders of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is serious.
"We need to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid rise of new ones," the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa said yesterday.
And the perspectives are not really exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has emphasized that most Member States have demonstrated clear signs of economic downturn.
The indicator that predicts world economy instability showed that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
The decrease of four decades to 100.4 points is reduced by 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even reached an average of 100. It has reached a level of 99,13 points.
Athenian again spreads insecurity
Papadimos says opposition measures will be approved, but the conservators do not sign any written commitments
With the rapid and risk-increasing Ukrainian guarantees and the uncertainty once again, Greece continues to be paid to the labyrinth, leading to the emergence of a major debt crisis in Europe.
The view is that the new transitional Greek government is giving more to Brussels than the real conviction of political forces, it is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that for structural reforms there is no alternative and that the 100-day period that he had received at his appointment will probably be shorter for their applications, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, announced that the new opposition measures did not support and filled out his demand for new elections on the expected date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos announced yesterday during a parliamentary debate, which will result in a vote on the government's trust tomorrow.
The package with 24 programmes supporting employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax fines will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase's report does not explain any doubts about his existence: "We called for the aid of the Transitional Government, but we have not agreed on anything else."
The President of the Conservatives took a little further in his statement to the EU and the IMF, which should block 8 billion which Athens urgently needs, but he also stated that he does not support and subscribe to any commitments relating to the implementation of the support measures.
The European Commission has already been resolved by the impact which caused Papadre's games with the referendum yesterday, highlighted that its requirements are inexhaustible: it does not block any aid unless the new government and representatives of the main parties sign "a written commitment without duality and what may be the first time".
Speaker for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from Trojky will return to Athens "very fast" and will meet with the new government about "what is needed for payment of the sixth part" 8 billion. But there is no definition date.
The Greek cousin's got a little bit more of what's going on.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Royal Council welcomes Spain's excellent position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a significant global level in terms of microfinance".
King Sophie reminded yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet, when it comes to this tool of cooperation, which is based on "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man."
The Queen of the World Summit in Valladolid concluded last night that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "It is particularly important to meet the goals that have to achieve a reduction in the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, and with a share of the right to poverty".
The Spanish "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsible", declared Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of Summita, which will be first and foremost, "will ensure better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are primarily defined by these loans.
"We've reached a lot" and "a lot of challenges are still ahead of us."
The summation of microchips should be not only a discussion forum but also a platform that supports "core objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal was to have 175 million poor families access these financial services by the end of 2015 and 100 million families to gain access to the right of the poverty they are currently living in.
The concept of a micropod in Spain and in other countries of the world was extended after, "which was published by scholar Muhammad Yunus on this path," the king introduced and added that it was one "of the act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this tool as "a wonderful idealist who went out on his way to fight poverty." He met with his work 15 years ago when he went to Bangladesh to get to know him directly in place with his pay policy.
Following this experience, the first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in the Solomon Islands in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "At all these meetings, I was able to see a steady development, explained the queen who, thanks to her support for this project, had been working on the title "the head of the family", which made it "the victims of the poor in Valladolid".
Queen Sofia concluded her resignation by calling on participants to engage in discussion and search for solutions and thereby allowed them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, announced that it is a "ethical imperative" that must govern all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate with developing countries only with the period of balobacco, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez is believed to represent a "serious and positive policy to remove poverty", and now more than ever before, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow for the immediate solidarity of victims.
For Spain, micropentry is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on the belief that we give the people who all others hold the door. The elderly Valladolidu, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed participants in the city who "opens its defenses of solidarity which is binding".
The CDU proposes to vote by the European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party of Angel Merkel, the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) convention in Lipsko on Monday 14 November.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the programme, but it remained on the ground, in particular in order to be comforted by the members of the government who are considering today's government policy against the Greeks and possibly against Italy tomorrow.
The proposal concerning the leadership of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegations were voting.
A few minutes later, the sheep came to the conclusion of the appearance of Angely Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, a very European finance minister, left room for doubt.
The main opinion of the Chancellor and the proposal can be included in the slogan: the response to the crisis is "no less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "twenty million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the office in Europe, "the time for change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also be issued to the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voluntary law "with a view to giving Europe a single face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposals adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is very unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will be able to respond quickly to this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom will stand against it and the leading CDU representatives think that we will take the same position as Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction's off.
In the same way, delegations have prevented a large majority of proposals from assessing the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's Presidency, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in the strengthening of Germany's weight.
An elderly man who managed to calm the climate within his own country, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmuta Kolla. But he did not try to get a convention of the "little" European states or of the countries that are in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Perhaps the proposal concerning Europe is one of the highlights of the importance of the French-German friendship, Angela Merkel of France did not.
We just don't know.
When she recalled that just two years ago, she had a blood battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most devastating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a doubt about working incompatibility?
Support shall be granted by the UMP and by the Government of Violence against Labour Incompatibility.
Nicolas Sarkozy will visit Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will talk on the issue of combating social obstacles and redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As a result of this abuse, which stems from the desire to take a stand in the context of increased presence, but it is not less clear from the view of the right presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on labour incompatibility.
First of all, due to budgetary support, the government will intend to introduce private sector employees on the fourth day of unemployment before they begin to receive aid in difficulty.
Clearly, without agreement, an employee who is ill would lose four days of surgery, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
The measures that threaten to cause a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the list of Les Echos, could amount to EUR 280 million.
The measures would also be implemented by the following measures of a symbolic approach: to give public employees one day an unrecorded job disability (which has no ability to sell for three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the majority of the legal parties also have the theme of the debate that is now focused on the abuses associated with labour inadequacies.
"The controls will be much broader and more: if you arrive, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned in a discussion with the RTL station provided on Sunday 13 November.
Similarly, in other cases, the effects of notification may appear to be some unintended due to the fact that there is injustice in the workplace.
These were, in fact, the subject of ongoing monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that brought their fruits.
The French are no more ill than others in Europe.
Let's start with a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse d'assurance disease (CNAM - National Health Insurance) more than EUR 237 million was paid daily.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008, their daily remuneration was EUR 11.3 billion 5% in health expenditure.
Of these amounts, 46% were related to maternal contributions and labour impacts, and 54% were affected by unemployment, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of health costs.
According to a study of the Alma Consulting group, France had an average of 14.5 working days for 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which conceals certain derogations: another survey published in 2007 on sites with job opportunities Monster.com showed that 75% of the French employees in question replied that they did not choose any working day.
Another study, carried out by non-performance insurance institutions, points out that in 2010 37.8% of unemployment was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 month to 3 months, and 11% remained longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer vulnerable to labour incompatibility.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absence (for health reasons or at all) increased in France between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
In the case of job failures, only very small part of the job is left to black.
When it comes to the dividends, these are only a small amount.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks aimed at job incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 were conducted due to short-term incompatibility of "unjusted or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematic incompatibility over 45 days, 11% of "unadjusted or unlawful" cases were calculated for 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
At the same time, 169 000 "unjusted" cases against several million employees who were unemployed.
The number that represents a lot less than the number that expresses the work on the black.
According to UMP Ambassador Dominique Tiana, the author of the Green Report on this issue, this figure would represent between EUR 9 and EUR 15 billion missing in the selection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily remuneration and therefore, in the end, more than the total turnover of the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new saved plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday 14 December, President Lucas Papadimos addressed the House of Ministers and added that a hundred days of his government will not fulfil this task.
"To restore our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new saved budget plan," the head of government announced when he held his first public hearing in the beginning of a debate on confidence in Parliament.
The payment of decisions adopted on 27 October at the euro area summit will be "the main task" of the new governments, because in the game our country has joined the euro area.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "in about 9%" of the gross domestic product by the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to refuse new countermeasures
The Head of Law, Antonis Samaras, expressed his support on Monday for the measures already approved to try to avoid the debt crisis, but warned that his party was not bound by any additional suspension measures.
"We will not raise our hands for any new action," Samaras highlighted the meeting with his delegation on his side of the New Democracy.
We have responded to the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating fraud, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economy and Economy, who warned that the IMF and the EU do not block the necessary budget of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties supporting the proposed measure, answered Antonis Samaras that his word is sufficient and that it does not fall under any external pressure.
It is necessary to legislate euthanasia and self-sustained suicide, says the Committee of Experts
According to a report from the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians have been sentenced to death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently calls for governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care and even in cancer cases.
Canada's society lives with the idea of opening up death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and decide in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society's extensive report, where six experts working in different areas, including ethics, law and medicine, were involved.
This Commission recommends that the government amend the criminal law in order to allow the assisted suicide and euthanasia, provided that such a call is necessary in a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quoted the recent independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 planets.
Perhaps Canada has moved to 10 places, the study notes that "the medicament of death in Canada has given rise to cultures in which people fear to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, they send us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And over the invitation to die at a home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average pays for Canada's entire population, while in the province of Quebec this figure is the highest of 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the authors come to the conclusions of the federal government that have already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicides do not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also taken control of all countries where these approaches are lawfully or are not considered to be a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation does cause any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides to persons who are not or are not subject to consent.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at the teleconference more than a number of cases of these arrests just in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanazia is also being carried out in Canada, where it is strictly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is strictly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downe.
Canadians are forced into euthanasia
We note that 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in the promotion of euthanasia, according to Angus Reid's survey conducted in 2010 because they believe that they can ease their suffering at the end of their life.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we send a message that the lives of the elderly or the disabled have a lower price.
In the case of persons who practice assisted suicide, 41% of the requested persons shall decide that they should not be prosecuted.
In the matter of maintaining or interrupting the patient's care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
It is also suggested in the list of recommendations to be included in criminal law that the withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for professional doctors to be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without fear of criminal activity.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently calls for governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care and even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the context of a palliative or final injection already widely used in Canadian medical devices, the Commission requires that it be considered at a time when it is no longer suitable for the reduction of physical disease, for euthanasia and for similar procedures.
Rewards of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their views on the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a medical law specialist, qualified the position of experts-signators of the news as "extreme" beside others because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to the situation when everyone who would be forced to live and who would have been in need of more than 18 years to ask for help to save his life," says Pierre Deschamps, who was studying a summary of the news last night.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the reports have established autonomy of individuals over all other values that create a social advantage of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are sharp signs and restrictions."
Specialist Margaret Somerville of the Medical Law also expressed "strong intentions for the conclusions of the report, which qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society himself, is concerned in particular with the data on the absence of a complaint in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the United States of America.
Jordan's King calls President Assada to withdraw
Damaszek talks about "compulsory"
The Syria is still more isolated
Stoupens Bashar al-Assad had yesterday appeared before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures were intensified on Syria by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, gives them and speaks of "compulsory" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of the Syrian Member State in the League of Arab States, the European Union sent its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries with Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad.
Jordan's king Abdallah II was the first ruler of the Arab state to summon President Bashar al-Assada to kill in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country in his heart, he would have to give up duties, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a country with Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On his behalf, chief of the Turkish diplomat, Ahmed Davutoglu, said that his efforts to secure a dedicated Turkish mediation in the Syrian business regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned successfully.
"Those who don't live in peace with their people in the Middle East and can't leave them," declared the attack on neighboring Syria, while Turkey is still applying the toughest line.
The United States has benefited from "enforcement of consensus against Assad and unfair conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey continue to use a more severe tone" against repression in Syria, reported Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As stated by the Syrian human rights observer, during this time the city of Dera was destroyed in the south of Syria by 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed by shootings and targeted shootings from heavy cults in the city of Jobar" in the area of Homs.
However, at the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moullem concluded that the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
He has recently reacted to the decision of the League of Arab States to stop the Damascus Member State, which represents a "safe step".
Sirie's not coming back," he added with assurance that "compulsions prepared against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to stop Syria, the Member State shall, at the present time, consider the League of Arab States 'the mechanism for the protection of civilians' and shall send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppeé is also a well-inspired idea of sending OSN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he describes as "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League shall be held in Rabat in the morning in order to draw attention to the resolution of the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and in which it was expected, in particular, to remove the armed forces from the city of the armed conflict and the release of the imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lavrov considered the Arab League's decision yesterday to be "missing", while China offered Syria to adopt a crisis resolution plan, but then the aid of any sanctions against Damascus was fully implemented.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifice after Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked for a little time so that he could form his team and start applying a program that would include "victory" with the aim of regaining confidence lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting today with the representatives of the committee and the employees.
It should set up a relatively smooth cabinet composed of technologies that do not belong to parliamentarian parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a messenger of one of the several parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
Mr Gianfranco Fini, President of the Polish film, hopes that Mario Monti will ask Parliament to speak out for confidence in ensuring that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation concludes with Mario Monti's presentation to the small team of 12 ministers of President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness of the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democraticism pays precise terms" when it comes to the preparation of government and its programme, he highlighted and added that it is "sure that the markets will be patient and reasonable".
His appointment to the President had been welcomed from the outset, but the concern was renewed after an unexpected sudden decline in industrial production in the euro area.
The designated Prime Minister should establish a team involving in particular technology, even though he stressed that he would also like to adopt "political".
He confirmed that the new government will remain until 2013, i.e. until the next election date.
According to the president of the Gianfranca Fini, the new government will receive Parliament's trust in the flag.
Mario Monti, after entering the function, promised that he would meet with the extraordinary relief and with the aim of becoming a strong member of Europe again.
The speaker of European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "and our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change with the new government."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the successful plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is the same as the 2013 budget, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the business union of Confindustria Emma Marcagegliov, who met with Montim in the afternoon, focused on the need to revive the economy "or a country that does not show growth can not meet the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing by the authors "relevantly" and "in Italian", represents Italy's "epocalyptic change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The time of his team's life will be very unknown.
President Napolitano would like to make an early vote, because Italy has to place a national debt of EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Sociologist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
Sociologist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that is useful for nuclear weapons, reported in the U.S. government's internship specialized in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) shall describe the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents other than that of the UN Agency.
Last week MAAE reported its "great anxiety" about the possible military size" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS, the expanded MAAE document by V. Danilenko (No. 1934) had been working for three decades in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural), where it was supposed to continue producing synthetic diamonds by the explosive method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamanty" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company were to bring him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he had to cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In his final MAAE report, he recalls "the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" "from the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during the essential part of his career in this technology under the military nuclear programme, where it comes from".
Anti-immomental crime and delinquency rates of 50%
According to the FBI statistics published in the afternoon, the number of criminal acts and disputes directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence was mildly or slightly slow at the same time.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase of 13% in the violence against Catholics, 4% in the persecutions against the Jews and 14% in anti-religious criminal acts and crimes.
The total number of "unresponsible criminal acts" was very light to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by the FBI's racial differences and 20% religious differences.
"After the death in 2009, it is particularly encouraging to see these criminal acts and crimes happen again," the Human Rights First organization highlighted with respect to human rights, "the incidence of anti-timmism violence is particularly significant," the organization added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leading factors of Paul Legendre's organization.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he adds, and concludes that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "unreliable criminal acts".
The hate criminal act in American federal law is a birthday fight for civil rights.
This legal order was adopted after Martin Luther King died to punish violence associated with race, coloring, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and looks more Facebook
The website providing microblogging services on Twitter introduced changes in the afternoon in design to enable its users to monitor the activities of the followers, which somehow compares her Facebook service.
New offers "activity" and "name" allow you to know better and directly the activities of other people who are watching you or the person you are watching ("tweets").
This allows you to know whether they are able to monitor contributions, whether they are eligible for new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new form of Twitter was tested "in August by a small percentage of users" before it was expanded to the whole network on Monday, AFP spokeswoman said Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with some unintelligent terms (RTs for repeated spread of someone else's contribution, followfried for recommending follow-up and other user) making the bonus of the initiatives, also opens up and a larger audience with a more comparable management and that of the big public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network users immediately take the meaning of this innovation into their "tweets" differently.
"It's essential, it takes a lot of places and it's too much like Facebook," writes @ymb123.
"The function of the Action will help me to follow some of my Twitter's primacy," @dannykronstrom wrote.
Rakuusko
the entry into the Constitution of the Golden Rule on a balanced budget
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Rakosko, decided to write in the afternoon the draft budget policy to the Constitution with a view to reducing public deficits and avoiding any reduction in the assessment of Rakouska by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the very social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Ministerial Council in a situation where the French public debt was 74.6% higher than its criteria maximum 60% of the Maastricht agreement established, but much less than the debt of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Rakouska's solvency had been reduced by only one step from AAA to AA+, we should pay every year three billion euros a year," the Foreign Minister and Christian Democrat Michael Spindeleger argued.
France therefore refers to the application of the euro area summit in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government sincerely requested that by the end of 2012, the reduction of public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts should be recorded in the Constitution or in the law of value as well.
The tool adopted by the French government is closer to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (HDP) every year and will start in 2017 the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP every year, while foreign countries, as well as citizens, will have to show a balanced budget.
The aim is to obtain a public debt in the horizon in 2020/21 under the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong only
Node threats new intervention on foreign markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned in the afternoon that the Japanese institutions would have to re-enter the foreign markets if they were to continue in strengthening.
"We'll figure out how we've done this lately, if we're going to find too far-reaching" in the exchange course one, explained to Senator Noda.
On Tuesday, only once again, he joined the historical values which the Japanese authorities brought to the intervention on 31 October.
That day Tokyo sold only for dollars in order to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which recently exceeded the record against the dollar paid since 1945.
But since then, it has been regularly supported by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe haven" in the uncertain times of the world's economic downturn and the European crisis caused by debt.
On Tuesday, the dollar was reimbursed under 77 yens and the euro was placed under the 105 yen’s symbolic wing close to the level that had developed the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, there was a dollar of around 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This plans Japan's exchanges damage to the island exports, as it reflects the price of products from Made and Japan and reduces the value of the profits obtained by Japanese companies from foreigners when they transfer them to domestic exchanges.
"Japan is in a hurry" from the history of coastal earthquakes and wild tsunamis that swept the Tohok region to the north-east of the country, highlighted Y. Noda, who fears that this attack will not be killed in the wake of the Greek resurrection.
The third economic power of the world was restored in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) and this was first in one year due to the study of export growth and household consumption of the affected disasters.
But the Prime Minister pointed out that the high value did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
The Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ) to launch its political and exchange council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures leading to a reduction in the oil supply.
But this multi-guarantee of Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that BoJ had already taken "probably" measures that indicated that no additional change is expected in the medium.
At the end of its final meeting, the final value sheet for the issue of securities increased by EUR 5 billion (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of state depository bonds and increased by EUR 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) to the extent that it was committed to purchases of various securities with a view to charging liquidity.
Eurozone:
The horses stand, the bears fall.
The risk of the debt crisis continues to be covered by European indicators.
By appointing new heads of government in Greece and Italy and by increasing the number of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
Europe's storms are still alarmed by the stability of the euro area today, on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris in 10 hours CAC index 40 is lost by 1.4% on 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new pressures around the profits from the loans of the euro area countries that are in difficulty, still markets with shares around the world are only part of the recent gains."
"Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of harm," explains Terry Pratt, a IG Markets painter, quoted by Reuters.
The poll in Tokyo concluded with a reduction of 0.7%, which suffered because of the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes focused on Europe, and the change will only continue in the difficult corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," explains Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
This re-starting uncertainty regarding the future of the euro area is damaging itself, which continues in its fall in the afternoon.
The euro shall be reached at the lowest level from the time before the month and half.
At 10 hours the European currency is $1,3570 at the rate of 0.4%.
According to the painters, the change occurred after the CDU Chancellor Angely Merkel's party at its Congress adopted the proposed proposal on Monday that it might be possible to leave the euro area for countries that are exposed to difficulties without leaving the European Union.
Italy and Spain rates far beyond 6%
The wage rates in Italy and Spain remain very disturbing.
Today, the amount of Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% in the morning and the amount of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
The pressure on South-European economies, but also in France, continues to increase the concerns of market participants.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly called for a third time to make the situation in Italy a threat to the island due to the rise in its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone summit will be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in the target market direction, when elections are held in the country on Sunday to the parliamentary summit.
The difference between the ten-year bond between Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
In the expected number of euro area-relevant growth
Statistics say that France recorded in the third quarter the economic growth of 0.4% due to the above consumption of households, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the trend of the second quarter to the 0.1% GDP instead of the rate.
And actually, it's the fourth quarter, which is the most disturbing of the economies.
During the same period, Germany recorded an increase of 0.5%.
The first results for the whole euro area are expected in 11 hours, while the European Commission has just warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must triumph over doctrine
If there is a subject that cannot be understood on the basis of short-term developments or emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for the meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the location of energy from the brain.
The debate will be successful only when all economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are currently 7 billion human habitats on the planet, but demographic development has developed from 2050 to double demand by electricity, if we do not want a significant part of the world's population to save an important part of life.
At the same time, there will be a need to address the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to generate electricity, and they will not forget the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, which is the object that is currently mixed from ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident has no impact on any of these parameters.
And that's why Germany only remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case of Belgium, which underlines the need to find another source capable of self-repairing itself, nor of Switzerland, which is considered to be only the right establishment of the last generation.
On the contrary, the Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to make decisions in their projects.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to expand its park on one of the refurbished buildings of one electrical power plant destroyed after the fire of the Three Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is opposed.
Berlin's Volba will show the price of electricity increased by energy dependence on oil imported especially from Russia, a sudden increase in CO2 emissions by electricity generation on ground oil and coal.
All these unpleasant effects have been felt over the past few months.
The Danska case deserves us to think about it.
Europe's air-conditioning campaign, with 30% of which it collects its electricity, is also one of the largest oil and gas consumers because of the lack of electricity, because of the CO2 emissions and the prices of the Danish electricity above 65%, with 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbor's electricity bill will pay 40% higher than the cost of paying French households.
While in the globalised energy economy, the key factor of competitiveness and the guarantee of the maintenance of industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the most expensive electricity in Europe.
For this reason, every significant reduction in nuclear energy share would result in a strong increase in electricity prices, which would result in an illusionful announcement of the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, as does not necessarily stand against this energy, as public opinion studies show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has allowed the sector to be set up with 125,000 direct jobs and with 440,000 jobs.
A strong export industry will attract large numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred to a foreign market.
If France had decided to abandon the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have come up with EUR 6 billion annually, which the country would earn for the export of nuclear devices and services.
Which power owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while the project was planned by his manufacturer?
In solving the energy equation, it should be admitted that there is no cosy source of energy, because there is no Devil.
The development of low CO2 emissions, nuclear devices and renewable energy equipment carried out by the French industrial group AREVA shall be evidence of the complementaryness of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, the absolute need to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a State Agency for Nuclear Safety, which conducts non-compromising and transparent control over existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new electricity in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionals are recognized have a sense of security in blood.
In the past decade, he has seen the nuclear industry with three serious dangers.
The only thing that happened in Three Mile Island was in normal operation and remained without human sacrifice and consequences for the environment.
In Montenegro the drama caused the concept of the reactor and unrecognizable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the disaster was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this disaster just as it did in the past two years.
With this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers are that the EPR reactor is capable of delivering the concept to such enemies.
While all interested parties who are committed to establishing a nuclear power plant consider it, the suspension of its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered by the AREVA Group and the EDF Group and by allowing the road to strengthen its leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be inappropriate to let emotions, thoughts and machines rule the debate so far as to resolve the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is the immigration economy a burden or a chance?
The immigration policy carried out by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised by various tasks - police arrests, courts and administrations of a given number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights", where France is hungry.
It was recently an administrative burden which foreign students were presenting when the Minister of the Interior (see Liberation of 23 May) announced that France "needs foreign talents, walls and servers".
But recently, it was only a few years ago that the economy was cut off.
It is necessary to say that in this area, there is a wide consensus between the left and the right.
In 1976, a tone hit Jacques Chirac by his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrants are found" and on the left when Michel Rocard said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the rest of the world."
The only difference is the degree of greatness
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the pride of the Polish installations on the French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are considered a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of greatness that we are urged to provide to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is limited to bananas when he believes that joint development will be able to solve our "migrating problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be paid in elections, but economics are very expensive.
How to remember the economics Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in their recently published work with the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exclusive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p. 352): There is a wide consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, gender and employment in countries where immigrants are receiving.
Limitation of immigration protects growth and employment damage.
The concerns of migrant victims are based on the idea that these people can reward French workers, in particular those less qualified, and create pressure to lower their breasts.
But experience shows that, in fact, there are many more immigrants than those who are paid for their French employees by performing jobs in the sectors with fewer employees.
Low qualifications of immigrants in sectors that do not belong to French employees and that are the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not a place offer.
Positive effects on the brain
Just like the surgeon, there will be problems with work in the country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these supplements between France and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive impact on the minds and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real-life between 0.6 and 0.9%.
Furthermore, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants is contributing to the development of thinking and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were established).
In European countries, migrants are also contributors to social systems averagely up to 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization, for example, suggests that in Germany one immigrant will come in 30 years of age to bring his entire life into public budgets a net contribution of EUR 150000 (before a reduction in expenditure) 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his invitation to come for the missing percentage of "stupid teeth".
The said teeth used to detect immigrants had a really negative effect.
Europe's finding democracy, leaving behind the idea of European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very Greek goods.
The European continent should bear in mind this, although it had been invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, the tragedy of world wars, total regimes, holocausts, strikes, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and Colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that if democracy finally triumphs over their enemies, it will be enough to make a vote and do it the best way.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General voluntary law, perhaps a condition of democracy, is not a condition that is sufficient and can become a "stitch tool" as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, division and power control, education, education, education, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is right and from the beginning the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the faults of the Greek referendum will not be in this direction of double recognition: the recognition of the need for a great return to political power, but also the recognition of the disturbing feeling of his incompatibility, his incompatibility.
This ambivalent must be considered in order to be convinced.
It is true that the front line of democratic reconciliation has been moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer fighting in the right direction.
We cannot get anything if we require a number of national rapporteurs organized according to the need and de-organised.
White presented by the European absolute monarchy or jump with his legs tied to an empty nationalist deep: what a choice for citizens!
No, we don't want gilotine knifes, but common, full-time, peaceful and uninterrupted exercise of elections and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we wouldn't even know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
This is the whole of Europe that is committed to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies that suffer from their incompatibility and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international scene.
We are disappointed with the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but this is the whole of Europe, which will gradually lose its sovereignty and with it every one of its peoples.
It is urgent to return to the management of the European project of democratic superiority.
Because only together will the power of Europe be able to reduce the burden of its debt, free market governments and prepare for the future.
The outcome of the crisis will predetermine a decision at European level which will not be able to be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it will lead us to the grave.
After our long fight against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today urgently calls for a European economic government.
Wake up.
But think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such citizens would be a new madness and a new dark street.
We need to take a new stage in European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it must have been "republicated".
The revolution in the interest of this could not be enough.
This lesson is going on.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will be possible only by building Europe more political democratic and genuine European democratic superiority.
Let's get to Europe to build Europe.
"No contact" chip cards are spreading
In the optimistic atmosphere, it opens in the evening near the village of Villepinte, Paris, the world's largest ski resorts.
According to the Eurosmart Cabinet, 2011 would end with an increase in world sales of carats with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards) by 11% for more than 6 billion units.
The most pressing is a segment of contact-free technology that allows you to pay in a collective way or to rent purchases by just getting close to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world 460 million chips against 320 million sales last year!
In 2012, their share would still have to rise (expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total market with chip cards (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the country of APEC, Europe is getting a land free of contact payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, there are more modest beginnings: 400,000 visa-free cards have been issued.
But big business chains are working for two.
Carrefour released 2.5 million without contact with Pass MasterCard this year.
To order a higher rate of speed, the bank needs to equip its customers from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically to their customers in the future free bank cards," reports Gérard Nébouy, director-general of Visa Europe France.
Banks are trying to pay for the cell phone
But this is the first step towards the payment medium: mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is needed for the operation of the transaction today only a small number of devices.
"We've got a delay."
"But their real mix should come next year."
"In 2012, we will re-examine their world sales to 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready.
The Crédit Agricultural Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in the city of Caen, which will take place from December to June next year.
The iPhone facilities will provide approximately 200 customers and employees with free access.
BPCE has a similar project in Štrasburk and Marseille.
And yesterday, the Society also announced that it is preparing to make an offer that allows its customers to pay without charge for their mobile phone.
A terrorist front from Sahary to Nigeria
The couple are worried about the alliances between Al-Qaydu in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicion that there are alliances with the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sector are confirmed.
On Sunday instead of Algeria's foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has been "insure" since now.
"The way both organisations operate, and the reports of intelligence services show that there is great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have a similar analysis.
An investigation by two French enthusiasts in Niger in January 2010 could help to shed light on the related bridges.
After the arrest of AQMI members from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed at the same time as several of their detainees during the operation by the special French units.
In the winters after the siege, the French and Nigerian explorers had to find several telephones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Osna
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, which has long remained in Maiduguri, the city north of Nigeria, which is the village of Boko Haram, and the other to the man who is said to be close to the AQMI and the sect.
"It's a step forward, but it's absolutely necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We've known for years that the sect has been enjoying external financial and intellectual support and that it's becoming increasingly active," Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same way as those used by the AQMI organisation.
The international community on the head of Washington has since produced pressure on Nigeria to address the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group of refined mystics to be of little interest.
Fastgame speed
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near the masses, schools and fundamentalists Mohamed Yusufa. Boko Haram, which in the Haousas language means "the Western education is sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emuratum on the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a link has rapid success.
The sect is political and requires strict adherence to Islamic law, while its supporters are fighting against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram's supporters became extremely active and reported their attacks on police stations.
The government's reaction is as usual as it is.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf section is arrested and killed in prison.
From now on, the group is radicalising and leaving its way north.
During the summer of 2010, the city of Jos, where 80 people are left behind, will be held next to Abuja's capital.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police during his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local authorities of the UN will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist island in Africa, which would have to move from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since troubled all security experts.
Now that Al-Qaeda's Islamic Maghreb has captured Mali and the game and the Somalis from the Al-Shabab nest are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, speaking with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said France is in the state of readiness and is ready to "deliver all information".
World by candidates to the President
In questions relating to China, Iran or Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are presented in simplification and ignorance.
Can America cope with a weakened crisis by helping simple or even simplistic thinking?
At the hearing of presidential candidates, the voters could think of it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated silent statements and expert guidance on foreign policy, which are already traditionally strong against the Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated reports about China, Iran, or Israel’s assistance affect one another.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate on behalf of the Republican's Grand Old Party, threatened China's call to the World Trade Organization and their accusations "because of manipulation with their currency", which is a hot topic in America that has been exposed to migration all parts of its industry towards Asia.
The top one, if this has to include the launch of a trade war in itself, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's spokesman in China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, had little interest in the existence of a "sustaining" emotion.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last places in the polls, remains unresponsible.
To the image of President Reagana
Romney also promised military authorities in Iran if they fail to succeed in stopping his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'm bound to Iran," declared Fanfaron.
"If Obama is again elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance, accusing Obama of violating his obligations to this partner.
Lieutenant Herman Cain, the second most popular candidate, shows a sudden lack of knowledge of documents.
He recently called for a sharpness against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing "has been trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - obviously unknown facts that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to defeat Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmanno.
All are far away from the fact that in 2008 the Republican candidate John McCain was a hard-on-the-fashioned foreign policy.
Opposers of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and still won a student war.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the successes of his innovative dialogue with Iran, the inevitable departure from Iraq, his comments on Libya, and thus attach to him a poor reputation.
But the attack is not easy.
The citizens consider President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Ládin, more positively.
Iraq has no confidence in military principles that lead to defeat.
And with arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America's economy so that its leadership can be restored, Obama's key to a better place.
Nord Stream, new entry point of the Russian river into Europe
The long river North Stream, which connects directly to Eastern Europe in Russia, and led by the Baltic Sea, began to operate.
He's got to add a plane equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian Plynary, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 chief states and government, have participated in the opening of the North Stream, a new river that connects Russia and Germany directly below the sea.
Symbolical German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte were surrounded by the ruling wind of the Russian fleet's entry into the Western European network.
This new pipeline will begin to extend to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian river with the first search for 1,224 km of the Petrohrad region with the Mecklemburg-Weather.
The second effort to be completed by the end of 2012 is to provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the amount equal to the total French consumption.
And it's already recalled the possibility of setting up a third attempt on the same track.
For Gazprom, it has a temporary completion of this vast building of the character of victory.
The project was strongly protested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
In fact, Nord Stream will be able to provide electricity directly to Germany without being carried out by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Once again, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pressure on Russia's threats to close access to the Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
Most strongly expressed it in Warsaw when it failed to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with a call for an alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying it's a political feeling.
Western Europe has gained greater security of its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But this is for the price of reducing Europe's energy, because the project has created barriers between Eastern and Western Europe.
Just five years ago, Russia was able to extend its view of the direct link between Russia and the rich western states with high oil consumption, whose wages are close to its end.
"This plane is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new storm that connects us organically," said François Fillon in a celebration of the opening of this pipeline, and demonstrated how large plynary contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of the leaders of Gazprom who are present in a large number in Lubmin, the leading place of the river.
The status of this fluoride is also a significant technical factor.
The underwater effort is made by a concrete platform designed to be protected from any seagoing vessels.
It counts on the seabed in the average depth of 200 m.
At his building, he had to avoid the mined field that began from the time of World War II.
"Because of their safety, they had to be almost a hundred removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to raise measures for the protection of faunas and flora.
Self-testing is a long-distance battleship weighing as 242 Eiffellocks, which is never interrupted by any valves or maintenance stations throughout its length.
One control area had to be built near Sweden, but the leading project had to be closed when Sweden had little desire to see the Russian state society, as it continues to operate around its borders.
"In the event of a strike, we will stop the flow in less than 1 minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of uncertainty, the fluid contained in the fluid is kept out of the air.
But this case has been considered a little unlikely, since the measurements have been designed to create uncertainty once in 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the water outlet shall be carried out by a sea-based robot, while the inlet of the water is controlled by a device that circles inside.
This device of a diameter of 1 m is inserted into the inside of the test and pressed by a gas.
For the purpose of the three-day journey, the speed of 3 m/s shall provide precise information on any deformational parts.
A long flight was designed to work for forty years without the need to be more self-restraint.
The flow cycle is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
In order to achieve this project, five companies joined.
The lead position remains in the Gaza Strip, which holds 51%.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The basement has a seat in the city of Zoug in Switzerland, where the building is extremely convenient.
Gazprom subsequently hired this company for five years in a contract that can be renewed, all its capacity for the transport of gas.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity to be the amount of real transportable gas," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline construction was ensured by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
Total labour costs should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both of them.
For the GDF Suez group, such investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned, because they take the risk of taking on themselves only Gazprom.
Swimming from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with bourgeois trees.
Winds up to 4.5 meters create an exit barrier to the river.
The imager shall measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming rain before being transported to the German fluoride.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - signwriter
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded decades ago, wants to regain the joy of writing.
It brings the victory of favor, the hour of the singing in the light of the light.
The writer of Moleskine is easily distinguished by his black desks and his lists of white colors, such as ageing.
However, the writer of Moleskin, as we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo sits in Milan will then decide to place a new design but a distinguished writer on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is interested in introducing a new product.
The writer is inspired by an old manufacturing technique "moleskin" (mites of skin), which is used for example to fix the surface of a violet.
This type of writer was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has returned to the shape of an old and forgotten object, which was the icon of avantgard artists until the 20th century," reports Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a leading figure in the fashion fashion company.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales rate rose by 26% in order to rely on 12.7 million coins last year.
The situation is a distance from the first years of production when only 3,000 writers were produced.
Moleskine crosss the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to set up an art portrait of the purchaser, because the writer will take business as much as a student or a professional.
The image of the writer Moleskine is that its owners are human beings of cosmopolitanism, culture and open spirit.
A small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has almost 100 employees today and has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York since 2008.
He sent his writers to the library and through the FNAC trade chain to small shops in the middle of the city where he was able to pass his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this need for a new writing, through the explosive development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature provides for the development of the writer Moleskine: recently opened the exhibition "Shit", where architects or artists set up their writer.
In August at the time of the film festival in Locarn, she also introduced a new desk to the writer who remembered the novelty.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, newspapers, complaints, views on notebooks ... The sign expands to a wide range of loads.
The success of the project: in the autumn of 2006, Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment funds, today’s Syntegra Capital, written by the new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high share of unemployed handicraft workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today it will open 15 weeks to employ handicrafts.
According to the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons is twice as high as average, i.e. 19% as 9% for the whole population.
Is that exciting?
"No, he supports Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, who organizes a week to hire handicrafts."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, there was no percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"But there's still much more to do."
It must be said that for unemployed persons, there are many obstacles to their access to work.
One is older: 37% has more than 50 years (17% average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have math, and of the 2.3 million high school students are only 10,000 disabled.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in handicrafted sales 38% in average.
In short, these are the criteria that are particularly difficult to come back to employment and which represent "the root of the problem", according to Christiana Grapina, Director-General of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992, to help businesses accept handicrafted workers.
That's how it's about objective speed.
There's no way of thinking that's going to develop, but it's too small.
A study carried out in the IMS-Entrepreprenere pour la Cité found that the questions of managers have a low level of knowledge about the disabled" with a "representative of persons on the road and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far away from achieving the goal of employing 6% of the eligible workers laid down in the 1987 Act.
The most recent figures coming from 2008 provide a level of 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of the Agefiph organization entrusted with the selection of payments from businesses that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is that the number of "indicted" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 provinces to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real understanding, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees are employed by manual workers to sell 82% of businesses to 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What luck"
Before the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens were released on Tuesday evening (20h45) they were not satisfied with this friendly greeting.
We're not going so far to write that there was a division between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to him at the Stade de France Court of Justice, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard soon died.
Five months after the angry gesture of his opponent, in a plot against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave his player only words of praise.
"I am very calm with Eden and his progress, and the fact is that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," swears the player of the French Lille.
When it comes to the difference between his performance in the club races and the national men's, "it's one and the same, it justifies."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Hazard, who was shot against Romania on Thursday night because of this plot against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "square".
They can't even remember the term "happy".
Play against Bleus, who has been up for 7 years and in their winning ranks in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This needs to add more to the "special" character of this meeting.
More about this, because against 'Mathieu (Debuchy), Johann (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),' he recalls.
"We crossed right away."
"The power to play against him, it's just fun!"
Well done, Leekens also mentioned "hrodost."
"Hrdost" to fight the song - Christmas."
"Hrdosst" also found in the quality of "suspends", that France became a very high team over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc has done a huge job," he sighed.
Perhaps Belgium will miss the next mystery of Europe, a technical footballist would like to see in 2014 in the airport with France... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're healthy."
"Be aware of this for the next game." including against France.
Portugal is very aware of
The Portuguese poet Paulo Bento is engaged with a large optimistic barrier against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it. The Portuguese football representation, in which its cormida has been in 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal's in good luck in 90 minutes.
There's one game to play and one enemy to Bosnia.
In the knowledge of the fifth result (0-0) in the beautiful Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal must have been more than an hour's drive, but it was not able to give him such a nice head that would take him away.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk, because we haven't put our balls outside."
But at home at their amazing Stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, Portugal is convinced that they are facing a public who should create a hot ball, even though the game is definitely called "very balanced", says the optimistic, but the stars consider Bento.
"We expect a very balanced game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a plan," said a 20-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance to be at the Euro 2012," said Carlos Quiiroze, still relativating.
An undisputed flagship party in Bosnia requires Portugal to head and win.
An unsolved trap can be set for Bosnians, who also need to be taken care of.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk, because we haven't gone out," Bento laments.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
Just like in Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing the Bosnian team right from the start of the maximum pressure so that "they don't have time to think about it."
A good idea, provided that it can be realistic this time.
