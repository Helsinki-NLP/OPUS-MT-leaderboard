Can I go to the theater if there's no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the Olga Godusus.
And if a healthy person just stops his job, should he go to the library?
We need health-care breathing not only for treatment but also for the prevention of diseases.
Under the schedule, a person can check his body's condition and receive the doctor's recommendations to live so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be left to anyone.
"Just stand out of the job" is an important signal of the body, it must not be removed from it.
Continual stress, mental and physical respiration can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And there's 90 percent of those who're coming.
His greatest challenge was that of people in large cities from 45 to 55 years of age.
So it's better not to make things difficult and allow yourself time to breathe.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people reduce their biological age while in cirrhosis.
Modern calendars offer a comfortable atmosphere for the entire family.
So if you want to take a vacation with the children, you don't have to stay with them.
For children, even the smallest, health programmes include diagnostic services, pedagogical advice, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many of the cataracts there are children's swimming pools), inhalation, special diet mode, massages, oxygen cocktails, treatment physics.
The course of the procedure defines the doctor, taking into account individual signs and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, there is usually a child club with animators where children can visit games, different master classes.
Some schedules open their doors even for guests with young people, provide the pregnant women with the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nurse.
The soft winter, long summer, the abundance of sun-days in the year (over 300) creates good weather conditions for the calendars of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So there is no need to be afraid of windows, since most procedures are in the room and no one is dependent on the season.
In general, cirrhotic treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main branch of the Caucasus Mineral Water Region, of course, is the medical sources: Slovenia, Smyrna, Essentuki, Narzan.
They have unique properties and influence on the various systems of the body.
Water varies according to temperature, amount of salt, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor collects water depending on the patient's feelings.
Yes, Narzan has anti-immunodomulating activities and restores the functions of the iron and steel treaty and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 is affected by the iron-kicking tract, reducing the sugar level.
The New Essentoki is an anti-spatial, wild, and powerful action.
They also have the effect of the "Slovenianaska" water.
The condition of the heart-cooperative system is obliged to be taken into account when administering water.
If there are signs of hypertonia, it collects less salt water, because salts stop the fluid, resulting in increased pressure.
The use of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the required amount and at a specific temperature.
There are now various cosmetic procedures available for the person and the body.
What kind of health care based on the natural characteristics of North Caucasus can be obtained at the regional courses?
Near Pitgürska, for example, there is a salt lake in Tambukan, a olive grove that is useful for the bodies, the telephone, the internal organs.
It provides an anti-proliferation anti-immunodomulating action.
These are health delays on individually built routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovadsk, where there is a large Kurutt Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is directly close to the mineral source of Narzan.
There you can also take the vans of wines, vegetables, yodosomes, rurals, shalfeno-larc, depending on what your doctor will give you.
Let's go over the fruit.
What do you do to grow a shell by the end of the season?
She's talking about Julia Belopohova, agronom, and a nurse.
The high-core tomatos are to set up a string: to remove the new ones, to cut the machetes, to remove all the leaves to the last one with fruits and flowers with small bindings - they can't stand up.
All topics, regardless of the "constitution", as well as the conversion and packaging, are subcarbated by the oil superphosphate extract, processed by biofuels (Azorevailer - to speed up the flow and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Phitolavin, Gamair, Bactophytoft - from disease, Immunocytophytitis - to improve immunity, Bitoxibicillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm - if there are injury).
Of the chemicals at the end of the summer should only be used as milk powder, colloidal cheese and green butter.
We're doing the last field of plants.
In the heat we drop out of the pits, so that the lower, the lower part of the tree (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, the warm water and the solution of the zircon, the bottom of the tree is 5-7 cm.
It is also difficult to extend the fruit of the cassava: cut old leaves, pour hot water and solve the complex improvement, cut down the fruit line under the chest.
In order to protect from night-time colds, place a thick cloth with a covered material.
On the day of growth, keep open and close after sunset.
End tag.
What shows that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
The economists have seen signs of Russia's departure from the last twenty years of the recession.
As noted by Bloomberg's analysis agency, the RFCs demonstrated positive dynamics, which decreased by 0.8 per cent per year in the second quarter of GDP.
This is the minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to Russia's latest data, the fall in the Russian economy in the second quarter has slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The situation has also recently been stabilized by the Central Bank and the Minéconomic Development.
Before, it's a slow growth.
According to experts from the CBR, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The index assessment of the Russian GDP is that the recession remains behind, and before it is slow economic growth," says the Russian Bank "What the trends are talking about".
The modular assessment of GDP in the current quarter of regulators increased by 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter was 0.5 per cent.
As reported by the representative of the Minéconomic Development, during the second quarter the decline of the RFP remained in the second quarter, with 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleansed drop of GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter, the decline occurred: it was 0.2 per cent in April, and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15," quoted the MERE RIA "News".
The slowdown in the Russian economy during the last five quarters shows that it has been “one-way”.
Among other markers that indicate the survival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls for increased demand for electricity and rail transport, business livelihood.
If an adjustment is made to that year's height, it is understood that the dynamics of more than 1 per cent of electricity consumption can be half caused by additional working days.
Add a lower average temperature in the first quarter.
The following argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus 0.5 per cent of the six-year-old can also explain the season," explains Cyril Jacobenko of ALOR BROKER.
In addition, there are other more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price of pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks of Rostat's reflections of deflation.
The prices in Russia fell in the first five years.
Looking at the dynamics of the ruble course, which, although demonstrated strong collapsing at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since August.
It is also one of the indicators of recovery that must be taken from the real economy sector," Yavonenko stressed.
In addition, since April, the increase in industrial production has been observed.
In June, the rate grew by 1.7 per cent.
The rates of external trade fell from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics also demonstrate the situation on the labour market where unemployment is reduced to 5.4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the favourable situation on the labour market, the question of the real income of the population is to leave it to a better one.
The annual figure is reduced by 4.8 per cent.
This factor could slow the recovery of the economy, as household costs have little contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the economy is over 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the risk factors for economic growth can also be called the strict policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not better in the real sector.
The negative factor is also a insufficient level of investment, which impedes industrial capacity development.
However, it is generally assumed that by the end of the year, the rate of decline in the RFF will slow to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” said GK Forex Club Irina Rogova, analyst.
The naturalization of sportsmen, recently launched in the Russian football and well-lived in winter sports in the Olympics in Sochi, has not developed so actively in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and the former foreigners are speaking, in most cases it is about priests of the former republic of the Soviet Union.
So in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - enough Russians are under the flag of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of civilization is different.
Some parents have even introduced to another country as a child, not leaving the choice.
Someone did not hold on to competition as a part of the Russian assembly.
And someone thought that there would be better conditions for sports development beyond the border.
AIF.ru found at least 16 sportsmen who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
A 27-year-old girl wrote in a German passport called Lisa Rígh.
But she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
All four years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, Lisa’s parents decided to immigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go to her older sister's place to take a easy flight.
Like her sister, Lisa chose a dress with a six - year - old.
She'd stay in Russia if she could've been able to "drive with the throne" Ellen Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa, Rio Lisa will be our only farm, even if it was old, in the field for rice with six.
Its best achievements in this kind of sport are the 2010 European champion bronade and the serious continental predominance in 2016, which it once again experienced in the absence of Elena Isinbaev.
The 29th year of Elena Pirozkova was born in Novokusnetke in 1986.
Her parents were religious evangelical preachers.
A lot of them because of their faith and they went to the United States when the girl was three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started to get into school.
With good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where the U.S. Educational Centre continued to operate under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izbojnikov.
In the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first impression.
That's why the champions of peace are winning in the same year.
In the meantime, she managed to win the 2010 World Cup.
It was then the 2013 and September 2014 bronze.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in the city of Yaroslav, where she first met with a synchronous swimming pool.
But saying that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to immigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There Maria continued her job.
She had recently joined the United States and had shown great results in the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, it could not produce competition, but for America, its indicators were descendants.
A new name, which Russians feel strange, was received by Cristina Shaalbin at 11 years of age when her parents decided to continue the training of a girl of divine science in the ocean.
Meanwhile, the girl was a favorite sport in the family of Yaroslav.
Emigrant in the United States, she quickly entered the youth assembly in that country, and later she joined the main national team.
In the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen was wearing gold and silver.
The first position at the world scene was, of course, not going to fight, but for the United States, it organized this break - a star-to-speech collection at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our ex-girlfriends is Jan Berezco Margrander, who talks about Germany's collection.
She was born in Tolitati.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more hope of getting to the national assembly.
She had recently represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, of course, she was able to take only 17 places that were not enough to fall into the final concentration in private.
So two years ago, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games -- young people.
Another gymnasium, only this time sports is Irina Sazonova.
If the migration routes mentioned above can be considered standard, the choice of the family of Irina is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a teacher of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she has become a champion country.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - she is particularly visiting the family so as not to lose her skill.
In Rio she was not as successful as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in the personal multi-war.
There are very little information about the brutal Maria Ugolko in the Russian Information Area.
For a very long time, Maria lived and trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it was under the Russian flag, showing poor results - even the country's record was 200 metres away by bitterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to speak under the white flag.
In Rio, it's the best expression - 14 places in a 4×100 complex.
To get ready for the game, the girl launched a kradfanding project that enabled her to collect about 6,000 francs that had enabled her to pay for training in the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, played his whole career under the Russian flag.
Meanwhile, the teacher of Hasavurta was able to become a three-fold champion of European champions, a Russian champion, a Russian sports master of the international class.
When he stopped falling into our national assembly, time came to think about the change in civilization.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports clubs.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian champion Batirov had already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
For another ex-Russian, Michael Cuddinova, the family is more known than even the Swiss poet Maria Ugolkov.
It's because his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started playing sports.
He did not achieve greater international success.
In Rio, his best score was 40 positions in parallel bourgeoises.
But for New Zealand, even the fall on Olympic Games in sports is already a break.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There the girl continued her activities with a synchronous flow, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a 6th place in a synchronous swimming pool was held at the European Championship in Berlin.
In the case of Evgion Tetelbaum, Anastasia took the eighth place.
It was the fifth in the solar programme.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyter speaks for Israel.
When the boy was six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitry was already a champion of the country.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later Croyter won the gold of the young Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to the tallest ones, Dmitry is the tallest one and the third one.
31-year-old Albert was another teacher of Hasavurta, who, after a long speech for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Baturav, Albert chose Romania, which will also be represented in Rio.
In Russia, he spoke about the School of the High Sports Masters of Krasnoyarsk, and in 2011 he became a champion of the country.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the SCR-consumer for the volleyball of Yaroslav Antonov.
In a literal year before his son Yaroslav was born, he was recognized by the best volleyballist planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
At the same time, the family remained in permanent residence.
In 2015, he became a national team of European champions who took part in the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and died with his family in the worst war.
Ten years later, parents decided to immigrate.
Norway had a significant goal, but in this northern country, it had failed - to move to France, in Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the lead of peace among young people and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio he will be the only representative of France in the fight tournament.
And a free fight again, and a former Russian once again.
This time, it will be about the celebration of the North Ossetia, which has immigrated in Spain - about the Times of Freeway.
By the end of December 2012, he had received a Spanish citizenship, and he is now serving as a collective member of the country.
Before that, the 30-year-old sportsman has been able to note the high results in Russia.
He became a bronze champion of the country in 2007 and 2008.
The Constitution of the Non-Discriminations of the Assembly, Tamuras decided to change the sportic citizenship.
The last of our list is the Czech boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachkale, Arthur Bierslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents brought the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began to work as a boxer on his older brother’s board.
Since then, Arthur has been a Canadian champion, and in 2012 he has become a champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new family since 1975.

Why do kids say classes at school?
According to Governor V. Condrateva, "it is said that we need to review not by actions and parades, but by the system."
They must grow up and at least seven years of age understand that they must speak and education.
But as long as this job seems to me, it's going to be formal, and I suspect it's more on the book.
I'd be happy if the class speakers put all the positive things in place that have been compiled before, at a quality new level.
If we're all successful and we don't know how the new idea turns out to be populism.

Things don't get excited, they're slow.
And "helps" in this extremely complex housing legislation, she considers Lightlan Desorstornova, Executive Director of the NP HCH Control.
We can't work on one law, as we think of a new one that must stop working in the past.

And that means that the housing and communications services market will not be able to break down the normal companies that want to work honestly rather than "give" the population.
There are residents in the mines, small and medium-sized businesses as well.
First of all, through the elimination of corruption as such in all States, Anton Jarkov, a member of the Lord's Committee on Property Affairs.
And now this work is going on.
These are not just unilateral actions. It is a targeted course to combat corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a bad situation.
In particular, it's in the chair and it doesn't fall.
Why is Moscow not able to have such scans in the area of JHG, as in many other regions?
Since the capital government has expressed its iron will and order, Anatolio, a member of the Committee of the Lords on Security and Anti-Corruption, told Anatolio.
I have a personal question, legislative amendments, and legal education.
The administering companies have been supervised and all of them have been licensed.
The city ' s complaints are resolved in public space (and the treatment of residents, and response measures are placed at the Government of Moscow's port).
Many not only pay monthly allowance but pay attention to how the house is kept.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow has verified the justification for housing and communications services, since a small part of the budget is subject to subsidies and benefits for many categories of people.
Probably all of this together and explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Is everything beyond the reach of regional authorities?
Could it be that the place of work should be changed for free?

Can Erdogan renounce friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkey's President, Rajep Taipe Erdogan, gave the US ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fétchulla Gulen, an Islamic preacher charged with the organization of government conversion.
He made a statement in the presence of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up their support to the "Terrorist Fetholist Organization".
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the gap in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"America either sooner or later makes a choice between Turkey and FETO (the terrorist organization of the fetholist).
Either organizing the transformation of FETO, or democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice," the Anatolysian Agency quotes Erdogan, who called in the middle of the night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey, on a regular basis, had already strongly requested the United States to comply with his first request after the strike.
We remember that on 16 July, Turkish military seniors in Turkey were under an attempt to force the legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of the State.
However, after Rejep Erdogan spoke to the population, the village was subjected to torture and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In all, some 8,000 people were suspected of falling into the ranks of teachers and scientists in addition to the wars.
According to Rajep Erdogan, their teacher, Fethulla Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., spoke.
Ordoganists have also allowed themselves to be mixed up in the convents and to be directly American.
The United States has examined all claims in its address by refusing to issue Guilena and recommend changing the tone.
The last statement by the representatives of the House of Lords on this account was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, it does not remain the President of Turkey - he insists on himself and also demands his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the Euro-Union unless Brussels calls for the date of removal of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Minister of Turkey said on 9 August on EU cases, Omer Chelik.
In his statement, the introduction of Ankara's amendments to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would threaten Europe's own security.
We note that on August 1, Germany's vice-president Zigmar Gabriele had forced Turkey to close the Euro Union's visas with a promise to open the border for migrants in order to facilitate visa with the EU.
His words were the answer to the relevant statement of the head of the IMD of Turkey Mévulta Chavoşoglu.
Another provocational statement by Chauuşoglu was made in the short term, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish MD did not exclude that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the area of defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign States in the field of defence - to import rockets," Chavoshoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to establish its own defence system based on its technologies and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but we have not been satisfied with the results, and we have been looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that all of this refers to the serious differences in Turkey's West and the country ' s orientation in the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Evgeni Mincenko, believes that Rajep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go into a violent confrontation with the West.
It is very closely linked to the West and from business point of view and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I believe that Erdogan will try to balance the framework with the West.
Although, of course, it would be much easier for Americans to see at this point as a complete human being," explains AIF.ru expert.
According to him, it is not excluded that after the Turkish leader's statements (on non-payment of EU compensation, on the demand for non-Visual space with Europe and the release of Gulena from the United States) will be awarded to him.
"Radzep Erdogan is faced with the deterioration of relations with America and with the Euro-Union, which will be given to him on the humanitarian issue, for the dictatorial methods of country administration, and so on," Mincenko says.
The Head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, agrees that the President of Turkey changes his point of view in relation to Russia as soon as that will be useful to him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very harsh position with regard to Russia and in all ways sought the favor of the West.
The situation has changed in a very short time.
The guarantee that, for some time, the President of Turkey has not changed his priorities, no.
I think Erdogan has entered the period of forced diplomacy.
As between the two sides of the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Muchin believes.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain the political authority in the country and, as a matter of time, Russia and the partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting the United States.
Turkey also needs the EU and the United States, which, with its help, controls the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, the consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert believes.
Another point of view is the head of Asia and the Middle East of Anna Glazova.
The relationship between Turkey and the EU and the United States is now sufficiently tense, and this is primarily linked to the internal policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I believe that this crisis will be strengthened, and the Turkish leadership will, on the basis of this crisis, try to relaunch policies both in the Middle East and in Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, have declared that they are ready to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, which have been resolved with Israel, is going to be an active political interaction with Iran," IIF.ru Glazova explained that Erdogan's next step will become a normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy currently being carried out by Erdogan is a return to the course of an external political concept that has been pursued by Turkey before the start of the Arab revolution.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in a very active way.
The very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have now been made.
Therefore, this external policy vector will develop and promote the strengthening of Turkey's positions both at the regional and international levels," he believes.
The vote believes that returning Turkey to former relations with the EU will be extremely difficult, but now the issue of whether the EU will respond more strongly to Turkey, which can go beyond the borders of migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Young doctors' arrest: Calls for new collective protests
The representatives of young doctors have requested a professional union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute about a new labour contract.
The Committee of the Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to request its full Council to support more collective protests since September.
JDC says the ministers failed to respond to the questions of the labour contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted in favour of termination of the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was removed from 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, President JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to "simply shut" about the problems that she had said led to the withdrawal of the employment treaty.
She said, "In view of the complex situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of the rejection of the proposed new employment treaty in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your issues."
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC leader today made an official request to the extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme for the expansion of collective protests, which began in early September.
The survey led to the participation of young doctors in six abortions this year, including the first universal abortions in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the young doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavana, withdrew after voting in favour of the agreed terms of the contract of employment recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was good and should be accepted during the meetings before the 44,000 young doctors and medical students vote.
After the vote, the Minister for Health Jeremy Hunt said that this working contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of Bads?
It was the heat that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hold their hands and declare the official end of the eight-month war and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the rented hall of the castle in St. Petersburg, I was impressed with the fact that Ankara wants this more peace.
It was a glove, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s mildness seemed attractive, and it was not easy for him to find warmth even for his own standards.
Recep Tayip Erdogan, on the contrary, spoke repeatedly about his "other road" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their level of doctrine but even above.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing had ever happened.
For example, his enthusiasm was supposed to be reversible.
But the prolonged hunger from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the opening comments: Turkey became a Russian shooter at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was wrong at the time.
Mr. Putin became angry, accusing Ankara of being attacked by Moscow in the back.
It was even stronger, depending on what was supposed to happen.
The restoration of real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
Over the months, the IMO-controlled State has carried out a shocking, complete arrival in Ankara.
It was suddenly shown that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious charges were that Mr. Erdogan's family had been engaged in illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly rejected it.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that time had come to move further.
At the end of the meeting, it was only because Mr. Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory for its species.
For Ankara the advantage of declaring peace is clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he's almost turned off his post last month when he's trying to change.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have left him dead, too.
There is also economic reason.
The Russian sanctions have been severed — particularly a ban on charter flights, which are usually carried by several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number dropped by nearly 90 %.
With regard to Russia, Turkish operators and charity companies here, of course, feel relieved when the flights are finally renewed.
They're putting a peak at the end of the Mediterranean season.
Even this week, public television predicted more fruit and vegetables than Turkish agricultural imports would be allowed again.
"The tourists there, the funerals back here," said a report in the news newspaper.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil in the West because she thinks it's a weak response to the attempt to change.
Add to this her deep disappointment as she talks about EU accession and Mr. Putin's step, which seeks to exploit hunger and gradually destroy Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus ball with Ankara for the support of the elected authorities after a coup attempt.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
Thus, the summit of this shining port on the coast of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to point out that one analyst described me as "a bad alliance": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently held itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may only be that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, two presidents had given a press conference, they had not even touched this subject.
Turkish President Putin deliberately avoided the response to the question of their differences, while Mr Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster when a NATO member became a Russian reactive shooter, it is much better that two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
Brand RBS shall be informed of the role of the branch office, as the Executive Director of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to global banking ambitions.
The bank has abandoned them since he moved almost eight years ago and had to save it.
In this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of sponsorship funds for international sport from Cuba, from six countries on the river to the Wimbledon Andy Murray Championship.
But it was now decided that it was right to allow more national brands to go to the first level.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all transfers to RBS, including the external headquarters and the fund office, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking, which will have more influence on private individuals — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview at the time of a round of clients and staff in Inverness.
He said to BBC Scotland: "Bred RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be involved, because we are now becoming the largest bank of the brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Now I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of Cuba of six nations, and it will increase the profile of various brands in sport sponsorship.
"It's the right time for us to move the brand bank, as (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the executive director.
It would be very interesting three years ago if we said we were going to be a remarkable bank for customers and close all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of our clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think it's time.
Franci Dettori comes to 3,000 winners winning in the Newmarket of Prastria
The children are breaking up the champagne after a double in New York City has won it to 3,000.
Joke Franki Dettory won his 3,000 British win in New York on Friday.
He came to this outstanding note with the help of his second winner at night on his way home, to the Pristrasti, taught by John Lord.
The 45-year-old Italian is a sixth-year-old who has reached this outstanding mark in the ice-cream.
He's followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Dugo Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pete Iddery and Willy Carson.
The three-time champion of the Ditttory, who had previously won Ghyyar, said, "That's something special."
I'm very comfortable because my family is here too.
I'm so glad this happened in New York, so I moved here 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a typical Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from a lot and very unsatisfied.
The children accept the appellant when the Presidency After the Victory
Two runners reached the same score in the race with obstacles: Richard Johnson's champion, and the 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4300 recorded careers.
Lester Piggott, Nineteenth Winner Derby, 4493 win in career
Franki is one of the best survivors of the modern era and is not surprised that he has reached the record that so many have reached.
He's strong and strong, but his tactical smile is different from that of others in the wedding room.
He was a great representative for the jump, his enthusiasm and passion attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a couple of weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if it wasn't just a few exits and big jumps!
And if it's serious, Franky has brought the winners in Britain for a total of 30 years to see.
He's an energetic person who's good for British jumps, but more than that, he's an incredible runner.
Franky Dettory released this exhilarating note of the company's passion for evil.
From intense to intense shocks, Franci Dettori is a symbol of British smooth jumps over two decades.
It was a flight and a fall.
Many of the survivors of the great leaps, including his so-called Great-Semerka in Ascot, in 1996, but he also survived the aviation disaster and experienced the disqualification of doping.
Three years ago, he began to face difficulties when he returned after six months of disability, but he showed tremendous willingness to push the challenges of sceptics and return to form.
And he may have not finished at some time, and the children said earlier that he would like to continue participating in funerals, at least until the age of 50.
Putin releases Sergei Ivanova's head of administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly killed his head of the administration of Sergei Ivanova.
Ivanov was part of a trusted neighborhood near Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed as a representative on environmental issues and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “has decided to release Ivanova from his duties as head of the Russian administration,” but did not mention the reason.
Mr. Ivanova's successor, Anton Wayne, has been appointed as his successor since 2012.
Mr. Wayne, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia in 1972, he completed the prestigious University of International Relations of Moscow (IMMO) and served in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the president's protocol and Government support, reporting on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
He said to Putin during his appointment, "Thank you for your faith."
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your work as Heads of State in the development of draft laws and the monitoring of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin informed a Russian televisionman on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from this position and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do they convince you?
It's a walk that left Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, has served in the Security Council, the KGB.
As the head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who showed on public television, two men said that the head of the administration had gone away on his own.
In spite of the camera's scarcity, however, this little person here was convinced — especially now — right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these unexpected consequences of any power struggle?
Until no one knows.
The official statement, however, was that a person who once acted as a potential president suddenly wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy was met with a huge scepticism.
In Putin's comments on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very difficult task, even if it could be said that the problem post was four years away.
Well, I've been the head of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov entered the post in December 2011.
He had previously worked as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as well as Mr. Putin.
By the end of 1990, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which had been replaced by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanova among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second time of Putin, and that the third time for Putin would contradict the Constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin served as Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency after three and a half years.
The star of the series "Think as a criminal" Thomas Gibbson released after the dragon with the transmitter.
Gibson was a member of the team's show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences of attitudes and opinions.
I regret that this has happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's personnel will be removed from the show, followed by the FBR agent team, is expected to be received later, in accordance with statements of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously played a major role in the Dharma and Greg's seat, was in the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "Think as a criminal" and put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there before the end, but now it's not possible.
I just want to thank the stagers, the promoters, the actors, our remarkable team, and, most importantly, the best worshipers who can only dream of the show.
It was noted that the show was returned with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Note: The fish are landed in the Bantfa garden
A man from Banfa called to help identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could be fish left dead by water.
Bane, a 500 - foot [500 m] seaman, released this plant in Periscop in hopes that someone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two-thirds of fish.
Quinsferri Crossing: The bridge is now united with Faif
The project of 1.35 billion pounds must now be completed by May 2017
Engineers joined the north wing and Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now united with Faif.
This is the first of the four interlocks between the windmills, which are now suitable for the completion of all three pillars of the bridge.
The Feif bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds should now be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economics, Kit Brown, has visited the area today and has been among the first to leave the country to the bridge.
He said: "It is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferri Crossing.
We have all witnessed engineering indeed at an epic level in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the mass size and weight of the bridge, the combination between the display and the bridge floor is a virtual operation using extremely precise permissions for the collection.
In total, about 79 per cent of the entire bridge floor is now in place, and for the last section, the concrete floor is now in Rosaite, which means that everything is ready to stand at the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first move on each bridge project is always a significant step.
This ongoing project represents the most modern building experience.
After the last section of the road was set up and connected with the expanding North Pole, we were left to close the remaining view on the north — or on the shore.
This was done by strengthening the northern approach to 700 millimetres south.
It was a massive operation at the same time.
The size, since a distance of 222 meters, is about 6000 tonnes and should have been raised to a angle of about 3 per cent.
Amazingly, the permissions on which the team worked were limited — a few millimetres per direction.
Luckily, it's all gone very well.
Rescue in the Moelfr River: Three Men 'Stored to Stay in Life' · Global Voices
Three men were forced to stay alive after they were expelled from the fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfres RNLI rescue station was worried at 13:20 on the British summer of Friday, after the command saw an event unfolding in the Moelfr River.
Three men outside the force tried to get to a safe place while their ship continued on its way.
"We saw how their ship circled around them and assumed they were worse," said the roulette rescuer Moelfres Vince Jones.
"Happyly, when we were down to the water, a strong wind brought it in for them," he added.
Two men were saved with the help of a local fishing vessel, and a third man 60 years old was found unable to fight without a shelter.
All of them were on board the ship of the rescue ship and were transported to the rescue station.
Johns said, "Three men thrown into the water have claimed that they are alive and totally innocent.
The ship's engine had an accident switch, but he somehow withdrew from the man who managed the boat when it crashed.
Someone protected these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy cure for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch how the world changes.
The fact that adults and children no longer go out the street to play, prefering to spend their free time on the screen, has been sad to many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go detonates people from the wild and engages in some physical activity.
The time was significantly limited by television, video, and recent smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I, of course, have a positive influence on Pokémon Go, an annex based on personnel originally created for video games in 1990 (after the birth of a series of multifilms, play cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural events, it all lost its relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then delayed due to a massive challenge that was overloaded by the server.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, games with smartphones are going to search for Pokemons that are tracking through GPS and, being discovered, can be "photografted" (through your phone screen) or "remembered".
The generation that played in the game, as a youth, joined in high-level involvement, leaving the demons to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of “normal” steps per day.
Cardiogram, an application for Apple Watch, which is followed by 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people who were monitored for 30 minutes each day has risen from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays in Pokémon Go, it just sees the original data on the transition.
Many health campaigns that convince people to find 30 minutes, to get up from the couch and to be active every day have not been answered, since most health messages are boring and people look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce the risk of development in their hands or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the Pokémon Go flight is that it draws people on the street to do what they like.
Thus, there are three health grounds: movement, fresh air and sunlight and happiness.
Some people even make new friends.
As usual, there's a bunch of demands that they're looking for to apologize.
And yes, someone can hit the door.
Well, what?
There's been a break.
Although the applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit, were able to track our physical activity earlier, they did not give us a reason for the way this game works.
The paper is ready, and use will slow down over time.
However, the success of Pokemon will result in more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and health.

Simon Bails wins the gold of absolute primacy in women's gymnasium
Forget about pressure.
Forget about the sum.
Simon Bayles is not vulnerable to all of this.
It's dynamic on a solid spring.
Not forced to go to the grave.
It's a sex joke.
It's driving in.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnasium was entitled to a campaign on absolute primacy in Thursday, placing a gap between itself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under the auspices of the Olympics.
Her general ball 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the Serbian medalist and company under the command of "Final Peterca" Eli Rysman and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafin.
Bayles from the United States is at the gymnasium at the end of the woman's individual absolute first-time artistic gymnasium at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails became the fourth American woman's team, winning the title of the champion of absolute sovereignty and the fifth, strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps when it did not.
She was shocked when she was shown her final general ball and her long trip was over.
This achievement puts it in the same league as that of extremely rare bats, such as Michael Felps, who have raised their own sports at new altitudes:
Bails spent the last three years, winning 15 medals of the world's champion, including 10 gold, with such glamorous programs in their mix of work and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called it "the greatest gym I've ever seen."
One last test took place in Brazil, not only between Bayles and the rest of the area, but also between it and the goods of the expected increase.
Something less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with the burning of gold medals would be considered an unfair expectation.
Simon Bails from the United States, the left, and Eli Rysman are buried after winning gold and silver, respectively, at the end of the woman's individual absolute first-time artistic drama at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August 2016.
Bails worked for the first gold on Tuesday, and became a beautiful final deal for the late evening of the coordinator of the national collection, Martha Caroli.
While Bills insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not all.
Part of her free exercise program — which includes her business tour — was set up in Latin American music, which would come as a home on the street just outside of the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was impressed by her grandmother and grandmother, who was beginning to walk with the child and discovering the mother of Coach Amy Burman during a visit to the room where Burman was a trainer, became strong.
It has not missed any summit on the absolute beginning since 2013 — the stage of the journey, which must continue as long as Bayles wants.
Although Mustafin had a small advantage with two awards, it was a dream.
The gymnasiums and free exercise, where Bayls defends the name of a champion of peace, are on the ground.
She went up again with 15,433 in the red and ended with 15,933 in the field.
Raisman had a soft eye on her until they waited for a final account — a clean formality — and the tears appeared around the bright blue and blue eye of Bayles, when he imagined that she had ever written in the album for the release.
Raisman's statement was a small place four years ago when it was a third place but lost the bridge of Mustafa on the Thabrake.
This time the 22-year-old captain of a team called the U.S. bomb was much ahead.
She sent the whole crowd back after her free exercise, with a return that was sometimes mentioned in the question.
With regard to Bayles, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week is now completely new:
Police: 3 victims in the case of a serial killer shot in the hearing of music in the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls who died during the most deadly attack in the case of the first serial killer of Finix in the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published in Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lyner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Mali, were shot on June 12, when their car was parked on the passageway, the authorities said.
The offender made about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, after turning on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that the three killings are not likely to be the result of theft, since the offender did not take a check or $2,900 that had been ordered by one of the adult victims.
The representative of the Fínx police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that he had been shot to see if he was related to four previous attacks.
All seven people were killed and two others injured by nine attacks in two highly Latin American areas for four months.
"It's happening in the living area before home," said Howard KPHO, CBS at the beginning of this month.
The suspected use of several vehicles, including the 'Nissan', 'Nissan', 'Nissan', ' black BMW ' s '90s ' and ' Cadillac' or 'Lincoln' was suspected.
The followers refused to reveal evidence that the attacks were linked to one another and committed to the same killer.
Ellis, in 33 C.E., had been hospitalized with wounds and had ended later.
Liner, aged 31, and daughter Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities have also published a report on the shooting, which was intended to be an empty pickup for three hours before the murder and which, as they believe, was the case of a serial killer.
The followers found the gils and pulled the ball out of the seat and the poles out of the motorbike.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with a microcephalus: "It's gonna be better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixevito likes drinking, toys, and, of course, his mother.
However, unlike most of his peers, Edmonda had a genetic disorder that his mother did not know about when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was, ‘ I can’t do this. ’
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
In fact, it's not true that you're signing up for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent said that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical institution.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were still doing that," explained Pixivto.
Edmund's on his way with the hoduns.
Edmund didn't sit down and he didn't get it until he got three, and he doesn't even speak.
But he slowly passes through some stages.
He's on the sidewalk and he's riding on a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and drinking.
Elizabeth shows the passion that Edmund had in mind for "Please join me."
"We learn his language of cruelty," said the Pixic CBS News.
But it is not just the common language of harshness — she says that Edmund has chosen his own tempers.
Microcephalia may result in a number of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmunda, infections during pregnancy, such as cancer and Zika.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about what it says about the lives of those infected by the Zika virus.
The Pixic recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I've always said what's going to happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't actually ask for a whole lifetime forecast, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for the mother of children with inherited defects due to Zika.
It'll get better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Strong rain, flood of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to announce the emergency on Friday, with even more cuts expected to fall on the state by Saturday, including.
Several rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the South Mississippi have emerged from the shores and are threatened with extensive flooding following extreme droughts, reported the National Meteorological Service.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bell Edwards, said that public officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already been provided to the injured persons.
Mike Steel, representative of the Governor ' s Office for National Security and Emergency Response, said that there were requests for high water transport, boat and sand masks.
Styl said only Tangjipaho's arrival asked for tens of thousands of bags with sand.
The risk of flooding remains high until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The meteo-service stated that additional 3-5 debts could be raised in the area.
In southern Alabama, the water cycle lasted until Friday, as the rains continued to go on in the area of Mobila.
The Committee's River with Baton-Russia and the Emitt River with Dene Springs, both in Louisiana, had to set a record level of return in the past.
Synoptic Alex Krautmann said that both rivers could accommodate many homes in neighboring areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the floods coming down to Assen's entrance were a threat, as those rising rivers would slowly penetrate the Morp Lake.
The Tikfo River, almost south of the Mississippi state of Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers have still forced people out of water in the areas of Emmitt and Wilkinson in the southwestern part of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his passengers were among those who had been saved earlier on Friday at Gloucester's train.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the waters of Bever Crick, which are usually more than 400 feet [400 feet] away from his home, are rapidly rising by night.
He said that another passenger who lives near him warned him.
"We were tired, and the water continued to follow," said Hansford.
She's reached the level of my poem.
His wife told Hansford that it was the greatest attraction she'd seen for 48 years, living here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he was the only one able to swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three with the help of an army truck and brought them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautman says that the flood is “fastly spread” as the rains continue, noting that the officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautman says that one observer on the streets of Livingstone reported a 13.75 drop of rain from Monday to Friday morning.
Krautman said that the soil was overgrown with raindrops from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the street led to the rescue of residents from home in Tangjipahho and the removal of jobs in five school districts, the authorities said.
WWL, the CBS branch, reports that the Tangjipaho Council had reported 200 burned houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but now they are both burned.
The incoming President, Mr. Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The receptions were opened in the city of Emita and the city of Hammond to accept those who had been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water begins to disappear," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the entrance of Tangjipahhoa, about two dozen roads were closed from high water level, and sand masks were available to give people hope that they would keep water away from houses and businesses.
"The last great flood that we had in March," said urban manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on the way to a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison, director of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey reported that the heavy rain continued to come along the Mexican river.
According to him, several houses were registered as buried on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, director of the Shopper Value Foods store in Emita, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I saw water in places where I had never seen it before," said Tausson, and she still flew to the ground."
Mahaz Brown, 6, "solved with bullets", remains alive after the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that in Philadelphia, a 6-year-old boy was shot by a second shooting in a 6-year-old town this week.
The grandmother and the grandchild knew him for CBS Philadelphia like Mahage Brown.
The grandmother and grandmother are talking, Brown has received numerous fire wounds, including his dog, leg, hand and life, but he was aware when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He got very well, his little body was cut off by bullets," said his grandmother Delores Mellendez at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition and had several operations.
The family told the station that it was expected to be repaired.
He had to go to the first class at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men was critical; two other victims were registered in a stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shooting at the front seat of the vehicle in critical condition with 29 years of age, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be shot.
Follow-up reports to the CBS Philadelphia that apparently there was a shooting among several armed people.
The semi-automatic weapons hijacked by various semi-automatic weapons specimens have stopped the operation.
It seems that this was definitely a prolonged battle.
There were hills on the street, on both sides of the triangle.
Therefore, there were a number of armed fighters there, and they were actively involved in the shooting," reported the police captain of the Philadelphia police station Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in this area were also occupied.
No arrests have been made, and the police, reports, are watching video surveillance cameras.
Another six-year-old girl was shot in the arm of a shell ball Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's coming back, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby, and Laurie
That's what I call a woman's Olympic Games for this year and for several reasons.
First, I have been on every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasiums in this collection: Simon Bails, Gabby Douglas and Laurent "Loury" Ernades, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this collection, complemented by Eli Raisman, who is a Jew, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
It looks like America at the end.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, the number of women's gymnasiums has been one of the Americans.
Last year Simon and Gabby were No.1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
In the past Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
The world could now be a witness to the three-time champions of the Mira Simona Bailes, Douglas and Laurie Ernandes, who perform unexpected but yet virtuative gymnasiums.
In the fourth quarter of Simon became the fourth American gold prize winner in a woman's individual absolute empire.
And a college colleague named Eli Rysman worked hard.
We're going to be witnesses of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look that way in the gymnasiums all over the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie have all chosen the same route as Eli and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They are "final Friday", because the next Olympic Gymnastics collection will have only four gymnasiums in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroly's training.
In reality, though, it is a good sport, and beginners are trained in private gym clubs that are supported by parents who pay the cost of learning, training, travel, form, participation in funerals, hotel services (for coaches and their gyms and families), and the list continues.
Most of these Gymnasty clubs are located in the wealth-intensive areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where the gymnasiums receive all their training, and this is a road and long-term responsibility for the gymnasiums.
Amy Burman, coach Simon Bails, and Maggie Hani, coach Laurie Ernandes, both trained their athletes from the time they took up the gym.
We must create a more cost-effective and accessible learning of the gymnasiums of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gym fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and cheap gymnasiums in Garlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin Americans) and have raised national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide a high-quality youth gymnasium that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
The chemistry develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the sustainability of the external work, discipline and sustainability of the mind.
This combination has a positive impact on good health, success in school and work throughout life.
That's what it's like to encourage thousands of girls to take a gymnasium, and that's great.
Sports is so important, especially for a girl.
Now is such a remarkable time.
Thank you, Simon, Eli, Larry, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in the victory of the commandal Olympic gold and for encouraging so many girls from different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Young doctors have taken further arrests after Jeremy Hunta's proposal was rejected
The Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on the change by agreeing with the amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37 000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt developed plans to enter the treaty, saying that NHS was on the ground and any subsequent delay would damage personnel and patients.
The first young doctors are transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in working hours during the night and emerging to improve out-of-time care.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of the Young Doctors" BMA, said yesterday in a statement: "There are still serious concerns about the proposed treaty, particularly that he is questioning the current crisis of labour force and that he cannot apply to all doctors in a fair manner."
There has been eight weeks before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, necessary progress and time of departure.
The WMA's attempt to allow negotiations was met with a lack of willingness to take action and sometimes with full silence from the Government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hantu needs to act now, encourage introduction and respond to the fears of young doctors.
If he does not do so, young doctors will not reason that they are willing to organize subsequent exercises.
The last stop at the end of April drew a delay of approximately 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 medics, while nurses and consultants were involved in the replacement of doctors on the pictorial line.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute on change by agreeing with the revised treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants to pay better for 44,000 young doctors who will be subject to the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employees, called on young doctors not to continue to smoke.
Mortimer stated: "The traumas achieve a little or nothing, but pressure on those who are already working on teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and anxiety to patients, seats and their families."
Over the past two months, we have talked to the Committee of Young Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and Others, positively responded to their concerns about the role of care and corporate information policy.
It was hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning to post-training, the cost of training, mutual recognition of the educational plan, academic leave and gender differences in pay for work in medicine, were the evidence that the health education of England and the Department of Health had met with the conditions reached by WMA in November, February and May.
Preparation for 2 £ a day can reduce the risk of heart failure
Thousands of patients with a heart attack will be using 2 £ per day, after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and for a longer period of time.
The counter-responsive preparation of thagrelor reduces the risk of repeated access to people with heart disease.
The preparation is already scheduled for 12 months after heart failure, reducing the risk of insulin or new injection.
The NICE National Health Service of Great Britain has recommended that its people be at risk for four years in order to continue to avoid the risk of cardiac and co-existence.
However, the NICE National Health Service of Great Britain has now advised its people for four years to keep out of the risk of heart-cooperative problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140,000 people in England each year, and four of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of living material at the arterial walls and the formation of a bottle.
If it is broken down, this may be the cause of a thrombosis that inhibits the access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the tromb moves, it can move through the flow of blood and block the bleeding into the brain, causing the insulin.
People who have already taken one approach are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name of Brilique reduces the risk of being compromised.
The NICE instruction project, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of tacgrel for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective methods of secondary prevention, about four people already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating effects.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that tacits, in combination with aspirin, are effective in reducing the risk of follow-up heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In advance, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of the tiger is limited — especially the risk of bleeding — after three years — the draft instructions do not recommend treatment for that period.
The culture of the PC government allows for the falsification of the vote in Muslim areas
Ex-Mer Tauer Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, serving the Government's interpretation of the report
The culture of political adjustment has led to the closing of the eye, which has turned the overall falsification of the vote in Muslim communities, from the devastating report of the Government today.
Former member of the Prime Minister's office, Sir Eric Pictz, was critical of the police, electoral observers and city administration for ignoring the evidence of violations of the elections because of the “expression of racial identity and religion”.
The former Secretary of the local community, now an anti-corruption king, reported that the threat of voters on the religious ground was so strong that the police had to allow the corridors to be placed outside the electoral districts to protect the vulnerable voters.
He suggests that the voters take personal evidence to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, the voters must only specify their name and address.
The report even proposes to place unsolicited blacks on the hands of people when they deliver their ballots in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to the informants, Sir Erik said.
It calls for greater access to the documents of the local council and decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against electoral fraud but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes from it," he said.
The report was ordered by The Dayn Street following the vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Court on Elections decided that Mr. Luftur Rahman should be removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “scinically expressed” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and stopped shutting down his criticisms by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rakhman, as it was said, “he had a campaign based on the responsibility of the Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questioned, or were the result of the staffing, when the person was voting, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concerns about fraud by voting in a post in which the senior members of the Muslim community, as reported, pressured the people to vote for their elected candidate.
Sir Eric, on the photo, made a number of recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including the requirement to provide his identity certificate to prove who you are.
His report stated: “The evidence of the pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, was presented to vote in favour of older people, especially in the Pakistan and Bangladesh communities.
“There was a fear that... the public institutions were blind to such conduct because of the excessive sense of “political justice” regarding ethnicity and religion.
Sir Erik gave 50 recommendations on cleaning up the system, including the removal of political activists from work with postal ballots to stop the "scrambling of votes".
The report also calls for thorough checks on registration to prevent the use of the list of voters for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option is considered to require voters to provide evidence of identity before the vote.
Use unbridled blacks on people's fingers, as long as they're throwing their ballots to mix someone's vote twice.
To conduct systematic checks on the nationality of people in order to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limit on requests for an automatic mail vote.
Eliminate political actors and activists from work with completed ballots and post-vote conversions.
The authority of the police to establish the codes of the electoral districts.
Amendment of the Act to facilitate the prosecution of people in fear under the 1983 People ' s Act.
Take illegal photographs at the electoral sites.
To require only English to be used in electoral locations (with the exception of Wales).
Enforce training to ensure that staff are able to go to one place after another.
Sir Eric was furiously attacked by the city police, saying that it was "precious" that no criminal charges had been filed after the Tauer Hamlets case.
“The Court of Justice, which dealt with the issue of elections, disqualified Lutforura Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal actions”, he reported.
He was convicted of a number of grounds in the absence of a reasoned argument — a criminal standard of evidence.
It also criticises the unsolicited “circuit checks” of electoral offices of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The previous ruling of the court in Tuuer Hamletse was a signal of excitement.
Our nation has a high heritage as a mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the worrying and secret distribution of electoral fraud and the denial of some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Similar wisdom to Kate's bike similar to other Olympics in Rio
The 2016 Olympics in Rio this week came with the wisdom of the French driver Polin Ferran-Prevo, who seemed to be impressively like the Cambridge Hercogene.
But the 24-year-old Olympic player is not the only sportsman fighting for gold this summer, which can be admired by his own famous double — at least by the news in the series.
Thus, in the honour of Game Rio and all the prominent people on our screens at the moment, F.J. has compiled a list of Olympics with more than a surface match with the Hollywood stars.
Oxotnik and Volk: U.S. male team member Brady Ellison, left, compared with Leonardo DiCaprio at the time he was a child
In addition to Kate's bike driver, many people have been able to show online how a certain trailer could be a neighbor of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
A member of the U.S. male team of volunteers, Brady Ellison, became the cause of hurricanes in Twitter after the images appeared that looked like the star of Volca and Wallstree.
And in fact, the hunter learned of the stupidity of the cubs and admitted that he heard that he was like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a great outcome, maybe except for face growth," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
In one of the most popular comparisons in London 2012, it will undoubtedly show even more this year: the striking similarity between the British nobleman Greg Deserford and the popular actor Nilo Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnasium, Aliya Mustafin, with its great expressive eyes, is a precise copy of the Cuban-American tale of Gloria Estefan.
And in the base of South Africa, Cameron Van der Burga has been compared to the Star of Man Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving to the more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is a sports version of the "Start" actor
Another long-standing comparison was between the Tennisist Raphael Nadar and actor Joshua Harnett, who could be caught with similar heavy loads and losses.
The Serbian medalist flyer from Russia, Julia Efimova, can be praised not only with the same hot skin and bright hair as Annalin McCord's actress, but also with Nathan Adrian from the US team, as fans say, like "the sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
Surviving women: The Hoop Solo Star, the left, and Jennifer Carpenter's actress from Dexter, in fact, have the same faces and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the results
Creation theory: According to this user, there may be a reason that this pair is similar to the outside
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to find out that "the real Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are identical."
In fact, U.S. football stars and Dexter actresses have incredibly similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her uncle, who is close to the identity of the actress Lori Linni, as well as the winning gold medal of Gabby Douglas, who can admire its own beautiful wide smile, which looks like the "Doby Success" star of Gabriel Union.
Olimpiad's comment on the CBC is sorry for saying about the Chinese dead as a pig.
Analysis Byron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14th-year-old Yianhanh on the female estaphite free-style 4x200 m in the middle of the CBC vision in the direct crossing of the Olympics
The Canadian intelligence company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that 14-year-old Chinese hunters "started like a fire" and "dead as a pig" during the flood.
Commenter Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female sceptat 4x200 m free-style.
It could be heard as McDonald, who was led by CBC commentators to "relief her colour," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese has wiped out a sword, child."
Too popular, she started out like a fire, she died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China's 14-year-old Ai Janhan, who had experienced the second stage of estaphitis at 1:57.79 — in 1.61 seconds less than Canadian Taylor Rock, allowed the Canadians to remove their departure from China.
Observers throughout Canada responded quickly to the network after it was hit by the tone and the expression used
Emmet McFarlyen tweeted: "Is the fact that dictator CBC just said that 14-year-olds from China died as a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize that they were still in hell."
About Ai Janjanh from China at the end of a woman's estaphet, 4x200 m free-style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has wiped out a sword, child."
Critics in Twitter quickly broke down on Biron McDonald, and many called for him to be killed.
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how uncomfortable Biron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: "Nothing but #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a racist bitch. #disgusted.
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who received the CBC transfer, apologized to the immediate ephere after the Macedonian comment, saying: "We are sorry that the comment on the ephere was made on the ephere."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
The SVC has concluded that more than 90 people have apologized in response to this statement
A friend of Scott Russell's commentator came to make excuses from McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologys to more than 90 other Twitter users, who appealed to Macedonia's comments.
The television has also made it easier to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to enter the Efération.
Last night, we were working on an operation to apologize in front of our viewers in a direct ephere and our signatures in the camps.
It was clear that Bahrain's comments referred to the expression of a thief rather than to a person.
However, it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Bajron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized in a direct ephere and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think that his words were interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to use the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the woman's estabette," he said on the transition of the Olympic Games to CBC.
"I spoke about the expression of a thief, not about him personally."
'I'm sorry I didn't understand any disrespect, I'm sorry.'
Buyer Primark offended a woman who had repeatedly shown a lower white in the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look when a woman was forced to wear a shirt, as well as with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she saw how she looked, stood them, and put them back on her knees.
She continued her search and eventually died four pairs of low-whites in a shop at Bouverie Place Trade Center in Folkston.
Primark Trade Center Bouverie Place in Folkstone, where a woman used to wear triangles, before she put them back on the floor
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the example of the lower white forgett woman again, "she went out of the store and bought nothing."
She said, “The people did not believe in what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the shopping room, she took a couple of trucks out of the kitchen, took off her own shoes, and pulled them out.
"She didn't try to find a beautiful place to do it, she just stood there, unharmed."
"They were all stopped when she took off her shirt again, and they obviously didn't like it because she put them back on the floor."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she would like, she would go out and go.
"It doesn't look like she's lost someone watching her, or that she's thinking about the man she's buying the pipes she's been looking for."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "It's against the idea that someone is going to take a house trip that someone else has already carried, and they're not being watched."
The event took place on Tuesday.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff, of course, tried to remove these items from the sale after she left, well, that's better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of women's bags and find out that another woman had taken them and they weren't taken care of."
The representative of Primark reported: "Primark knows about the events that took place in our store in Falkland on Tuesday, 9 August".
All the goods on which the matter was concerned were removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself from assaults with a gun using a bow
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help you to make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mirzrachi, the headmaster of the Federation of Crabs in New York to find out how to deal with armed recruits in close proximity.
Whether they come before you or behind you, this video will show you how to kill a prisoner with his own weapons.
If they fit back, as Mizarach said, the first thing you need to do is to spread out so that you can see the attacker and ‘ free the line of fire’.
Then you draw a gun between your front and your back before you hit them in the face of a free lock.
Then it shall be blown into the dust, and as soon as the wound breaks out, ye shall draw out the gun from his hand, and ye shall strike it in the face, and ye shall go back and forth, and ye shall hold the weapons upon it.
For an armed attacker, the way to execute the like is to get your body out of the fire, quickly catch the gun and shoot it so that the criminals can't shoot.
At the same time, move on to the gun, and hit the attacker into the chest, then pull the gun out of his pocket, before you go back and aim at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how Mirrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery, if you don't have a blood master, is to give your own.
Traveller Jan Reit is conducting his language in the most remote parts of Europe
The British passenger has been subjected to his immune system and a reflux of serious testing by limiting some of the most terrible and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead author and author of the book of travel, Jan Reitt, 51, from Safffolk, conducted a language on the euro bank, the Kirk Piccadili pearl, the button is playing on a trip and a Russian public telephone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before moving each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going on.
But the experiment to be a film called "Lesun's Guide to the Interior" gave some surprising results.
In fact, there are even worse bacteria in the kitchen cancer.
During the entire trip to Europe, Reit spoke to doctors and workers about the increase in oxygen bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing made him more than a bad taste in the flesh.
Rayt became aware of the trials of his nephew’s strength, traveling through the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public bells to the unicorn button, this task must have tested its immune system.
In a film he filmed, he said, "From childhood, I was completely concerned about my health, and I drew a lot of different things from the ground, eating red and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the Russian public toilet.
His test brain demonstrated the value of a lumminometer greater than 4,000 units.
For comparison: only the hand-drawn should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to bend, after its lumminometer was more than 4,000 units, while only the stretched hands showed less than 60.
Rait and the Finnish dairy producer Valio filmd a travel film called "Lesun Road Guide on the Internal Force", showing the number of bacteria in various places, for example in the toilet
He said, "It's near one of the worst things I've ever seen in the toilet."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to put anything on, because it's awful.
The "Lesun Road Guide on the Internal Force" was removed together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human oxygen bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice-President Valio on breakfast, juices and new categories, Niko Vourenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time might explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended the idea of "Let's call Jan."
They claim that the health of the bottle becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to place them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the oxygen health and how it is related to the immune system.
A growing interest in the health of the bottle is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information on it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was film director, added: 'Let's say that I'd lose respect for Jana if he'd wrapped up some of the things I asked for, for example, a disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easy to swallow, and some were hard enough.
I'm glad some of these changes have made us sleep on the plane.
In a 2015 study conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents associated oxymololic bacteria exclusively with the good condition of the refrigerator and the kitchen, and 58 per cent said that they used, at least occasionally, products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The family of Hilguns destroyed Saltsa, the municipal home of Cornuol, forced exile
The family left their municipal home with $50,000 lost after they were raised to threaten their neighbors.
Tanu Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, were expelled from their estate in Salta, Cornelius, after a long list of complaints against them.
Since they were forced to move out of the mobility facility, the shocks of housing and construction cooperatives revealed that the facility was in a condition which required repair.
The walls were left with swirling walls, half were closed, the wall was split apart on the ground, and the walls were packed with graphite.
The family is now moving and is expected to live in a private room
Donna McEvoy, a resident in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he wouldn't survive.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There is much to be done, because this object will probably be known as not a very good aspect of Cornelius.
This family is used in a foolish way, and their name is used in a foolish way.
A couple of three children living in a time of instability, and the police report that the kingdom of terror caused by the family included streets with baseball bats, the threat of the inhabitants of nearby areas, the use of drugs, drug trafficking, excessive crises, disputes and abuses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for antisocial conduct in June.
In several rooms of a house that may have been broken down, they found an old mouse
A house where drugs were sold in the past was destroyed
Neighbors say they saw drugs on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after the extended period was extended to 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The relief visit was welcomed by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into ad.
One reported, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here, it's amazing.
'That morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we didn't get used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Housing, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years with the police and regularly called the police.
Moses and the old toys were broken down on the edge of the municipal house
He added: 'It is a suggestion that the lessor could not take any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, such as the expulsion, is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing looks at.
This was a very difficult case, as conduct was limited, and their actions must have been terrible for her neighbours.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and the members of Devon and Cornual community have done to provide us with information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that social behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived at home at different times, but he said they were all a little more than 20.
Bad matrix left on the floor in one of the burning houses after the removal
Population workers will now have to remove the chests of the mouse that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 cents of fuel, as well as supplies and $1,700 of supplies.
Skeldon was excommunicated after he recognized himself guilty of drug abuse in Class B for the purpose of delivery.
She said that money went to pay for the funeral for her son, Li Skeledon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After making them homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plimute.
The walls of many rooms in the house were packed with plotters all over the surface.
The police say they will try to remove tenants who do not comply with rent rules.
Angela Crou, from Devona and Cornual, stated that this visit had clearly warned other contractors who continued to violate the rules.
"This is a message for those who feel that they can bear their own burdens without blame, and for those who do wrong," she said.
Crime and antisocial behavior will never be allowed by Devona and Cornual police, who will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came in fear when a flying military plane had barely washed the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to swim on the sun were terrified of their lives
Aeroplane P-3C Orion, Portugal's Air Force Air Force, was incredibly low
Military air forces reported that they had carried out a training flight but were at risk of safety
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start panicking, when the lower-fly plane crashed over the overloaded beach.
A military plane flying almost not far from the docks in the sandy area of Aveiro, northern Portugal, has been seen on the dramatic frames.
The breathers jumped on their feet as they were only for the obvious reasons you were worried about aircraft drivers, but they had no chance to see that they were moving through the clouds.
An incident happened last night near the city of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernance, one of the few breathers who published a video of a shocking passage in social networks, said: "He flew at least two times, and it was a moment, at some point, it was shown to be broken."
Nuno Arrogja added, "I was busy with surfing, and I swear, it was a feeling that an airship fell on me."
Travelers on the Aveiro beach were terrified when the plane showed off the plane and flew to an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force has said today that the P-3C Orion aircraft has completed a training flight to detect fishing vessels on the coast and has been forced to land so low as it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot said that the aircraft had flew a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by the smoke from nearby tropical forests, but the military-air forces claimed that no one was at risk.
By this summer, forest fires had damaged the motherland of Portugal, and four people had been killed on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's military air forces have made a statement today that the pilot has come to fly so low under conditions — a heavy fire and power from forest fires that have weakened visibility
The pilot had been trained by Samuel, and the pilot had been ordered to find fishing boats in the context of the task
The HASSP system has been mandatory for general research for more than a year, but most of the coffee and restaurants of Petersburg have not yet entered it.
Checks are becoming more active, and business is putting a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
Over the years, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of the HASCP) has been responsible for the analysis of risks and critical control points, as well as for the use of food producers and carriers, as well as companies in the field of public education in Russia, such as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
Business checks by the Rosspore Supervision in accordance with these rules in Petersburg began in February 2015.
However, as long as the officials record the fines only for certain infringements of the regulation (see "List of documents").
In general, the non-compliance of the regulation involves 600 thousand rubles for the first infringement and 1 million rubles for the second.
The HASCP as a system that takes into account the risks of food and prevention in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about food security for the astronauts.
The system is now being used for all food businesses not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the Eurojust.
Since February 2015, the HASCP has been operating on the TC territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years old (HASCP demand was reflected in the TS TS regime in 2011).
However, entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule applies only to food products, not to restaurants, to the head of the General Council, Elena Curetelli.
Now everyone's trying to get lost.
The expected period for the renewal of the charismatic voyages in Turkey - the end of August - began September.
But they do not challenge food demand, as their target audience - families with children - are already ready for school, and experts note.
The Alliance of Tourist Agencies sent a letter to the Government yesterday, asking that the charter be allowed.
“For many Russian tourists, the issue of quality and access to sea air is unacceptable, as most of the facilities of accommodation are already blocked by the end of September” the authors note and stress that the opening of the freight transport in August does not have a significant impact on the question of the Russian maritime product.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Federation of Tourism (RST), if the Russian and Turkish aviation agencies are rapidly agreed, the renewal of the charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of the time when the tickets will be renewed until they are gone will depend primarily on the aviation authorities.
They can technically fly in September, even August, if turopers operationally set up programmes and agree with the airlines on ships needed," says Paul Rumyancev, Deputy Communications Director and International Projects of the North-West RST Regional Office.
According to him, it is possible that the renewal of chaplains is good news, but does not have too much impact on the market, since the main buyers of the catacombs - families with children - have already returned from breathing and ready for school or vacations in other countries.
In the barhoat season, tourists and couples are bought mainly by tourists.
Chartering programmes can count on those who have the opportunity to breathe spontaneously," says Paul Romans.
"There is a chance in Turkey to attract many tourists, if she now has a very budget proposal - 50-60 thousand rubles for two, because there are people who are looking forward to a very decent tour," says Valeria Rosental, Director General of Optio-Travel.
In another case, it is not precisely a major volume of travel that has already been planned.
Paul Romance also believes that since there is a demand for regular trains in Turkey, tents will also be loaded, but there is no need to wait.
"To Turkey, the start of teasing is now a rehearsal of the next season," says Paul Romans.
"The opening of tents in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," according to Valeria Rubzov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NDFL from the legislation of compensation payments within the limits of approved rules relating to the reimbursement of injury caused by education or other health damage.
For workers employed under the conditions of employment, milk is provided for by section 222 of the RCF.
At the same time, the rules and conditions of issue are laid down by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Justice of 16.02.2009 No. 45.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent food products is made by workers on the day of actual employment at work with the conditions of work resulting from the presence of harmful production factors at work.
In accordance with those rules, the Russian Federation concluded in its letter that, on the basis of paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 of paragraph 2, the NKR is exempt from the provisions of the NDFF from income from the value of milk paid to workers on the day of actual employment in working conditions in accordance with Norma and the conditions approved by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 16.02.2009 No. 45.
The Moscow Gastroybank remains unlicensed by the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia refused a licence to perform banking operations in a credit organization of the Gaza Strip Commercial Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, ACO " GASPROYBANK" conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the provision of money in low-quality assets.
The adequate assessment of the risks taken by the supervisory authority and the credible reflection of the value of the bank's assets have led to the establishment of a framework for the implementation of banking prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration for the period of action until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
ACO "GASTROYBANK" is a member of the contribution insurance system.
We remember that the payment of insurance to banknoters, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ, "To ensure the contribution of natural persons to the Russian Federation banks" is made up of 100 per cent of the remaining funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubs in total.
Payments, according to the Insurance Agency, shall be effected no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, the amount of AO AKB "GASTROYBANK" assets on 1 August 2016 represented 335 positions in the IMF banking system.
London school, which joined IGIL, died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of three British students who left London last year to join IGIL, is reported to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akonji stated that her family had learned about her death in Rakek, Syria a few weeks ago.
It is estimated that it has lost its share of the Russian air strike in Rakk, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died as soon as she was planning to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this - as a funeral and an announcement to others, is that it is the risks that are involved in the journey to the military area of action - to persuade people to make the same choice at any time," Akonji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other students from eastern London landed on a plane in Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family told Sultan that she had married an IGIL warrior in Syria and had been widow for several months.
Reid states that Clinton will remain loyal to the Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of elections
The leader of the Democrats in Senator Harry Reid said he was convinced that a democratic candidate in President Hillary Clinton would appoint Judge Merrik Garland to the Supreme Court if he was elected as President.
The people of the Senate blocked the approval of Garland, but as President Barak Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said that the next president would elect the person who would be able to replace the final judge of the Supreme Court of Antonina Scalia.
Reid said at the Fourth Call Conference, he predicted that Clinton would choose the Garland "with some degree of confidence".
The representative of Reid said later that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to take the Garland away, and she just built the assumption.
He commended Harland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "float the boat" with a new election.
Garland, Chief Justice of the United States Appeals Court of Colombia.
Reid stated that the Republicans who block the appointment of the Garland are the "primary" and "capacitators" of the Republican candidate in the presidential presidential Donald Trampa.
He said Tramp wasn't suitable for the post.
Treats states that horotic calendars for "women as well as men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellmer to release in the light of the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
However, rather than undermining, they are aimed at finding the next generation of fuel models for their calendar for 2017 with dedicated museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, with a large number of charged models, is different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because Playboy is for men.
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is also.
“We need to return to the exhibition of a permanent and classic torture figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the woman’s body,” said Shaw in the press release on the calendar.
Women would like to be part of this project because it is an excellent art production.
Models can be given online or personally on open casinos in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be reminiscent of ill-informed internet stores.
In Moscow, a memorial will be issued that will tell you how to avoid becoming a victim of the Internet store.
That's what was reported in the Rospobnadsor, M24.
It is reported that departmental experts are preparing a memory that will help citizens to properly choose the Internet and identify possible mouse patterns.
The concept of this brochure contains several sections.
This will be a common knowledge and a legal basis, the rules of delivery of goods, the means of protecting their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make the claim correctly and so on."
The memory is currently being prepared.
It will then be placed on the Rospoebnador website in Moscow, and it is also planned to release a print version and distribute it to the Mosques.
The IMD of Russia issued a statement calling for the name of the second suspect in the organization of the dispersion in Crimea.
A number of Ukrainian and Russian citizens have been detained to assist in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Mr. Evgeny Aleksandrovich and Mr. Andrey Romanovic.
“They all give thanks,” the report says.
Former residents of the Zapora area, Evgeni Panov, who had been detained for suspicion in the organization of the tractors in Crimea, admitted his guilt for questioning.
The FAS is extracting Google at 438 million rubles.
The Russian Anti-Fraud Office (FAS) has appointed an administrative fine to the Google corporation of 438 million rubs, which is on the website of the Board.
"The amount of damage to Google's company for the violation of anatomical legislation was 438 million rubs.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay taxes in the near future," said FAS Deputy Director Alexei Dozenko.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google would place smartphones that were sold in the territory of Russia only if the Google Play applications were installed on the device and other corporate applications.
Among these applications is the search system to be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
As a result, the corporation violates p. 1 p. 10 of the FZ "O for the protection of competition" (deployment of the dominant position).
We are confident that compliance with the requirement will provide an opportunity for the development of competition on the market in the mobile PPO in Russia, which is welcome to our consumers.
The Law on the Protection of Competition requires compliance with all companies that are produced in the territory of the Russian Federation and with transnational corporations, including, " - the head of the Office for Communications Control and Information Technologies of the Russian Federation of Elena Zaeva.
The House suspects 16 Russian stores.
The "New Book" network came up for the sale of the book "50 days before my suicide."
The new bookstore network is described as selling the book Stace Kramer 50 days before my suicide, reports the city news agency Moscow.
As reported in the Rospobardsorge, without an explanation of the amount of fines, the text can be considered as “promotional or motivational behaviour of children and adolescents”.
The remaining District Court confirmed the violation of the requirements for the dissemination of information products among children and decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of the printed product arrested by the Rospotrabnadsor.
The source of the New Book confirmed that this was about Stes Kramer production.
In March of that year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores carried out checks on the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide".
The night in Moscow will be remembered by Ernesta Unknown.
In Moscow, night will be remembered by the sculptor Ernesta Unknown, TASS reports.
The event will be held on 15 August in the Central Library.
Unfortunately, not all of us are able to get along with the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided to set up this evening for those who wanted to replace it on their own land," they announced in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It was noted that this was important for the wife of Sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
The evening was invited by close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Evgeny Eutushenko, artist Boris Messerer, president of the GMII. Pushkina Irina Antonova, director Mark Rozovski, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinski, head of the Culture Department of Moscow, Alexander Kibovski, Vice-President of Moscow Leonid Pečatnikov.
It was previously reported that Ernesta's relatives were planning to take up a school curriculum in New York, which was supposed to be on 14 August.
The final consumer confessed: Who actually buys plastics?
The only men in the middle of the year love wine.
And until you've failed to break the section of the comments of the serious abuses under the pseudonyms of the Middle East, this approval is derived from the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the plastic rebirth is caused by not a bomb among the generation of two-months who want to find a new material object but a medium-year darkness.
Those who recently bought a wine album c for a large amount of probability are from 45 to 54 years of age, according to the data.
Moreover, those belonging to the age group are at least likely.
This is also not just an act of the collection of lovers - it is of emotional significance that older buyers are more likely to maintain their feelings (56 per cent against 53 per cent) and enjoy unity (69 per cent against 66 per cent).
But are the results youGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I'd go to the center of the live street of Soho, in a humble dress and a fierce squire before the stop, holding hands and saying something inside, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and grips — clothes, coffee, papercase stores have now filled the buildings, when independent sellers are involved, a few musical shops with fantastic specialists are still left.
I would probably have asked the camera to stay for the next stage, where I would be close to different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional tendencies through observation.
I went from Sister Ray, 55 years old, to Reckless Records, to eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old, in London, to hold a meeting on Sunday, and spend several hours on shops.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plastics.
These plastics that are shown above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't chase him home), are on the walls of his guest.
His reason for acquiring such a large quantity of albums and songs was due to his income: he could now buy plastics that he could not afford when they went out and buy items he had sold when he was young and on his own.
"Many of what I get is the end of the 60s, the beginning of the 70s, things that came up when I had 11 or 12, things for which I probably was too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics, most likely, are introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
It's my fault.
Uhar, who works in Sister Ray for 25 years, also believes that many clients he meets meet meet are according to the profile of YouGov.
However, he noted a new wave of people who were influenced by noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy their old plastics.
The judge on the talks I had had had escaped from my collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who ever sold their own fault to buy compact discs now sell their compact discs to buy their plastics," he says.
This may explain the noise among the perpetrators of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plastics?
It's enough to spend a couple of seconds in the store, like phonica, to understand that plastic stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Uhasa, some older clients, in particular, are undermining a free payment system.
Some lovers of guilt may feel a loss of digital peace and prefer to keep away from the constant conversions to plastics, which provoke the memory of unsatisfied youth.
"I think it can sometimes be filled with empty things or with material things as a sort of comfort," says Uh.
Just like I'm a collector, I have it, and I think there's a lot of people too.
It's a simple way to get your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a fellow from the plastic chair.
ICM's claim in April showed that nearly 50% of those who bought a wine album last month have not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent of the player they never used, whereas 7 per cent of the buyers who bought the prize did not have a plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look very disappointed at the fact that I was sitting with the Bosnian people.
The "trophy" aspect of recovery is what Johnny observed, 42 years old, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead plastic so we can put it in our pocket," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More manufacturing, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
They're younger people, not older, less than twenty, who only know about it.
Fopp, who has now responded to almost all the blame, is a much more diverse audience when I come.
There's a couple of 70 tourists who photograph boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less forced than in the above-mentioned shops — the latest sint and sex-and-pop Wild Beast, rather than the jazz improvisation, it is a pleasure to see the difference in its customers.
None of them look particularly unique, but the painful psychological trauma is hard to establish a 30-second position with someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various plastics available for sale.
She's looking at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn't work much, she says, so collecting plastics is not a very suitable option.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device is simple, but beauty is..." - It's loaded into a room with an uplifted love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really not happening again.
My last stop is the store, which they say, has contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers of wine: urban fashions.
While I create an illusion that I'm looking at the gender-related shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls, every minute collecting around the Polaroid camera, before the father and his daughter begin to discuss the purchase of the player Crosley.
On the left is a wall set up by Adele, Jeff Bacley, Amy Wynhaus and Flytwood Mac: we have modern style and classics, mandatory plastics for any medium collection.
No one will see — perhaps because they are just a trap, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to get caught.
It's this "apocalyptic violet."
However, given that any attracting attention to these items may mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the Soho deeper for some time, almost not to complain.
Not surprisingly, the people's share of which is more likely than most of them have more time and money than most of them are the share that spends most of their money on larger items, just as he did.
But as long as my findings show that youGov is accurate, at least in Socho plastic stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of female collectors and wine lovers who exist in reality, in plastic shops and online forums.
These people probably work all over the school or the office.
But they do not appear to be doing it on Thursday morning, passing plastic stores in Bervik Street, throwing plastics and avoiding the views of an unfriendly 30-year-old false leader, who is looking at the arrows of a man who has no doubts about the middle of the year.
Greenland polar bear — the longest caller — video count
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar bear has the greatest life span of all the calls on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record has set a male age from 272 to 512 years and a length of five meters.
French court rejects the proposal to set up a warehouse in the Jungley refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer by the authorities of Kale to destroy dozens of self-employed stores and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial hearings this week, the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to handle 72 self-employed stores, where people in the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or a simple blue for several euros in private restaurants.
Prefecture Kale said that these sites should be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they are at risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that stores and restaurants are vitally necessary, stating that the free blouses offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.
They said that self-sustained shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food for those in need.
The Lille Court decided that there was no legal basis for the exclusion of 72 self-employed people, but stated that the problems of the Kale Prefecture were “to be fully understood”.
Judge Jean-France Molla said that the bacals, coffees and restaurants played a far greater role than just the feeding of people who live in extreme conditions.
He said that the spaces provided a peaceful meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the threat of hunger was the children's coffee of the book of Jungle in the camp, which was not working for benefits and offered 200 meals a day, in English and French, and the advice to provide shelter for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying them in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect children's coffee.
A letter sent to Guardian stated that his closing would be “an accident for these children, some of whom are not eight years old”.
Two charitable agencies, the Relief of Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday assessed that the number in the Jungley camp had increased and exceeded 9,000 people — the highest in all history — after a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals during the summer.
Micro-regional libraries invite young people to get to know the program.
This week, libraries will hold meetings on the City Day, the Year of the Year of Russian Films, and even the physicist Day.
Programmes are focused on children's audience, so most of them are in play.
Today, August 10th, librarian No. 2, in the rural micro-regions, calls for a "Goldock My Little" presentation.
On August 11th, in the library No. 1, "I live in this city, I know this city."
The library of File No. 2 will be held on the same day in Multimedia, "The Land of the Child of the Minority".
And in the library No. 4 in Surajevke is a film, film, film.
On Wednesday, 14 August, the game program "Fiscult!" will be held for children from the north microcrowd of the library file No. 3.
Britain remains on the Serbian line 7 after the Master Class Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive British series in Regbi-7 has been reduced to the final opposition of the Fiji team to the final on Thursday evening when they were completely disintegrated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given the master class the power of the sword, the dispersion, the wearer, the support of the game, the escape of the line and the rough force to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The persecution was not too poor in the form of beer, the third in Britain per day, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Regby-7, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
The outbreak of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier that day, could have been returned to make a negative impression on them.
But no matter what, Fiji won the best team of 15 people in this form.
It may be some relief for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British wears a gold medal tomorrow: Chief coach Fiji - Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimblelon.
It was a trip to Great Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They lost everything here.
These attacks will cause pain, but progress is slow.
Fiji began a great time, for the entertainment of the Great Britain's attempt to catch the sword.
It was like getting on the bus column for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Oséa Colinisau went down to the corner.
Four minutes per hour, Jerry Tuwa added another to the right flag, which was realized.
12-0 and the Great Britain barely got under control of the sword.
The great attempt to capture Mitchell kept the man-in-law Leon Nacarauu from killing the third, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jassa Veremalu made a tacdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after renewal, and for hours there was still more minutes... in the first half.
Watemo Ravavo then went through a few more great attempts to recapture Britain, and the storm took a line to get a look.
The realization resulted in 29-0 interruptions.
It seemed that Fiji would be born for the game in Regbi-7 while Great Britain is still ruling.
That's quite the same.
The Great Britain has made massive shifts in half of the game, and they have bought a Fijian bomb... all four minutes, which was good for the first half until Joshua Tusov passed out after several devastating Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took a test for Britain, made a tacdown in the left corner to count 36-7, but a long time ago the game went on the way to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fantasies were burning flags and dancing on the tribunes.
It was impossible to be completely happy with Fiji’s approach.
Mata William was a fan of the Fijian cake, which he did not need to do, another attempt in the last seconds.
He called a mob, the Fijians drowned, and the Great Britain fell on the scene, completely out of the way.
Earlier that day, Fiji won Japan from 20 to 5 in its semifinals, and Britain soon joined South Africa in an intense semi-final of one attempt at each — the difference between Britain and the United Kingdom.
Kyle Brown takes Boks in front of the first half, but Dan Norton, with the help of some great work, broke his leg and killed himself in the second half.
The most recent attempt by Marcus Watson, a brother of the 15th English team, Anthony, has won — and in the end, a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning were inspired to win the battle against cancer
There'll be no more loud gold on these games, and that's what they're talking about.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy ceilings in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning have found the added significance of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who held the feast, there were three voices in this boat, the former coach Robin Williams was always trying to get to the second Olympic gold class in women's pairs, the first women in the British sports annals that were brought to such heights.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unquestioned, unforeseeable expression.
As we see, two flashy sportsmen using the elegant lebedas do not fully reflect the nature of the triumpha.
Each gold has been stolen by the battalion of ready-made hands that contribute to gradually increasing winnings that are important, and no hand that was more important than the trainer’s hands 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer did not know if he would survive before he could see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had a brain tumor, which is one of what they can operate, and they did it.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
That could be a bad situation.
It's kind of changing your looks for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio pointed out that he could start treatment in the mid-term early 2014 by maintaining a minimum breakdown of the schedule, if that could be a proper expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed a paycheck, so I needed to fix it quickly.
That's an incentive.
I was in the hospital and played at the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per hour, although they had a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The bed itself is a journey, but it does do a little more.
Their first thoughts were about Williams, who had spent the morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own life.
Stanning, captain of the Artillery Field Service in Afghanistan, said, "I was emotionally divorced this week, maybe a little bit, but that's very important."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so does Robin.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't even ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning didn't miss a race in five years.
This couple has a tense rhythm that their competitors have never been able to match.
Even in the last 500 yards [500 m], when New Zealand and Denmark's teams began to get closer, Staning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were strong at the stage.
Helen said, 'Stay in the process, stay in the process.'
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything boring.
We didn't expect firemen today, we just hoped we could make a good mistake and get out and win this race we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
Glover must be on his wedding date next month, on his own with a television searcher, Steve Becksholm.
Now she just wants to enjoy it for a moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to find out that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was so new, and I was so excited.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctions
By the end of 2017, the Government had extended the deadline for the destruction of food prohibited from imports into Russia.
The relevant decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who was published at the official legal office.
With regard to the countries which imposed anti-terrorism sanctions on Ukraine, it was introduced into our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended several times, and it is now operating until 31 December 2017.
In Russia, imports of certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs from the United States, the countries of the Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein are prohibited.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, sea products, fruit, fruit and milk products were prohibited.
The use of food imported into the country in the context of the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only about 100 tonnes of prohibited products were released for the first quarter of 2016.
The smell of a ban.
On Friday, rain and hail are expected in Moscow.
Through the capital region, the atmosphere will pass through the front, which will bring down and lower air temperature.
The air is heated up to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C].
Yes, on Saturday night in Moscow, there will be short-lived rain, possible storms and windfalls up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to be raining with storms and windfalls up to 12-17 m/s.
Threats are also predicted in the Orlov, Kurd and Voronej areas, reporting "Dani.ru".
The next working week, the sentences are minor.
The WTO Arbitrary Panel established that Russian imports of butter, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the Organization's rules.
The import duties exceeded the obligations of Russia upon entry into the WTO.
“This is the first case when the WTO has taken a decision against the FIF,” says an official organization website.
However, the Arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the Euro-Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia ' s measures were "systematic" or "wide".
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt the import routes to the book and refrigerators in the near future.
That is what the report of the Russian Ministry of Economic Affairs has said.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
That is what the Government of Ukraine has been saying.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the conduct of the United States of America in resolving issues in the WTO undermines the principles of discussion.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, Eurojust and other WTO members because of the refusal of Americans to approve the second term of South Korean Judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not be addressed to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the IMF.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The Chairman ' s Administration changed the leadership
President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration of former Deputy Sergei Ivanova Anton Vaino.
Vladimir Putin withdrew from the presidential administration and expressed his hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wayne said during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that he had begun to take over as President Ivanov's head of administration and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, "News" had written that the experts considered the situation with the withdrawal of Sergei Ivanova from the office of the head of the administration of transparency and understanding and the withdrawal of anything in principle did not change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the manager, who worked in the administration of the President, has worked well for a long time, has effectively established the ACP.
Instead, the deputy head of the administration of Anton Wayne was a man who was well aware of the specificities of this work.
In Poland, they're not going to buy fuel at the Gusprom.
The Polish company PGNIG does not exclude that, over several years, the gas supply from the RF could be unappreciative to it due to the re-orientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
The vice-president of the Polish finance company Boluslav Magez.
His words are transmitted by TASS.
"It may happen that we won't buy gas (in "Gazproma") at all, we are now diversifying our supplies.
Over the next four years, the main supply directions for us will become East, a commodity from the IPG-Terminals and Norway," said the Magjez.
"Gazprom" is currently taking over the dominant position in gas supplies in Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, GGNIG reported that in the first half of 2016, the Russian supplier placed nearly 5.3 billion cubic m of gas at 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in GGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent earlier.
We remember that on 22 July, the Polish Anti-Personnel Office did not agree to the establishment of a joint undertaking called "Gazproma" and its European partners on the construction of the North Stream-2 gas pipeline.
Earlier this month, Poland left a request for "Gazpromo" to supply 11 billion cubic m of gas for "Northern flow-2".
The Vice-President of the Dutch Government, Alexander Medvedev, made this statement.
The auctions for the North Stream-2 power will be held in 2017 and the auction will be planned on its board in June 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that "Gazprom" had not yet planned to take action against the intention of the Polish party to withdraw from long-term contracts for gas supply from Russia after 2022, the Vice-President of the Government of the company Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, only 42 per cent of the gas purchases from the RFB increased by only 42 per cent.
In the meantime, Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG had made a statement in the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean that negotiations would cease.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to obtain a lower purchase price on Russian gas.
Recall that the authorized Government of Poland on the gas and energy infrastructure of Peter Niimski reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the agreement with the Gaspromo on gas supply.
The Polish contract with Gazpromo was signed in 1996 and expired in 2022.
In March, the authorized Government of Poland on the gas and energy infrastructure of Peter Niimski stated that his country could withdraw from the supply of deep fuel from the east.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of frozen natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will unite the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
The North Stream-2 provides for the construction of two marine gas pipelines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic m of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the OSCE has increased the number of observers around Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first PMM agreement in Ukraine, Alexander Hugh.
"I can confirm that SMEs have increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the relevant issue of journalists, "REA News".
According to the OSCE, the situation on the Ukraine and Crimean border has not been established.
Observers followed the three crossing points through the Russian-Ukraine border.
A video on the Ufé airport was shown on the network, which was stretched across the air-conditioning area at 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was released on the "360" TV.
The CP took place at 4.30 in Moscow.
Reys of KrasAvia's airline arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where they were not injured.
Only the aircraft was transported to the station.
Ufy Airport works in normal mode.
The pre-trial investigation of the transport of the SCR has revealed the causes of the heavy landing of a liner.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission investigates the possible use of toxic gas in the occupied areas of the Syrian city of Alipo.
All sides of the conflict reject the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria Stefan de Mistura considers the fact that it has been undisputed.
Such statements called for the completion of the third round of inter-sessional negotiations that should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists started a study on reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Alippo.
The first information on the toxic gas tract, which is likely to be chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then claimed that in the area where the attack was launched by a Russian military transport helicopter, the aircraft had dropped bombs on the explosives, but in Moscow, these charges were called explosives.
Later, the Ministry of Defence of Russia accused the opposition group of Harakit Nur ad-Din Az-Zinki.
Soon it became known that two of the bombs had been produced by toxic gas.
This confirmed BBC one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the fire began to burn my eyes, and it was hard to hear," says the viewer's release.
As a result of the attack, at least seven people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of exhaust gas is confirmed by experts, actions will be considered as a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria Stefan de Mistura told journalists: "The evidence that this really happened is a lot."
The Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CFCS) provides for the inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes.
Despite all sides of the Syrian conflict denying the use of toxic gases, 35 cases of the use of the Syrian army against “major opposition” by human rights defenders in 2015.
The situation in Aleppo is disturbing that the bombings of its areas are taking place every day, and terrorists are preventing the arrival of residents from leaving the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations is waiting for Russia to establish a "gumantic break" in military action.
The current three-hour stay in the organization is considered “not enough to help nearly 2 million peaceful citizens who have been caught.”
Councillor Stefan de Mistura on Humanitarian Affairs, John Egelan, said that 48 hours of fire would be required to be delivered to the city to help and evacuate the sick and injured every week.
"We have to send large quantities of goods from colonial cargo to places where roads are virtually destroyed and what are left is gone," said Mr. Egelan. - But the Russian delegation confirmed the readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "gumanic pause" continue.
As Russia opened the "gumantic windows" in Aleppo.
Under the continuing struggle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, announced on 11 August the introduction of a three-hour regime for the end of war, which will start every day from Thursday.
The establishment of the "gumantic oceans" has been called upon to provide conditions for the supply of medicines, food and items in the city of first need.
The decision of the Minoboron RF was adopted on the basis of an increasing international pressure on Moscow, with a request to return to the military operation and to facilitate the renewal of the negotiating process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the streets of Thailand, four people were killed.
Soon a few explosions erupted in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 injured.
The explosive epicenter came to the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, four States nationals, and no Russians.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken by one of the terrorist groups, but the country's MDG has been speeding up the claim that Islamists are not involved in it.
A number of people have already been detained, suspecting the organization of explosions.
According to the preliminary data from the local police, the extent and specificity of the explosions indicate that they were sent to the military-led country.
The attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including the Patongue beach in Phuket and the city of Hoa-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
Following the arrival of a military census in 2014, the economic growth declined from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that demonstrated development.
By 2016, 14 million people had been visited, with 1.5 million more in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attack have already been detained, reported to the police officer Krisana Patanacharoen.
As soon as possible, he added, however, in the country's MDGs, "it is believed that they are not related to international extremist groups".
Too early to make conclusions, Mr. Patanacheronen said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any form of terrorism, in fact, these local differences, and we are trying to establish the identity of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the day of the birth of King Thailand Secret.
The Thai Hunta considers the protection of monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is more likely to be directed against it.
According to the statement made by the Police General of the City of Srisopacheroenrate, the bombs were fired at a distance from time to time.
They were dragged inside trees on live streets filled with tourists eating in restaurants.
It has been known that one of the four victims has become a Thai girl, trading street gambling.
The remaining victims are still unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Police of Thailand, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and Austrian citizens.
The Russians are not among the victims of the explosion, reports the press service Rosturisma.
Local experts also associated the explosions with the last 7 August referendum, with 61.4% of the country ' s population supporting the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Commission on the Development of a Constitution designated by the Military Hunt.
The voter was required to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper chamber of Parliament was fully appointed to the military and played a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested first in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that, on 22 May 2014, Thailand experienced a military revolution under the leadership of the commander of the country's Prauto-Ocha army.
As he said, the army was moving forward in the ongoing political crisis and there was no progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The soldiers established the National Council of Peace and Order, set up a commandal time and censorship, held the protestary and upper room of Parliament.
Like Bangkok was in a state of emergency
In January 2014, the Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinaav, announced the introduction of an emergency situation in Bangkok and the capital of the provinces.
The special regime has been extended for 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, at the Bangkok Centre in the monument of the Battle, which was one of the main acts of the protest, two explosions occurred that affected 28 people and five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions caused unknown motorcycles.
The authorities tried to ensure security in the capital and attracted the military forces to protect demonstrators.
In Sukhlo Loge, conditions began to develop.
As is known, the Government is proposed to agree on the draft terms of auction on the Suhao Log, with two key constraints.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25 per cent and more belong to foreigners, and those who claim that there will be no less than 25 per cent of the attendance.
The industry does not expect the Government to overwrite the conditions, noting that many games are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auctions can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry has introduced to the Government a draft order and auction conditions for the largest undeveloped gold settlement in the Suhao Log (Irkutsk area, stocks and resources of 130 million ounces), two sources of "E", known as the situation.
The project introduced in the middle of the evening is one of them.
In the Ministry of the Interior, "E" confirmed that the project was submitted to the Government.
The representative of the corrupt non-use of Vice-President Alexander Cloponin said that the project had not yet arrived in the hands of the press.
"The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the Government's departure, and in view of the deadline for the gathering of potential participants (at least 45 days) tenders can be held in October," said Minprirod.
According to the "E" data, two key requirements were maintained in the project for potential participants described in the option that was sent to the Ministry and FOIW in July (e.g. " E").
First, there are at least 25 per cent of the bidders' capital.
Second, refusal to access auctions for foreign investment companies based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investment in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FZ, as already stated on 2 August, the auctions may not allow companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are not tax residents of the FF or have double citizenship.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions as the Suhai Log refers to the federal value of more than 50 tons of gold.
In the Ministry, it confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on details prior to the Government ' s administration.
The need for participation in the capital of the auction participants was raised by the Irkutsk area, speaking in December 2015 in Minprirod and subsequently confirmed by the Governor of the region of Sergei Levcenko, noting that it was sent to Minprirod, its predecessor, Sergeem Euroštenko, "have an investment agreement with Rosteh".
Those who have blocked restrictions on the admission of foreigners, "E" do not clarify.
"But in the spirit of time: not to give control to the largest gold location in Russia on the basis of Western sanctions," said the speaker "E", marked by the auction preparation.
Prime Minister Sergei Donsk's head said on August 1, that foreigners could "go into the Consortium", if the claimants were to attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The "E" contractors consider it unlikely that the government would correct the conditions.
The main claimant of Suhai Log in the industry is the Consortium of the biggest gold producer of the RFPA "Polus", the under-control son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rosteh".
As he wrote, in July, partners created SL Gold, where Paulus was 51 per cent, RST-GR was 49 per cent.
In Rosteche, they rejected comments, in Paul, that "E" was clearly interested in this asset and that they had all the necessary skills and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and form of our participation will be taken after the conditions have been announced," they added, "Paul".
The auction may take part in the ALROSA, but a decision by the RDF Government, the sources of "E".
The Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which are developing assets in Chukotke, had been declared able to participate in the development of the Suho logo, while Polymetal and Nordgold, on the "e" data, were not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of gold industry RF Sergey Kashuba assessed "E" investments in Suhayo Log at $2,5-4 billion.
Most potential claimants fear not only the amount of investments but also the complexity of the project: a serious monitoring of stocks and the technology of work with hard wheels is needed, and the "E" partners in the industry are justified.
In the pension market, the biggest M&A transaction, the KIT Finance Pension Administrator, launched the process of combining four controlled NPFs.
As a result, the Gazfund Pensions Fund will be established with a total of approximately 373 billion rubs.
On the commencement of the procedure for the merger of four pension funds, the KIT Finance, the Promagrofon, the Follow-up and the GAS Fund of Pensions, the owner of 100 per cent of the OO Fund, the KIT Finance Pension Administrator reported yesterday.
“Reorganization shall be carried out in accordance with the CB, in compliance with the requirements for non-compliance with the terms of the existing treaties”, said the company.
The merger is based on the Gasfund Pensions Foundation.
As noted by the NPF Director, Oleg Belarus, the merger of the funds allows a number of challenges to be addressed: increasing the geography of attendance, concentration of resources for development, reduction of costs, promotion of best practices for each of the funds and optimisation of corporate governance.
According to him, the reference period for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the Gazfund Pensions Fund, the OPS market will become the biggest player.
According to data on 31 March, the amount of pension funds combined exceeded 373 billion rubs.
As reported on the Fund website, their owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, is currently Anatoly Gavirilenko (65 per cent of OOs controlled) and GASF (35 per cent).
However, only the merger of the group has led to a large number of competitors later.
Yes, the O1 NPF “The Future” sub-control group was still in the beginning of the current year.
At present, the combined NIF is joining the Uralsib and the Russian standard.
“Union in a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to address structural challenges,” notes NFF “The Future” Director Nicolai Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has since April also been carried out in the Safmar pension group -- the "European", "Research and Science" and "Reagan Fund" to the Safmar NAF until the end of the current year.
In 2017, it will be joined by the trust fund.
“The merger of funds will have an impact on control over risks, operational processes and costs”, noted in the Safmar pension group.
The pause in the merger of the funds held by the KIT Finance Pension Administrator may be caused by several reasons, experts indicate.
Until recently, NIFs could not acquire more than 40 per cent of the deployment of infrastructure obligations in which the group was active.
Following amendments to the CB resolution in March of this year on a number of issuers that meet the regulatory requirements, such restrictions are no longer applicable.
If necessary, all outputs can buy one big game," the director of the rating group of AKRA financial institutions, Yuri Noggin.
Several NFP leaders from the top 15 on assets for another possible reason call the impact area division and, as a result, the individual appointments in the single fund, which were to be agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavirilenko was not available for comments.
They also didn't answer the "E" call in the Gazfund NPF.
While the consolidation of funds is a work-and-work activity, this decision will be justified in the long term.
As noted by Sergei Ocolesov, director of the Pension Partner's Consulating Company, the Gazfonda Pension Collections, will allow the accession to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
In doing so, more successful NPF experience "CIT Finance" and "Promagrofonda" will be developed in the construction of various OPS sales, as well as in the use of a more modern PPO.
The needs of the CB for processes and the NPF framework are constantly growing, so to double infrastructure on four funds in a single investment policy is considered inappropriate, as the managing director for the corporate ratings of the "Expert R" by Paul Mitrofanov.
“The effect of reducing double functions will significantly reduce the possible costs of mergers,” said Mr. Mitrofanov.
The combined costs of the four funds of Sergei Ocolesov are estimated at 30-50 million rubs.
"The cost of the four funds of these amounts is approximately 400 million rubs per year, with the medium-term consolidation of the budget actually reduced by two," said Mr. Okolesnov.
The Russian pro was the best discrepancy film on Pete and his dragon.
The beautiful New Zealand species, the gentle dragon, the mind - boggling history, and the song in the canary are enough to re-believe in an old-fashioned magic, consider Elena CRAVCUN.
The young man threatened the dragon, who became a human child and a bear, and was betrayed by another.
Pete calls his friend Elliott, and he plays with him in the dogonal and sleeps in the kitchen.
Six years after he was raised, grew up, and married, he was no longer separated from another thought wooden sorghum of Maugley.
In such a way, Pita and her brother, her brother, aggressively steals wood, is found by a fishing woman named Grace (Bris Dallas Howard).

How did Director David Loury manage to remove the fantastic love scene of the 1977 dragon Pitt film, from the middle of the nose to the end of the chaos and only the mix of animation and game film, and make it the most heart movie this summer?
Not exactly how the miracle helped.

CRC journalist Alexander Sokolova filed a new charge
Lawyers of the RBC, Alexander Sokolova, accused of organizing extremist structures, stated that the prosecution found insufficient evidence of their protection.
We learned from the investigators that the prosecutor had made such submissions yesterday.
We were scheduled to attend a court meeting on the limitation of information on criminal matters, but the meeting was not yet held, and our investigators informed us of the prosecutorial submission."
She said that the prosecutor had indicated to the investigators that the case and the collected material were not in conformity with the qualifications of the investigators.
The investigators now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new charge.
Either the second article of the Criminal Code (WC) will appear in the case or remain, but with other evidence and new evidence, Ms. Denze will explain.
As Alexander Sokolov reported, he was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that, as a result, it was excluded from the press journalist ' s accusation of "an extension of the political situation on the part of instability" and "the strengthening of authority by illegal means".
Correspondent of Commersantbossport, ALEXANDR ZILIBERT lived an Olympic life in the Olympics, inspected the house of a Russian collection, bought it at the local table, and even came after this WADA test.
Life here doesn't seem like a second.
Even at night.
The last start is sometimes over in the evening, after which sportsmen need another half-two hour to return to the Olympics.
In addition, the village and village of the village are uninterrupted, as some of the athletes finish their talks and leave Brazil, and some of the others are only here.
Well, at 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be held in one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues - the leader of the Olympics delegation of the Russian team, Igorh Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which we were settled, consider it to be an example - was put into operation by one of the first and demonstrated by all the verifyers, even in the case of the incident.
It's a hot water problem, so, excuse me, with unitasms.
We've been fighting for a long time.
At first, no one came to pick up.
And then the clinics came, but they're just asking for some substance on the ground, yes, everything.
Half of them, you see some innovations.
Mal, I can't sell them human.
Let's know that this field is a standard laminate!
In general, changes have been made to the clearing company and now all of this is OK.
The Olympic Village is such a South Boutovo, a sleeping area surrounded by one side of the town, with others, with an inner wall, where water flowed.
Well, there's still a two-metre rail line that's all over the perimeter.
All in the forest can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
One of the 18th-century buildings is covered by a huge Russian flag - this house is totally abandoned to the needs of our congregation.
In view of the small fires at the entrance, it is possible to quickly determine what problems appear to be the most pressing for the parent team.
At the end of the registration, there are two announcements: the printed "Pásaluista, don't blow a book in the toilet!" and from the hand "First in a sign.
The rest of us are stuck in the booklets.
Their happy development contrasts with the headings of the brochure: “The Memory of Infectious Diseases for Those Exposed in Rio de Janeiro”, “The First Help in Insecting, Indignification, Indignity in the Breathing Paths, Loss of Awareness, Heart and Rehabilitation,” “The First Help in Respiration, Warming, Transfusion and Blood Disorders”.
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by lyophilisate and subsequent treatment.
However, not everyone is looking forward to a good outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre in Russia, which at any time is ready to provide qualified assistance to the home, including a weakened and sporty mass.
On the contrary, the medical centre itself is the headquarters of our delegation.
It's a nice little thing with the door. It's an exciting cry, "No matter what we win!"
Well, of course:
All the arguments are an absolute bond!
Only those who fear will believe in them.
Let us down, so the taste of victory, Russia won't give up, it won't break!
And for the increase of the spirit, it is proclaimed: "O my brethren and my sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriots of Moscow and all Russian Cyrillics, the Olympics of the Russian Federation have been provided with spiritual protection by the Protoiers of Andrey Vladimirovich Alexev.
Order a prayer and other demands on the phone...
In general, there is a centre of meditation and religious services for representatives of all conferences in the village.
Well, the roses get in a privileged position - they have their own time.
With regard to the load of elevators from the ninth stage on the fourth floor, I decided to land on a ship that was recommended to be used during fire.
And in the dark there was about her body lying on it.
Of course, these were the sleepy staff of the new clinic.
I believe that at any time they were ready to break on the edge of innovation sex, they decided to set up a quiet time right on cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was looking forward to a meeting with a former famous Vitali Fedorovic Dubko, a coach of our Battistas who brought them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He, along with the European champion Jan Paul, agreed to show his rooms.
We live on two, bleeding, of course, almost in sight, but it's not critical.
He's got one on four, but that's why he's gone.
Scaff, of course, is funny, but trust doesn't call, but something can be put.
"No, you're accusing them of the tea they're done!" said the tennisist Svetlan Kuznezova, who met me at the main table.
It is called primarily because it represents 2.7,000 square miles of space and is ready to accept 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are up to 60,000 pears in the bag completely free.
Menu options are: "Best from Brazil", "Kuhini Peace", "Asiatian Blue" and "Go, Macaron products".
The last option I've seen is to use a lot of popularity in our volleyballs.
However, I'm saying I didn't find any of the giant restaurant units.
- What kind of soup?
It's good that I'm a Chinese hostage.
And a Chinese.
But in general, to understand, we've got a lot worse food on the shorts.
There's something you can choose, despite the unexplained unity.
I've personally chosen a couple and a fricade in a tomato sauce.
A table with each leaf is available in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as in the food value of the product and its contents.
Well, it's all right to admit it was.
I don't even know why such an order is always in McDonald's local.
Old, weak, we can say "hot" sportsmen out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - the representatives of the World Anti-dipping Agency (WADA).
They're undermining the boat - a Victorian winner who gets a football.
They're exaggerating, you can say!
In order to receive a gift, it must be answered with the right answer to eight of the ten questions.
- There's questions on the Russian! - A woman from WADA attacked me.
But not on that attack.
That's what I'm doing in a patriotial storm, of course.
The situation had already been raised on the second question: "If I have received notice of the passage of doping control, should I enter the doping control item immediately?"
I stopped at option B: "I don't have one hour."
He's lost, so say it.
I forgot that WADA's weaklings don't come.
In general, it has to be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the Victorian situation, my situation became quite critical.
Why did I think that if I would find it hard to follow a balanced diet because of my flat chart (and I can hardly stand!), I can use biofuels to get "additional nutrients to improve my productivity".
No, they don't!
In fact, the answer is expressed in that it is not categorically prohibited, but it is urgent that several proposals be answered.
It's not fair to play WADA!
Well, what's the matter, Russia?
To escape somewhere - behind Ephemova, Isinbaeva and all our hidden command.
That's why I focused, and I've won the most unhappy football.
You know what they're talking about, ours!
In a winning mood, I took it to the fitness center next door.
You're in charge of coaches.
It's 250.
Surprisingly, no Russian sportsmen had found any escape routes in this effort.
But maybe that's right?
Let those who play be trained who can't!
And here's one of our guys sitting in a couple of polylines.
On the side of the occult.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In the police station, as well as in all the trees where there's no rain, there's a storage device.
And he was called from a blessed place, saying, "Exalted with the Condo!"
The only thing to do is to cut the iron that reminds you of the door lock, and preserves made from the natural lattice of Amazonia are ready to come out of the apartment.
I took myself to memory.
Sportsmen won't wake up. They've got 450 thousand.
As a time for a holiday and a holiday tour in the Olympic Forest, there is an entire entertainment centre.
In any case, there is a well-known table that reminds the International Olympic Committee that it spends $3.25 million a day on sportsmen in various ways.
The centre is covered with videos, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockeys and some strange devices that look like video coaches.
That's what it is? - I'm interested in a company in the form of a Ukrainian collection, which is actively using a dikkin toy.
I could, of course, just say that you don't want to talk to a man in the form of Russia, yes, everything.
Here, you can see that some strange situation in your eyes is more like a kid in a yellow-black.
It's the most exciting collection.
In order to cover the entire village, I looked at each corner of it, it took not less than three hours.
But if it's just to walk and not build on the electricity, you're also opened a Canadian house with a lot of wood in the entrance and chatro with a refurbished bathroom, a ticket office, a washing office, a washing machine, a parking lot, a color shop, and a dining room with everyday goods, and an e-mail with unique brands (only you can't even move around from the Chinese Philistines), and the bank, and the office of discovery, and the photocas.
And later in the evening, you will sit down on a olive tree planted by a variety of plants in memory of those who left this world for friends and relatives.
And you'll be in the company of a machine that's uncontrollable enough to kill people, to think about it forever.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which does not stop in this village for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world was breathless, Australians were probably not punished by the American Dream Team, these patients went to the network.
Little one knows: I got the first news that Inna Derigalsov won gold in the rapper at the twenty-first Olympic Games.
Maybe I'm even the only Muslim who saw how it happened - without thinking about who saw the funeral in Carioca that night.
This can only be understood by this patient.
Here's an old Moscow night.
Neighbors down - as always at night - fall and begin to feel bad, but it's very hard to shout at each other.
And it's dangerous to move furniture.
On the kitchen floor, there is no time to come to the market and buy as a sandwich, a new one.
There's nothing in the television schedule, so he just kept control of Mattch, First and in any case Russia -- even though it's almost pointless.
"Rossia" is a family of repeats, all sports there for some reason in the records.
The series is translucent there.
Hope, of course, at "Match" -- a young man's entire night screamed in news releases about the great semifinal of Dirigalsova ---Shanaeva, then about the coming war on gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of this basketball, it's the United States-Australia.
I can't tell you anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half won.
They've put in place those who've got their own size Americans.
As a result, they have lost, but as it is now said, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer exist.
It's all right, but it's close to the fight with the French and on the screen without a change.
I'm starting to roll up the channels in the easy pancake.
That's how it's going to be.
All right, let's go deep on the cables.
Not one of thematic "Matche" filtrations.
And I feel that war is starting.
The text and tweets of some sports sites do not disturb me.
Road surfing gives unexpected, but frustrating results.
The “First”, it is said, is the direct technical transmission of all mergers that are currently taking place.
I'm looking for a fhetto, I'm getting a piece of gold.
The directive is excellently contrasted, it goes forward - and it's clearly starting to take time.
The Italian plays almost all the shooting.
Our eyes on one eye forward, by the end of a few more seconds.
Di Francesca is breaking down on the Deriglesov and disappears when the time comes to end, the Italians wear a helmet.
Victory!
In a couple of seconds, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports on the fourth gold medal.
It turns out I'm the first one to see it with my eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the sharers.
The spiritual administration of the Muslim (DUM) Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in dreams.
Yesterday, the DUM plenary had the responsibility of conveying the fifth sermons only on the Tatar so that young fathers would stop “learning their native language.”
The administration stated that it was "not in any case a violation" of the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some houses, Kazani states that there are fewer than 60 per cent indigenous people, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
We are afraid that their sermons on the Tatar "will not come to the whole audience."
Yesterday, the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to carry out the five-week preaching in the homes of the Republic only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin put it, this should be an incentive for young fathers to “learn their native language.”
"For those who say it's heavy," said Mr. Samigullin, in each large room, we intend to organize lessons in the Tatar language absolutely free.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and that today in all the churches, the preaching should “be in the Father’s language”.
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan is publishing the "Shura" magazine with typical teaching in the Tatar language.
I've got one that doesn't speak well enough, "it can be thoroughly prepared."
DUM Tatarstan combines more than a thousand revenues in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Mufti, the five - day preaching in the area is directed exclusively in the Father’s language.
At the same time, Russian language was used earlier in a number of camps in Kazakhstan.
In particular, as the mufta indicated, it was practiced in the Burna Valley, Zakaban and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the leadership was a task for all students to have both public languages, regardless of nationality.
"No harm can be said about the Muslim netator," Mr. Muhametzin stressed, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a compulsory, basic part of the reward."
At the same time, prayers will continue to be read in Arabic, and the lectures and lessons in Russian will be preserved.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametzin said that there was no serious threat to the removal of the Tatar language from the graves.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, he notes, preaching in the Republic is not used.
The DUM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Conference on Tatar (WCT).
The head of the U.K. Chief of Staff Rinth Zaquirov said "E" "Mechatti is an important part of our national life".
It would be boring if I had left that area with a tattoo.
He noted that preaching in the Father's language was only "the desire of the owners", but instead of the WTO "they considered it right".
The "E" we have, who preach in Russia, are willing to comply with the DUM decision, but believe that there will be difficulties with the understanding of the clergy.
They're going to the game with the tattoos and the Russians.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they'll be there.
"It's time to stop," I said, "I've got the Burnaev House of Farhat Maveldin.
According to him, the preaching in Russian is even closer to many Tatars, because "the Russian and the schools, and the children, on the radio are important."
However, he believes that in the dream, lessons and lessons can be continued in the Russian language that are held in other days.
In God do we put our trust.
Allah will show you the way out."
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
It's the Uzbek, the Taji and the Azerbaijani.
We have a lot of foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," I say.
He believes that the preaching in the Father's language will "come to a shorter circle and not come to the whole audience".
But we're going to follow the plan.
It's just that the preaching will be different.
But time will show.
"For example, it will be easier for me, because Tatar language is my family," said Gabriel Galiullin.
Former Director of FSIN has been dismissed by the court
The Moscow Attorney-General has approved a criminal hearing on the investigation of the SCR in respect of the budget allocations to the requirements of the Russian FCIN.
Before the court, the ex-head of the prison office, Alexander Reymer and his deputy, who had suffered a loss of more than 2.7 billion rubs, would be brought before the court.
The Central Prosecutor sent a criminal case against former director of the FSIN Russian Federation, Alexander Remerer, former deputy of Nicolaa Krivolapova, as well as the head of the FGUP, the Information and Technology Centre of the Federal Criminal Service (FGUP CITOS) Victor Determinov.
Depending on the role and extent of participation in crimes, they are accused of the CSC in Moscow under paragraph 3 of paragraph 285 of the FIFG (use of heavy-impact official powers), p. 4 of paragraph 159 of the FRF (intensities made using its official status, in the composition of an organized group, in particular large size).
In addition, Crivopas is accused of being a member of the U.K.R.R. (unlawful acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the JRC, in 2010-2012, the persons designated by the MIC have received the budgets allocated to the FSI for the provision of electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, as well as for electronic explosives.
In order to collect the budget money, the group developed a scheme whereby the CITOS sub-competitive undertaking, which concluded the relevant public contracts, produced technical means of control and supervision, including “electronics”, and implemented several times over the prices.
Despite the absence of production equipment, buildings, facilities for capacity-building to create a final cycle of "electronic beams" production, five gas contracts were concluded between them and the Russian Federation.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubs were made on the accounts of the FGUP branch, of which 1.2 billion rubs were stolen.
As a result, more than 140 million rubs of funds were received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office by one of the participants in the criminal proceedings for which he was assigned in a separate production.
Nicola Krivopava, involved in the machining, found an unknown origin of the patrol to the prize gun, which allowed him to be charged with additional charges.
According to the case of 133 tonne, the FSIC filed a claim for compensation for material damage of 2.7 billion rubs.
Hakan Schukura football player suspects in part on the road.
The Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for an ex-footed football player and then a member of parliament, Hakan Schukura, and searched for his family's two houses.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s was the beginning of the 2000s attack by the authorities of the country in connection with the attempt by the government to convert the past month.
Forvard, who completed his career in 2008, was accused of belonging to the “armed terrorist group”.
This is about the Xizmet movement, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious leader and oppositioner, Fethullah Gulen.
His President, Erdogan, is the organizer of the military conversion attempt, which took place on 15 July.
Fethulla Gulen lives in the United States, and Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media reports, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Schukura, and the police have already searched two houses belonging to the family of an ex-footed football player.
As a result, his father also entered the organization of Fethhullah Guilena, in addition to Hakan Shukuru himself.
However, neither the former football player nor his close associates did.
He and his family are now living in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukhur protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and spoke for the country.
He spent most of his career in Galtasara.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Tourno", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
True, not one of them had spent more than one season.
Huan Shukür has so far remained the most successful attacker in Turkey: 112 matéres for the national team and 51 sheep killed.
In 2013, Hakan Shukür left his delegation post because of the initial corruption investigation of the Erdogan Party and its vicinity.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, an arrest warrant was issued in Turkey on 25 July at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of promoting military conversion and ties with opposition Islamic preacher Fethulla Gulen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the gravity of the charges, IMI staff can wait for long-term prison terms from ten years to several lifetimes.
Egor Conchalovski wants to create a network of filmmakers only for home movies.
"I would create a network of filmmakers exclusively for Russian cinema, with tickets at 2-3 times less than in foreign production movies," he said.
Mr. Conchalovski notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 images per year in the country, from 20 to 25 tapes per year to the screen.
"Even they find it very difficult to interact with the "Transformers" and "The Green Man", with the promotion of large budgets," said the cinematographer.
Remember, on 1 July, in Crimea, the World Youth Education Forum, "Tavrida" began its work.
The participants were teachers of creative and youth professionals from various creative and humanitarian directions throughout Russia and a number of countries close to and far away.
Britain's Olympic gold in academia in twos
The British Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning broke the Olympic gold in academia in two.
Serbians Rebecca Scoun and Geneva Berne took the new arrivals, and Anna Anderson and Hedwig Rasmussen from Denmark took third place.
U-Newsty - The New Genocider promises to send Zenit Arenu to 26 December.
A new generator built at St. Petersburg Stadium, which is to be hosted by the Cuban Confederation 2017 and the 2018 World Football Championship, Metrostroy, promises to award an award by 26 December, informs RIA News, referring to the time commission of the Federal Federation for the Preparation of the Football Championship 2018 Vadima Tullpanova.
"Today we, together with Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko, visited the strike, with us was the "Metrostro" generator Vadim Alexander.
He said the stadium would be over by 26 December.
It's a serious Petersburg company, it's never breaking the deadlines.
Vitaly Mutko and I have remained quite visible and heard," the agency quotes the interviewer.
Previously, Vitaly Mutko had arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the location of the upcoming mass funerals.
Mr. Tulpanov also noted that his board of directors of the Sufeda Commission would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would visit the site regularly.
Remember, yesterday it was known that the company "Metrostroy" would complete the construction of Zenit Arena, the contract value would be about 5.4 billion rubs. The same company won trade in the well-being of the area around the stadium, the value of the contract - 2.4 billion rubs. The contracts with AO "Transstry", OO "Ingining Corporation "Transstry-SPB" and AO "Ingining Corporation "Transstroy" were broken down.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.

In Miasse (Chelabin Region), a former vice-president lawyer, Nicolai Sandakova Konstantin Akulic, was detained.
As another lawyer, Sergei Colossian, told U-South Ural, who was accused of committing crimes, had been called to the CPR Miass' Investigation Division today.
Constantine Akulic then went to the TTP as a lawyer to assist one of his party.
"It was a little excited about the unknown, and now that he started protecting Nicolas Sandakova, it turns out that it was Akulic," Sergei Colossian says.
Constantine Akulic became an ex-composer lawyer in early August.
In the meantime, before the appeal of the defence counsel in the DPRK, Miass informed the defence party that on Monday, there was a deadline for learning about the cases of fraud in which Nicolai Sandakov was accused.
We remember two criminal cases against Nicolas Sandakov.
Under the first (part of the fraud), he was violated a promise of 1.5 million rubs to assist in the appointment of the Chief of Magnitogor of the Administration of Osserska Evgenia Tarasov.
The second criminal case relates to the receipt that Nikolai Sandakov received from the Director of the PIO "Piton" Igorya Kalugina in the form of an unlawful free-of-charge supply of property services at least 1.3 million rubs.
Read more about Mr. Sandakova in the "E" article "The former vice-president needs to unite his affairs."
The Russian media company (RMK) is ready to take social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally "bad" enterprises in the Caribbean Mediterranean.
The Caribbean Medeple was founded by an English stocking society in the head of Lesley Urkvarto in 1910.
In Soviet times this was important to the economy of the country, and it actually provided the livelihood of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, because of the financial problems, production has been resumed, leading to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakis medoplavil.
One of the main issues of the Caribbean occupation was also to be resolved: environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already well-known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was managed by the Russian media company.
The company began to modernise production, gradually reducing environmental load on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelabinian region of Boris Dubrovski, who visited the first number of July, Karabashmed.
The head of the South Ural called for the radical changes that have taken place since the time that Karabashmede has moved into the RMK group.
The major modernization activities of the Karabashmedi in recent years have been the construction of a new greenhouse gas station, which allows up to 99.9% of metallurgy gas.
According to the President of the Russian Media Company, the amount of investments in the project amounted to about 7 billion rubs.
The next phase of the modernization of the CARabashmed is the reconstruction of the conversion process.
The replacement of three converters, trailers, gas contract was planned at the end of 2017.
The project value is 2.5 billion rubs.
In addition, by the end of 2016 it was planned to launch a new cleaning of industrial goods at a cost of 1 billion rubs.
In turn, the amount of taxes calculated in the budget of the city of Karabash will increase.
For the entire period of implementation of the Tominian Goca project - from the start of construction and before the second round - the federal penalty will be 8.9 billion rubs.
As a result of the introduction of GMOs into the budget of all levels, there may be 80.9 billion rubs.
For the year of production in the Varnen region, the budgets at different levels are estimated at 346.3 million rubs.
And that's for the first year.
"The more the company works, the more the amount of the bills may be," added Valerie Ulanovski.
In the IPCC it was explained that in 2015, the tax deductions from the Micheive Goka were close to 1 billion rubs.
However, the participation of RFCs in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RFCs help to repair and maintain schools, children's gardens, sports facilities, to build cultural and recreational facilities, to benefit the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian media company in Karabakhe became a capital repair, and in fact, almost the complete refurbishment of N9 for 95 students.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.
Also in the territory of RMK Arena, a land-of-the-art, underground and underground parking lot is located in 600 cars, coffee and sports shops.
RMK Arena will be able to carry out exciting professional sports activities at the international level.
However, the main purpose of the project is to make physics and sport accessible to the inhabitants of Chelabinsk, primarily for children.

It was directed against China, but it could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be long, the issue is written.

Snapchat’s Effect Criticulates Asian Caricature
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by lightning, but some suspects say it is racist.
With the help of the Linza Snapchat tool, about 150 million users are able to change the reality of the day and to play in individual ways that limit the wear.
You can turn yourself into ananas, a dog or a person to take a picture of King Liechtenstein.
Lynseys are the roughest drawings of instruments that make up more than 30 million uncorrected cells a day.
Any mistakes will soon become public.
Snapchat's Linza was criticized in the past when accused of proclaiming the secret skin of the person or encouraging the distinguished as an ideal for beauty.
So when some users offered this week a lion, which gave their hair to the eyes, the teeth, and the lungs, some critics thought it was a racist character to Asians, "jeltolitics".
They also asked whether these repeated objections to the more serious issue of the company related to diversity were raised.
In the middle, communications were circulated and subsequently reported on The Verge and Motherboard, the following day after Snapchat stated that they had removed this function.
The company commented: Lynza was thought to be a respect for individuals, not as an Asian character.
However, experts who know of racism do not listen to, the lens has recalled disturbing stereotypes in action.
The others totally rejected the comparison.
In an e-mail letter to Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student of art whose tweets were actively engaged, said that the lens was "stricken and at least unwelcome".
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of the side of a very grave character on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just a jeltolitre, but at the highest level a destructive pellets.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
The American culture is an integral part of the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness from the corporate halls of meetings to Hollywood and the demons, which we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat - which is more racially diverse than their older generation - can mean that it is more likely to be understood.
When one of the Snapchat lines creates an image that is offensive to the user, Katy Ju said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old, "so it's going to be much harder to remain unmarked than it was before".
In Thursday, Ju, the production manager and the engineer working on the Medium, decided to remove his account in Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In an article for the Media and on the telephone, she said that racial differences were considered to be due to insufficient diversity in the collection of staff in Snepta.
Ju was critically critical of the company's leadership, consisting only of men and finished his article with the missing article: #DeleteSnapchat.
According to Juu, who is an American from China, he wrote: “They did not have enough in the state to make such decisions, or they were working with white people, but they did not take such positions as they could safely and openly express.”
Other suspects share her point of view, expressing discontent that Snapchat had not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state by stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but he said that the company had recently hired the Recruiter to focus on the insufficient areas of the population and on the active efforts to engage in domestic resources.
She said on her side that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding: "I'm interested in whether they really need more users than we are, so they can say that they won't go."
The Military Guide informed the IGIL, informs the Congress Committee
Officials of the Central Military Force of the United States have amended the disclosure reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which provides the basis for the events on the ground, reported to the Congress on the report issued in Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, organized by the chairpersons of the Board of Representatives of the UNCSC, the Disarmament Committee and the Sub-Committee on Military Provisions, revealed “a wide range of disparity” among the analysis of the intelligence service of the Central Command, which claimed that the leaders had conducted their assessment of American actions aimed at the conquest of the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the Center, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Research documents, approved by the Centre's High Command, usually gave more optimistic picture of the United States counter-terrorism actions than confirmed by actual data from the scene, and were more stable than the analysis provided by other services”, the news release said on the report.
"What has happened in the Centcoma is unacceptable: when the superior leadership seems to be an inadequate analysis, our soldiers suffer," said a member of the House of Representatives of Ken Calvert, a Republican of California.
The problems with leadership in Centecoma are reaching the highest level of the organization.
The 10-party reports provide detailed insights into the ongoing failure of 2014 and 2015 to describe and analyse American actions aimed at training the Iraqi Armed Forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain final evidence that the members of the Administration of Obama had ordered the falsification of reports, he claims that the analysts felt that the Center ' s leadership had forced them to submit a more optimistic view of the threat by the Islamic State, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command at the Congress were significantly more optimistic than the actual events,” the report reported.
For example, the Centcoma official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is a well-known possibility," said a member of the House of Representatives of Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command ' s highest intelligence service led the deployment of command documents to reduce the risk of IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that the analyses expressed concern that the disclosures about the Islamic State had been false.
As the investigation progresses, further disaggregated data are followed by a report published in Thursday.
In addition, the investigation by the Centre not completed at this time is conducted by the Chief Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party to the Committee on the Exploration of the Chamber of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, in accordance with some of the conclusions of the Republican operational group.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centre established an excessive closure of the investigation evaluation procedure on IGIL and Iraq's security forces," he said, in a statement by the Member of the House of Representatives of Adam B. Shipf, the main representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
According to the Shiffa, this procedure "stopped the issuance of disclosure documents", affected the moral state of the analysts and "not enough to reflect the cost-effective views".
But the Chiefs and Democrats claim that they have not found evidence that the White House has tried to discourage the analysts of the Centre to convince them of their conclusion under “a dedicated or political interpretation”.
The preliminary findings of the Congress were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of a investigation by the chief inspector of the Pentagon, who was found to be following the complaints of the Centcoma analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation of the chief inspector was continued.
He said, however, that “experts sometimes spend their views on the processing of comprehensive data, and the Department of Defence and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues of national security”.
The results of the investigation are due to the question of whether the goals of the United States-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now approves).
However, last year's statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama could rely on the Central Command to provide a true assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the Islamic State has echoed the controversy that occurred more than ten years ago when the analysis of the department of Centcoma Gregory Hucker wrote a research article stating that the administration of President George Ookera Bush had expressed support for the small number of troops in Iraq and had no idea what would follow in 2003.
Hukker also played a key role in the protest brought about by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hukker's team concluded that despite public feedback on the return, air carriers belonging to the Islamic State did not significantly undermine the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil-producing stations to sell oil on the black market.
However, the opening was not extended beyond the Central Command, as reported in the September Times newspaper.
The then Commander of the Center, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was critical in the past year after the testimony in the Senate, which many of the MPs considered extremely optimistic of the war.
General Austin withdrew in April and was placed in the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States has won four times in the female hockey field, thus approaching a decisive match with Britain
When she was hit by three holes in the matte, which was completed victory over Japan with account 6-1, Katy Bam opened the account on Thursday for the US Women's hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with account 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but BAM, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she ever did something like that.
"I'm not going to apply," she said.
I'm actually not one of the people who track their heads.
This is what she knows: the account of the Americans 4 to 0 in the Olympic tournament, and they are in the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unconquerable after the defeat of Japan with the account 2 to 0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim for a quarter-final, and the results of the game determine who takes the first place in their six teams and who is the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong opposition team from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, shortly after the games of the quarter-finals begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise of their unexpected series, four years after they took their last place among 12 teams in London.
Bam was on that command.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took the key to hockey on the farm when she was 3 (her older sister played in this kind of sport in Drexel), and joined a national gathering at the age of 16, and became her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not pass the final election tour.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammate did not like it.
The following year, Koig Parnheim, an English-speaking trainer, was appointed, and everything began to change.
"Culture change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
We had no productivity in London, which is now.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the account in the first half of the game with a short-distance hand.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprised and maintained account 1 to 0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long walk with a sword down the left side of the field, then after she went into the middle and quickly threw the sword into the ear, so she gave the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzales added a final round in the middle of the fourth period.
The "all" victory was the first in the tournament for the U.S. thief Jacky Briggs, who passed through one hole in each of the first three victories.
She's in shock.
Like bam.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnheim, but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympics, it's the day on the boat.
Wherever you are, no matter how much time you have now, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are said to be inconsistency and inevitable, a false combination of confusion and jealousy.
It's probably an Olympic fire, and it's the hot faeces that's going from the lighthouse to the gymnasium, to the triangular.
You can't include television, respect the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talking about coffee and not hear about Simon Bails, Katie Ledeki or about the enemy between Michael Phillips and Chad de Clo.
There's still Logan Dolly.
Dolls, the first in Olympic games, a dresser with sheep on the cheeks, could be among the characters that show in the premier timbres who promote sponsors and live advertising roles, if he was a hunter, gymnast, or even a fettocrat.
But 28-year-old Dolly from the town of Lake Forrest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympics on bats.
The Olympics don't know all the same things.
Far from the center, in part in the dark, there are those types of sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun shots, light shots, Badminton, tequiwondo.
Brass will always be with us, a long kingdom.
But if I'm allowed to say something in defense of my personal attachment, let me draw your attention to the humble smell of the shoes on the boat.
Although battalions are an Olympic sport since 2000, when they deploreed games in Sydney, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I questioned were not at the course, that they are not at all related to Olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States and sent sportsmen to the summit, they never won medals on the boat, and their sportsmen did not finish until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually make men's rewards, and Chinese and Canadians are women.
Don Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the shoes on the boots have the charm of an autsaider, especially because they are closer to the unscathed ear than the Olympic Games.
I have to admit here that I am not an expert, but an earthly enthusiasm.
They actually have the chemical potential — the caricature of endless drops — but also the experience of chemicals and water samples, the two types of sports that they primarily associate with themselves.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolyn", meaning "traplin for pumps in water".
Winners are attracted to a giant boat flying at nearly 30 feet and must carry out a series of acrobatic trains (revealing, winning and salt) to the final ground on the feet.
They are evaluated by performance, complexity and "time of flight", according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two sportsmen from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will meet in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is the front.
The medal players must go further, faster, higher and higher in gold after gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forward, right there in the field.
They strive not only to the finish line or to the start stage, but also to the television camera, to the other bright edge: the world or the Olympic record.
This intense effort is beautiful, dignified, even fantastic — and it is worth the effort to stop even the viewer.
But that's how I think it works when I'm looking at the game.
It's a little bit of a button.
Battista's direction is up.
Move forward - not purpose.
He or she jumps, as if it were an asteroid, flying up, then down, then with no effort to get up again.
And, of course, there are no competitions or difficulties, but throughout the programme there is no sense of ending, there are no long-distance, just a strange, time-consuming, and gravitational.
It's the closest to the day of the Olympics.
Women's qualifications, and then the final will go on Friday, the transition will take place on the day of the Eastern European era; the men will be on Saturday, and the men will also be on the clock.
NCBs will transmit the final under the agenda from 14:00 a.m. to 2 days.
A peaceful, beautiful moment is expected to be seen in the general bath.
And if awareness-raising can be achieved only by raising men's views and objectives, as Wall Street Journal has recently predicted, men's gymnasiums from the United States — Dolly only survives its new spring fantasium.
"Protestation" in Ethiopia, former United States Union
Prosperity Protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the Government.
It is obvious that dozens of protesters were killed during police interviews.
Is Ethiopia really on the edge of a school?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong Western Union with a rapidly developing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have devastated the country by expanding its territory.
Only in recent weeks have thousands gone to the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was cruel.
The observers claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos from protest sites, supposedly taken at the end of the year or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the project "African Red" in the international research group.
Ethiopia is the second most dense African country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa is receiving such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly — even a new garden trip to Addis Ababa’s capital.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, whether Ethiopia was a model of democracy, human rights organizations constantly mention governmental repressions, the opposition to the territory of the State has been halted by the fact that the dissidents have actually stopped.
Many of them were sent, imprisoned, killed or expelled in remote villages.
But it can change.
"If people constantly complain and leave no other option than to protest, there will be a rise," said Seyum Teshima, lecturer of the University in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the arrest of the government coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely intensified their opposition and now controls 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is growing; the fight against this uncertain, controversial border has led to hundreds of lives in June.
Analyticals are afraid that separatist groups that have been destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ugandan National Liberation Front, may try to use fires and weapons.
A number of factors explain why feelings of anger, which, in a few years, are deeply rooted, are now taking a toll.
First of all, it would be perfectly harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have a large number of Ethiopian people been able to meet in social networks, as mobile phones have become a trial, and Internet services have improved.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people are equally able to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, two major Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhar are not natural allies.
During the centuries of Amhara from the highly developed Christian high places in Ethiopia, many of them are Muslims and live in sub - Saharan Africa.
But that's also changing.
"We're going to do a message under the same start," said Mulat Gemech, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests have taken place in the Amhari and Oromo regions.
Many of Amhari and Oromo feel that members of the ethnic group in Ethiopia are unjustly dominated, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and policy.
A third reason for this is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee the danger.
Analyticals claim that he was particularly experienced in identifying the first signs of discontent and using investigators to obtain data and disengage the opponents.
"The current regime does not understand a healthy sense," Abdi said, an analysis of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Halimariam Desaljan, appeared nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tutra region in northern Ethiopia, the Himalayas are South.
Analyticals say that he is not using the trust of security services controlled by Tyre.
Many fear that this will result in further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia survived such a wave in 2005, after thousands of people protested against the fact that, as the analysts said, it was apparent that the government had chosen and then the results had been made.
During the post-repression period, many Protestants were killed, although the number was lower than in recent months, and the period of attacks was relatively rapid.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia's leaders for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as a new international journey and a significant success in combating poverty.
But it is evident that this has not been the result of an increase in internal discontent by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it's taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protestors in Honduras, the city of Amhar, attacked the companies belonging to Turkey, and anti-Turray hatred in social networks became a global one.
Analyticals claim that the protestors have put the United States and other Western Unions in a state of disillusionment.
The U.S. Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights to neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, he does not want his Union to lose its strength in an already unstable region.
"And it's going to be hard to get through this threatened can," said Abdi.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that the IGIL was based on Obama, "sarcasmo"
Donald J. Tramp tried to replace the last conflict, covering his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was wrong when President Obama and Hillary Clinton said several times this week that they were "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the candidate to act as President of the Republican Party to approach the American people.
It also set up its alternates, who tried to protect him during the period of war, in a state of non-compliance, as they had been able to explain the statements he probably did not have in mind.
In expressing this assumption at a meeting in the middle of the evening, Trump strongly appealed to his fourth statement, repeating in the interview that he was actually saying that President and Clinton had founded the IGIL.
But in the post at Twitter early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just exaggerating.
This post was a direct objection to the allegations made earlier on the day when the Trap said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his charge.
When Radio Conservative Hyhu Huyitt tried to help the Trapu to ease the statement, he reminded him that Obama wanted to destroy the IGIL, the candidate for the post of President of the Republican Party had not used the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trip tried to redirect his campaign to the economy on the basis of a rating reduction.
Tramp and Clinton spoke with the controversial issues about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Tramp again tried to return to this subject.
Once again he fled to Twitter, he insisted that Clinton's plans would increase taxes and said that she had heard something strange.
The tramp used a sarcoon as a excuse before.
Towards the end of July, after he went into general criticism, he gave the idea that Russians should corrupt Clinton's e-mail, and later he explained his comments, saying, "Of course, I'm joking."
This approach enables the Treaty to go beyond the allowed political word and take its words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing those or other communications that are repugnant to his worshipers, to see how they act, and then to "explain" them to some other side, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and he knows that they're quite excited to treat them differently.
Instead of smoothing the expressions for a large electric power, Trump took even more vulnerable tone in recent days, while his ratings continued to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist released on Friday showed that the Tramp was joining Clinton with a large movement in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and going with it to Florida.
Although Trump is usually trying not to apologize for the provocations he says, he often blames his criticisms in the wrong interpretation of his words and in the lack of understanding of his sense of humor.
However, as the Tempp has been an object of increased attention in the recent months of the presidential campaign, his attempts have placed his loyal allies in the wrong place: they have to support him publicly whatever provocations he has ever experienced.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former Mr. New York, who is one of the most famous supporters of the Trump, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," Juliani said, when he was asked about the authenticity of the Trumpa approval that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama IGIL was almost an unknown minority organization, he called it a non-prominent threat, which was absolutely unjust, and that is why everything happened because he took the army out of Iraq.
Most of the media republics are convinced that the administration of Obama, in which Clinton served as a State Secretary, has allowed IGIL to develop, as it was not possible to make the situation worse in the Middle East.
In the meantime, in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack on Twitter the means of mass information for the dissemination of each of his words and his presupposes.
He looked at the "poor unhappy" television experts trying to explain it and said, "They're weak!"
Some democracies have challenged the arguments of the Trampa as merely proof that he was not in favour of the Presidents.
Sometimes the hot coffee comes back to Greenpoint.
The Werb coffee was packed with only available places in Williamsburg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she got out of her apartment with a fever on Bedford Avenue.
The Soap Sherry store, which took place in Wireb in 2014, is sold in the form of cookies.
The locals complained about her as the last loss in the modern city.
Colonel Molly Crabapel wrote in Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I can't believe until then that CBGB is dead, Ot Chelsea is destroyed, and Werb has now become a honey store."
But while New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, up-to-date.
The Verb coffee plant was opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less in love than in the north of the original place.
The new Werbe has Wi-Fi and receives credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and they look like a simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
In the head of the new Verba, Sisko Rodriguez, an old coffeeman, who is the owner and manager of the new site.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to put him in a new place, he said he would be happy to go.
Rodriguez, who was 36 years old, left many behind.
Werb works with the same baseball distributor and bought the same model of coffee.
It even has an old Verba picture.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He proposed new flowers.
In the menu are sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are plenty of poppings from the cuppers or a hot hole.
There's a blue from the brown hair.
There's no more beer in the coffee, but now they're making fresh juices.
Nine months later Rodriguez said that he drew attention to the constant flow of older clients.
"Many former customers have also paid prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Olivier was one of those clients.
Olivier, who was 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and often visited Werb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she just got there.
After closing Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that the coffee and the atmosphere were impressing me at Verbe," she said.
Now she has another five coffees, although on that day instead of the usual coffee, she ordered a cup of tea, another newspaper.
Tom Rosental, another old client, visited Werb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same.
"In fifteen minutes eight, every day as in time, I came, and prepared for me my bicycle with oil and with all kinds of means," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new glasses in the menu.
Today, Rosental still makes the usual order, but sometimes he changes something with the help of a bacon, an egg, or a pigeon in every way.
Rodriguez said he wasn't trying to get the store into the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Sop Sherry offered to make a special treat for Verba, using coffee made of coffee in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree with their proposal," Rodriguez said.
The Permanent Residents of Greenpoint of Poland also loved the coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the streets so that his new neighbors would feel wanted.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for the sale of juices is intended to be separated by bottles and to sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is the possibility that the coffee would join the next building.
For many customers, it's enough that the new Werb will include their favorite blues in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a constant client and divided that he was killed by a storm when they closed.
When the coffee was opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this aroma?" he confessed.
Depressive eating of depression in the Red Cross
In March 1933, shortly after the President was born, Franklin Delano Rusvelt, the village of Oval, was to meet at the Oval office.
As a grunt, President Rusvelt loved the fashionable blues of the Fifth Avenue, for example, the Fau-game and the Meriland Cup.
His menu on that day was more modest: the eggs in the tomato juice, the potatoes powder and the dessert - powder from the blackberry.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cou, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to ask."
Wifes living in Brooklyn Heights are food professionals.
The last book of the Kowa, "Ragu More Chinese", was about a Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a quiet apartment in the Lower East Side by eating in his book Dom 97 on the street of the Fruit garden.
Their new joint work on the Red Cross, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
In some degree their own culinary solidarity, they met with a volunteer reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a short lunch in the Flyteron Square, which has been working since 1929, in the Black Sea.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a sleigh cheese and butterboard with olive juices, and Kou, 57, took the Indic, Cartophile powder and sweet cheese.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered this an appropriate starting point for discussion on food in the period of Depression.
"Royettes used a lot of questions," said Zigelman.
There was an Aarasis root, a peacock root, a bubous root.
They were made from the main ingredients and the ingredients that allowed the ingredients to grow.
Imagine that you've eaten as much rice as you need to eat.
Who's sick.
"He must have been in a mad stone," he said.
Years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women's groups were prepared for farm workers, and the freshly-stained pirogue was placed for breakfast, lunch and lunch.
That's why the Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The Red Cross describes how the country managed to end the country's drought.
"It was the time when food became a central, not simple topic for Americans," said Kou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
It was also not easy to make a new budget: forgetable blues, such as rollers and capturings, became the main food products; the trapping is a “precious way to dry clothes”, said Zigelman, because the dishes could stop unappetuous ingredients under a hot sauce.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by fresher fruit.
The meat, which has been the basis of an ancient American diet for many years, has become an economically distributed plant.
People have tried strange mixes because energy and nutrition values have become more important than food and even a culinary health concept.
By doing research for a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared the blue of the era: a sealed glass of rice oil.
"This addition to the combined table was not successful," said Kou.
Zigelman added, "It was very strange."
Arasis oil is totally out of touch with oil.
This was natural for many household recipes.
As never before and ever since, house - to - house professionals, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Housing from 1923 to 1943, have managed the food habits of the country.
In public recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to be “budget bearers”, to accept challenges and to convert the burden of the species of lost coral reefs into delicious leaves.
"Plot trapeze" is the premise of popular historical facts.
Especially interesting are reports on the Government's reaction to hungry citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Guvera in the spirit of "let them eat pirogues".
A simple farm truck in the state of Iowa during his childhood, he asked himself as a Western millionaire.
"He liked the continental cuisine, for example, fish with a bitter sauce," said Kou.
He was practically in a buried table, hoping to shine.
He was fantastically removed from reality.
President Roosevelt could make the same mistake if his wife did not encourage him to give him an example of his own jealousy.
As stated in the book, Eleanor Rusvelt introduced an economy that was totally not interested in taste, and this led to the fact that the White House “used not only to waste food in Washington, but also to be prepared at times. ”
Many of the colonial adoptions of the era of Depression have been forgotten as long as the country again stood on its feet.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Zigelman, and how science has been used to produce food.
The husband says that during the writing of the book, they better understood the traditional diet of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not choose food, for example.
"She was deeply afraid of the unfathomable relationship here," said Kou.
Zigelman recalls, "She's been on a full-scale show of people."
It was one unpleasant case with the profiltories.
When the trucks in Eisenberg's were deserted, they and Kou got a dessert that they prepared at home: a dessert from the snowflake, which President Rusvelt went to dinner.
"It's called a black mouse," said Zigelman, adding that it was a widely distributed reception - to give the modest recipes of the broccoli names.
The killed were not just cold, a little pain, sugar, water, and corn.
The whole thing was loaded with a bed in a velvet, slender, missing substance.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
He asked for more than twice.
He said, in the voice of a trusted budgeter, "The woman would not have mixed a piece of Greek ruby here."
The arrest of figures on the mass drama at the Hovans Square was extended until 14 November
The Presnese Court left the case of the mass drama at the Hovan Taberate until 14 November, in accordance with the relevant request for a follow-up.
In the case, 14 persons were convicted.
It is recalled that on 14 May, a mass strike occurred at the Hovan camp of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with weapons that killed three people.
The former librarian leader, Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization, Alexander Bocarnikov, had been charged with murder.
The second issue for 2016 indexation of pensions can be resolved within the next two or three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-President of the Government of RF Olga Golodez reported this during a visit to the Bransk area.
We have specific parameters to increase pensions in order to reduce inflation in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now the economists are running out of the weekend, and we'll finish this job for the next two or three weeks," says the Globe Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed head of the Centre for Strategic Development, Alexe Kudrin's plan for increasing pension age per year, the Vice-President reported that the topic was not discussed in the cabinet.
At the end of July it was announced that the Government had agreed to the full index of pension payments in 2017.
Stone and Grigorian have gone to the end of the shooting of a small-caliber window.
Russian sportsmen Sergei Kamenski and Cyril Grigoryan have gone to the end of the shooting of a small-caliber window from the position of the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to the TASS, Sergei Kamenski took 629 balls and took the first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualification.
Cyril Grigorian became the second - 628.9.
Eight better athletes have gone to the end.
The stone is a world record in this discipline (633).
The Turkish opposition, Fethulla Gulen, called for an international investigation of the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I demand that the independent international commission investigate the attempt to convert the State," said Guilena, French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also stated that "if any of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Guillen denied participation in the referendum, stressing that his organization had never appealed to the political authority.
The Stambula court had previously arrested an opposition Islamic preacher, Fethullah Guilena.
We remember that the military conversion attempt took place in Turkey from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies reimburse the costs of legal services during the dispute for a patent from hepatitis C with Merck
The company Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to recover the costs of legal services that it has incurred in connection with the burden of the patent on hepatitis C with Merck & Co Inc, the Federal District Court.
In June, the Gilead company was exempted from the payment of $200 million for the violation of the two Merck patents related to the drugs of the Gilead company, the sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge discovered several violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical proceedings.
At the trial in the fourth case, U.S. Federal District Court judge Bet Lebson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to repay the costs incurred during the search.
The Merck company is trying to attract Gilead, which dominates the market for new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can treat more than 90 per cent of patients with cancer.
The case was held in 2013, when the Gilead and Merck companies brought each other to court, and declared their rights to the laboratory work based on the sophosbuvir, an active ingredient of the Gilead medicine.
The armed forces established with the support of the United States claim that they have taken full control of Manbyjem in the Islamic State
The armed forces established with the support of the United States had been fully controlled by the northern city of Manbij with Turkish borders, after the last remaining members of the Islamic State were gone, the representative of the group was informed on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after the disappearance of the remaining group of fighters who have been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilians detained by the fighters, informing the Reuters agency, Charfan Darvis, of the association with the Manbyja Military Council.
"The city is now under our control, but we are doing clean-up operations," he reported to the Reuters agency.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal taxes
Hillary Clinton made its 2015 tax statements on Friday, which showed that the candidate in the presidential democratic party and her husband had $10.75 million in this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in voluntary contributions, mainly in the Clinton Fund, the former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in the form of statements, and the former Secretary of State claimed that Simon & Schuster had received $3 million in her book on her residence in the State Department.
potential Vice-President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Cain of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, made tax statements for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillar Clinton and Tim Cain continue to set a standard of financial transparency," said Chief Advisor Clinton Jennifer Palmer.
In full opposition to them, Donald Tramp was hiding behind some excuses and breaking his previous promises to detect his tax declarations.
This is an ordinary case for candidates in the United States to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them.
The New York businessman Tramp and his lawyers called for a review of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to disclose his tax declarations.
"You're going," wrote the Advisor to Twitter, the head of President Clinton Jan Sams, in the form of a statement by the Democratic Party's candidate.
On Thursday, the Special Adviser to Trampa Michael Coin told CNN that it would not allow the Trampa to issue them before the end of the inspection.
Critics of Trampa, including a candidate from the Republican Party in 2012, said Mitta Romni and other fellow Republicans had rejected his situation, his favourable contributions, his business operations and other connections, including Russia.
Clinton got caught up in this issue and released an online video on Friday, where the main source of information was to the Republicans who had convinced the Trapa to find a tax account.
On Thursday, she raised this issue at the time of the economic debate in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate has done for ten years without exception: to detect his tax declarations," she said to the assembled.
The Political Journal reported that the Tempp paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business prosecutor quoted many tax lawyers and librarians on Friday, who thought that the case might have been so far.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of debate in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule called a billionaire, investor Warren Buffet, which would ensure that people who receive more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omahe, in the state of Nebraska, Buffet, where the Berkshire Hathaway Conglomerate was based, suggested that the Temppu should meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffet said he was also under IRS verification, and that the Tramp was not a tax collection agency, but the voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters had issued tax declarations by 2007.
Clintons currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 statement showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, and Clinton announced dividends and income from the capital of $109,000.

Conservatives with light steel and firemen increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
The Tanzanian environmental boats use a non-traditional way of blending the forests into the public places, where the condoms filled with sandy sands are pumped.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, along with the American Committee on the Conservation of Nature, took the initiative to train volunteers in the northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step approach to protecting their homes and homes without causing harm to animals.
Many have used copies to protect themselves.
On Friday will be the Day of Judgment for the Protection of Animals.
"Since we have created a set of instruments ..., we are seeing changes in the relations within these communities, and as a result they are increasingly convinced that they can not leave elephants in their fields without causing injuries," said Executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bell.
The first two steps are in front of the breaching line and signalling with the help of the wheel.
If he didn't get scared, they're breaking what's called a "blade chili."
The cheetah mixed with soil is placed with a stick in the container, and its end is closed, and the leaves remain only phytillas.
When the container is burned, it is heated with a stopper, and a small powder of powder is poured into the air.
It's usually enough to blow the hole on the other side.
The outer layer is a light device that shoots Roman lights into the air, producing a huge, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country after the referendum in July this year.
Such data were brought to the head of the IMD of Turkey by Melvult Chavoshoglu in the absence of local journalists.
At the first stage, we called 208 diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of them, 32 persons have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish Foreign Policy Office.
We remember that in July Turkey a State conversion attempt was made.
The authorities officially stated that the governor had disappeared and reported that more than six thousand people had been detained, including the military forces of the high and medium name.
As a result of the experiment by the host, 290 people were killed, according to the IMD of Turkey.
The Jewish Director strongly criticised the Berlin office for removing Israel's telephone code on "abs" — reported the RT News channel
The French director of Jewish origin launched a scandal in the media, discovering that Kempinski Bristol in Berlin does not have a list of Israel's telephone code, which calls to "questions" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of a documentary film on Holociste Shoa, expressed his discontent with the Kempinski Bristol department in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay in Lanzman, Israel tried to find a list of the telephone codes provided by the department.
The country, however, was not mentioned among States where it could be called directly from the room.
How did it happen that in 2016, the capital of New Germany, Israel, was excluded and deleted?
He wrote Lanceman.
The Kempinski Bristol replaces Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In the search for explanation, the director raised the issue at the end of the board's administration.
The answer he got there, says Lanzman, "he shot him."
Clarke of the Hospital said that this measure was "a sensible decision to guide Kempinski's network."
The reason behind this step was even greater anger of the director.
"Most of our Arab guests, and they needed Israel's code to be removed," said Lanzman, a fireman.
The Israeli envoy Jacob Hadass-Handelsman in Germany called the case "a terrible sight", reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were hit and shocked by the incident.
It's, in fact, a terrible sight.
The fact that this happened in Germany, and that is, in this network of hotels, is even greater.
There's no need for explanations here.
We expect the hospital to make the right conclusions," said the officer.
The case called for a little rationalization on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that Mr. Kempinski was simply "passing on" the alleged demands of Arab clients.
“They would sit down, ” said another post, indicating that the hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street was surrounded by a synagogue.
The Otel himself rushed to remove any charges, calling the "unexpected" and "proclaimed" before Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order that Israel should not be included in the Quick Collection List," quoted by the representative of the Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code is now added.
The police use exhaust gas and resonants against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the city of San Paulo on Thursday, when they were gathered to protest against government reform of the public education system.
The police used exhaust gas and resonants against protestors.
The riots began when police officers tried to fire the students, resulting in the use of rabies and exhaust gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concern about plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributiond to save money.
Some of the parties to the protest could be seen writing on the charts addressed to President Michael Temer ' s temporary responsibilities.
This last protest took place a few days after the mass protesters entered the street to support foreign President Dilmo Russef when the country's Senate voted for her impression.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 per cent — reports RT Business Portal
With the cancellation of sanctions, the supply of goods between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador, Lebanon Jagaran.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest of Russian business companies in the country has been seen growing.
Russian companies relink with Iran, and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the supply gap between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports in Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” said the messenger.
Jagaran also predicts that this year Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mainly to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran was the first to reach the top 20 countries on the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It can be said with confidence that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be killed," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which is expected to change.
"I personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jezed, where memories of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to shut down the barriers to the defence-industrial complex.
As a result of the "systematic failure" of the direction of the director of the Almaz-Antey concert, "workouts" and "lost confidence".
The head of NGOs has been appointed Gennadi Benderski for the next three years.
Information on the release of Nescorrodova appeared only on Thursday evening and did not give rise to a broad rationale in the media.
What can be explained by such a silence in terms of the large arms crossing of the army?
More recently, the leadership of the IMF does not want to spread any audiences or negative public opinion.
This alone confirms that there are many problems in the defence-industrial complex (OPC) and that the State does not want to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of the Inquiry is undoubtedly an important event in terms of the sectoral order.
Almaz is the main enterprise of the concert, which specializes in the production of the marine and ground-based zynetic complexes (SPCs).
At present, Almaz is working on the establishment of the Polymen-Redout and Morphee, which is planned to be established on new curves, frigates, symmins and creezers.
The founder of the Military Russia port Dmitry Cornev believes that the release of the Necrodov is due to a short period of time on these projects.
This version is the most logical one.
For example, the development of Morphea began in 2007, and the introduction was strictly anticipated in 2013.
"Poliment-Redut" must be the main system of PFO on new VMF ships.
According to the information I receive, none of the tests have been carried out for several years.
The truth is, as far as I can judge, there is no single "Almaza" guilt, Cornev said.
The expert is afraid that the delay in the operation could also be caused by C-500.
The pilot construction work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016, the first sets have to be held in the army.
They believe that "the work is being planned and will all be completed within the established deadlines", although in 2014 the Department recognized that there were problems with the development of C-500.
It is difficult to assess the professional qualities of Nescorodov, led by Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that the cuts in project time could be both the cause and the reason for the release.
In his view, it has been extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in OPC and business management plans.
The sector has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money are, of course, loved by silence.
As a rule, the director of the defence companies shall leave positions on their own terms, under the agreement of the parties, or be transferred to another work.
In this case, the removal was made public, although no justification was given.
This suggests that Almaza's leader may have been a strutish figure and was opposed to the "disorders".
In all, the State is no longer intended to be at peace with such conduct.
With the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to dispute with the Minboron institutions and do not perform the tasks assigned to them.
At the same time, the IMF's leadership seeks to punish the corrupt managers (the "Star").
The President is personally paying attention to the sector's problems.
Vladimir Putin led the Military Industrial Commission and held periodic meetings on arms transfers.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPC managers, seeking to have the legal composition of directors who will carry out the above-mentioned orders.
This was far from ideal policy, but it was based on corruption and the lack of normal competition in OPCs other instruments in the State.
The situation in the armored, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates Kremlin as soon as possible to lead to armed forces.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of the OPCC managers, the RIF leadership has taken full steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian army.
The military personnel acquired a new quality with the arrival of Minister for Defence Sergei Shoogu.
It is surprising that the President has taken a famous mention of the “Peace – Be Ready for War” on the armed side.
During the Cold War, the military forces of the SCR and the nuclear parity achieved in 1970 led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which strengthened the continent's impact on the continent.
In all the shortcomings of the Bipolar system, she worked well.
The absence of war on the European continent and on the stability of the Middle East has been evidenced.
The “victims” market in the cold war has thus turned to strengthening international terrorism.
After a series of tracts in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", please, there was no peaceful angle.
Despite the overall disaster, the West refuses to speak with Russia at the level of equal partners.
Under such conditions, our country's only allies remain a fleet and an army.
The strengthening of military power will make Moscow more effective to stop national interests and get to the new borders of world policy.
Scotlandn Kallum Skinner sleeps on the finish line, resulting in the British capture of the bicycle gold
Schotlandez Kallum Skinner started to trimphus in a man's command ring on the bike last night in Rio, resulting in the protection of his title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old teacher of Glazgo was in the role of the strongest one his friend, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and a young proud man went into the story, running on the finish line to win the New Zealand Army.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, won when Hoy declared the right to a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick, after they had graduated from the six world champions of March in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was replaced by a specialist in Jamie Staff.
They did so as once when the Hindus appeared.
In addition, Hoya has created a waste that Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton have tried to fill.
Skinner was a man with British coaches who saw the potential in Scotland that was now realized.
Hendez, Kenny, a champion with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner established an Olympic record of qualifications, but the rule was passed on to New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold medal.
Hendes was right behind his circle, but Kenny got the team ahead, and Skinner supported it.
The change of the strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hendez went on a larger transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
She watched from her place as an invited BBC expert and took a look at Skinner, Kenny, and Hendez when they entered the pedagogue.
23-year-old Skinner from Glazgo said, "That's a simple comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make my name.
We set up an Olympic record in the finals and won the peace champions.
That was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012 along with Kenny and Hoy, Hendez admitted that he had deliberately fallen onto the track after a failed start.
It was later dismissed from the commentary, and it was not possible to appeal by British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hedes said, "I felt like London, with all those British tribune flags."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We have lost so many run-ins with the world name that winning the Olympics again was just boring.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 designated gangs both in Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bike will wait for another five days.
In the form of Kenny's demonstration, it is not beyond the opportunity to show how he repeats Hoya's move, he won three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would show how Kenny, a 12 - year - old Hoa, also born on March 23 (that is, the sacred date of the British sports, also known as the day of the birth of Steve Redgray, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), brings his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It would be the same as Hoya.
The next time Kenny gets up in the morning, he starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Commands are always the best.
You come to win with your friends.
A little alone to win one if it's true.
Hedes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he's got to get a kingdom."
It was only for the medallion day, but there were the following good news for Britain.
Ser Bradley Wiggins, Ed Klünsey, Steven Burke and Owen Doll have been qualified as the fastest four-mile-mile-dull command race.
They graduated at 3:51.943.
The 2012 World Report on Gold Winning in London is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today on the second day of the event where Wiggins will be in the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, an invitation to a qualifying mission, when the officials needed him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women's activities, which are resumed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Russell Shend, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milangavi, improved the world record at 4:13.260.
Britain ' s command has come to rely on a possible crew of bicycles to take on the middle of the Olympic Games and to hire medals.
After the very exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas on the second floor, not the last, the departure from the technical director, Shane Satton, in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the treatment of large figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first night’s ride on the bike, it is said that the legendary glory of Great Britain is now at the top when it is necessary, perhaps once again.
Future Portland Metallurgy Corps in Threat due to the breakdown of the electricity contract
The future Portland Aluminum Company in Victoria, as well as hundreds of jobs, is threatened by the fact that an electronic energy company providing a facility, according to one of its owners, is going to break down a supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be broken down.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the profession.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened by Alcoa in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can be at risk as a result of any closure.
Additional side effects can also be seen as the metallurgy plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgy plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
The Portland metallurgy plant Alcoa loses money and is in danger of closing.
These actions have been the result of thinking about the future of a profession that has continued for several years, which is due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and, later, because of the prices for the production of a job.
The AGL company, which provides a large aluminium plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latbob Valley, reported that it is expected that three other owners will also take steps to break the contract.
The controlling part of the project belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Aluminum, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubine Corp are less.
"AGL company expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, the physical demand for electricity by the metallurgy industry will not cease," she said.
According to the AGL company, the contracts mentioned are so-called 'managed contracts' that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of separation, so they are actually ending in 2017.
"Of course, AGL’s company still expects these contracts to bring its share of income in the financial year 2017," said the electronic energy company.
In any case, any potential impact on AGL's assets has been limited from the financial year 2018 at this time by the projections on the strong market for electricity prices.
The company AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its report to $187 million in the form of “pre-existing breakdown”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to split contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to manage a metallurgy plant or to provide electricity to a metallurgy plant".
The American company stated that in 2010, it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang that was to enter into force in November of that year, but it still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
The analysts feared possible closure of both the Portland metallurgery profession in Victoria and the Tomago profession with Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Turning to analysts earlier this week, AGL CEO Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megabytes of energy each year, while Tomago is about 900 megabytes a year.
If both of these jobs are marketed, a significant reduction in market demand [electronics] is taking place.
It's going to be bad for us as a manufacturer."
Not only the stars of the Cartagena, Candall on the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, a model and fourth daughter of Cardian Jenner, the mother manager of Chris, appeared on the front page of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand member of the Estee Lauder brand, and who has co-founded fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his account in Instagram on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my dear people, I looked at this bed and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news of the situation was strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardian family?), produced a video project in which all the Cardian Jenner family (debosser Rob and Caitlin, also accompanied by the most beloved business fathers, founder of the Cardian family, Ryan Sykrest), forgot about the appearance of the sister on the scene, and at the end of the classic revolution: they planned a party of Surprises.
This is the standard binding line for almost all episodes of child television shows on birthdays (Sikrest makes a phrase: "Did you think we had forgotten about you?" with a genuine multi-day queen from the program on 8th of the morning), but Chris needed to get this fame as well or otherwise for other girls.
Because with this episode, about the September issue of Vogue, we have no doubt entered the new era of Cardian show.
Let her older sister, Kendall Kim, fallen on the floor of Vogue earlier (she appeared on her face with her husband, Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue was a self-containment.
The September issue is the most sold edition of Vogue per year.
A full look on the tax issue rather than on the fashion magazine attracted a large number of advertising ads (by the fashionista port, 615 pages from the previous 832 pages were placed on the advertising page).
The news of the star falling on its surface is expected to be such that in the last two years, the photograph of the magazine has fallen to the official anonymity.
Among the former women who fell on the floor were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more "studyers who work by models" than "models who are nominalists".
Laurent's Oskar Awards and brand-name Dior Jennifer Laurences was presented on the platform in 2013, a year after this honour was drank by Lady Gage.
But even in that small case, if Jenner, who described the magazine as a “extraordinary model ” of his generation, falls into the first category, she is in a bad company.
These are not relatives of famous people, star stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat.
They are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Bayonse, which appeared in the past year, this year was one of the most successful in the career with the release of Lemonade album.
Of course, not all are happy with Jenner's success.
The situation of Jenner in the world of fashion, because of her past TV show, has always been a shock.
In June, one of the first models Victoria's Secret Stéphany Seymour described Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, calling them "sucking moments".
These settings were rebuffed after the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue area.
But it doesn't make sense.
Candall Jenner on the September number.
It is a supermodel in all the meanings of that word.
She's defending Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a ton of ice cream from Estee Lauder.
She, although all of her sisters, sells her photos in her own applications available on the payroll.
She sells photos of the daughter of Cindy Crowford of the LOVE magazine.
And in free time, perhaps to still see her sister, Cortney and her children, she's on TV.
Public legal centres have declined to serve 160 000 persons per year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the minimum protection representatives of the population refuse to serve in the public legal centres, as this sector is preparing for the impact of further funding on and so on.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to fight injustice and who are still in need of legal assistance and representation — have been denied.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope are being prepared for further reductions.
Since June the next year, these legal centres have had to lose 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Public Legal Centres of Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the recent census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not cancelled, the situation would only deteriorate.
“The main legal centres in Queensland have always received insufficient funding: that is, thousands of people are denied the essential services they need,” he said.
People from violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and complex debt, family members who have been divorced and who have been unjustly fired, all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government will fund 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that fewer than thousands of the protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland George Brandis to immediately cancel these cuts in funding so that people can receive the necessary help when they are faced with legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State had fulfilled its obligation to raise funding for free legal assistance to the country ' s average indicator.
Now is the time to focus on the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palašuk is ready to engage in this important work.
Donald Trampa was brought to court at the pre-election headquarters, after allegedly threatened by a gunman.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trampa was brought to court at the pre-election headquarters: it is claimed that the headquarters did not take anything after it was reported that his operational director in North Carolina threatened the gunman when they were in a shelter in February.
The incident was described in a case-by-case appeal filed in the State court at Charlotte Vincent Bordini, former programmer at the State Pre-election headquarters.
Bordini said that she had spent several months trying to solve the problem in an internal way, but he realized that "that's not going to happen."
Director Erl Phillip "takes the gun, puts his right tip on the hook and puts it on Vincent's knee pocket," Bordini admits in his complaint.
Appealing to the local and regional management of the pre-election headquarters, Bordini understood that at least four others had been involved in similar incidents with Philip.
"The guns don't have to shoot to hurt," Bordin said in a complaint.
The search took place two days after a candidate from the Republican party produced a forum, told the North Carolina audience that “people of the Second Amendment” – understood as the owners of arms and their loved ones – could begin to act if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and could elect judges.
The Trampa Premier said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini requested compensation from the Pre-election headquarters for non-border control and from Phillipa for the threat of physical violence, abuse of action and the cause of moral damage.
The representative of Trampa Hoop Hicks has been briefed by the response to the request to comment.
Trying to talk to Philip did not work out.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip recently left the pre-election headquarters.
In response to the call to his consultancy firm, the Innovative Consulting Services, no one called immediately.
The candidate from the Republican party, Donald Tramp, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-13300, General Court, Office of the High Court of the District of Meklenburg, Charlotte.
Britain must send the Olympic Spirit to the required root and expand Hitler
Hytru will also bring restoration and prosperity not only in our current human settlements and in general around London, but throughout the country.
Like me, it was the great privilege of Hitler, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to benefit our peoples and regions from the Game.
The Olympic Games have benefited greatly from Stratford and East India.
And we're doing this again, creating opportunities for local residents and a company with Hitler.
Only for our current population, we will create 10,000 new stations, 40,000 new jobs and the end of youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case before London 2012, those who believe that Hitler's expansion is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would be in a difficult position on the world scene.
Sceptics have failed in 2012 and will prove to be wrong about Hitler.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitrou is responsible for any issue he has to deal with.
Like the Olympic Games of Hitler, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a beautiful team in Hitro, which has introduced the 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and within the budget, from T5 to T2, selected by the best airport terminal for five years, to T2 built in the middle of the world's two largest airfields.
They are now ready to provide a third air-conditioning area of 16 billion private investment funds.
The Olympic Games in London 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am confident that the expansion of Hitler will also take place.
The time has come for us to send the Olympic Spirit to the necessary role and to expand Hitler, to secure our trade future, and to create the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing in "Cocks" about blocking advertising
For companies who earn money on the Internet, attempts to cover software for blocking advertising are a game in the "catches" of a company that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was about to block the advertising blockers on its website version, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block the advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the site's table version would change its area of advertising so that the bloggers would find it more difficult to identify which parts of the pages are advertising.
But Adblock now says he could sell a new code.
In his blog post, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “a kind of mutual struggle between the community of bloggers with an open source code and those who try to cover it continues from the time of the publication of the advertising block” and that Facebook might present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has taken up the fight is a clear indication of how serious the problem has become the blockade of advertising for industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people are using advertising blockers, according to the past year's study of Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users on Facebook via mobile devices, the mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of Facebook's income.
However, the company is interested in blocking advertising on the table, as mobile advertising blockers are not effective in the Facebook mobile apps for the social network and the Instagram, as the representative said.
However, the announcement in the so-called version is an income item enough to make Facebook take this step in a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was about to update its "advertising preferences" tool to give people more control over how the advertising is being placed on them.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were alarming, as they would also block some non-adjustment content on the site.
"It will not be a positive experience for people, and we intend to solve this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
The advertising blockers are a serious tool, so we have focused on creating tools such as the Advertising Preferences to transfer control to people's hands.
Women moved to Switzerland's highway in an apparent suicide episode
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after several vehicles were transferred to the highway early on Thursday in a manifest attempt to kill themselves.
The incident occurred on the A1 bridge of the Sea in Canton soon after midnight in Thursday.
The woman was lying on the street in the darkness of "a deep hope" and hit several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
Apparently, the victim, a Swiss woman 49 years old, was killed by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several intruders have already questioned, but the identity of some have not yet been established, reported to the police, calling on them and to anyone else who was a witness to the event.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in this situation, was initiated by counsel, Jille Hoffstetter Le Tribine de Geneve.
However, it still needs to be made clear whether any of the leaders involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the attack?
This is what the prosecutor must determine," said Hoffstetter.
Two other similar cases over the past five years have suggested that drivers would not be recognized as responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a person walking in the darkness on the highway — a judgment was made that car drivers cannot wait for an accident meeting on the highway during the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was sentenced to death because of the carelessness she had suffered after she had hit and killed a man at the A1 Piern train in August 2014.
22-year-old chicken victim and lost consciousness on the road, listening to the court.
The court found that a police woman, who responded to extreme challenges, managed a vehicle that was justified and that the human being on the road was “very exceptional and unforeseeable”, the judge said.
Any person who has information on the event in the fourth direction of the Sea shall call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
Venera, perhaps when it was usual, is based on the assessment of the new NASA climate model.
Students from the Goddarda Institute of Space Studies developed a model for the study of previous Venus using tools and algorithms, such as those used by climate technologies.
The model was developed to determine whether it could be found in Venezuela, with its hot waterless surface and atmosphere, which has been contaminated by carbon dioxide, whenever conditions such as soils exist.
The students had previously assumed that the small rate of Venezuela’s return was due to its flat atmosphere.
However, the latter model suggests that Venera may have had a depleted atmosphere like that of the earth and may have returned slowly.
The model also considered the topography of earlier Venezuela.
The planet is probably more complex than the Earth, but sometimes it has enough water and sufficient geographical variation to create conditions for life and prevent rapid recovery.
The early Venezuelan sun was also used, which was 30 per cent apart.
"According to the GISS model, the slowing return of Venerre puts her sun on her daily side almost two months a day," explained a communication to the student of GISS Anthony Del Heno.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a deep layer of clouds that acts as a zone that protects the surface of the planet from the material part of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures, which, as a surprise, are a few degrees cooler than in our day on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that was previously assumed by planetary experts.
Despite the fact that Venera may have been afflicted, it has been affected by too much noise and ultraviolet radiation over the course of several billion years.
Its oceans were parted, and its water pair was excavated by ultraviolet radiation.
When her water flowed, only a flat atmosphere left of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse effect remained — it is Venezuela, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venezuelan climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy declines the position of trainer of the Avalanche team
Patrick Roy left the post of the coach and vice-president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, noting the lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice-president / Chief Commandant, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noted that the club would start looking for a new trainer immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice-president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the summer, I had a long and serious thought about how I could improve this team to give her the depth she needed and raise her to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and the vice-president of hockey activities must be ideally consistent with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
Sakik, who ran Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we want him to succeed in the future.
Roy became the winner of Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the league during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 and won the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of playoffs and lost playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season, and for five hours it withdrew from the Wild team in the fight against a second profitable route to the Western Conference.
The doorkeeper in the Hall of Glory, Roy won four Cuban Stanleys — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil is renewed in negotiations and ceases to freeze
The work of the North Sea oil pay gap has been halted, and all sides of the discussion have entered into a new round of negotiations, reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
The fires against the oil company Wood Group were organized on a sporadic platform in the North Sea, held in Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unions of the Unit and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," said a joint statement.
We will hold a few meetings a whole day for the next few weeks, beginning with the next week to look at the problem with a fresh perspective.
The unions reported that their recent action, which, they said, was the first over 25 years old, was directed against potential payment reductions by up to 30 per cent.
In this year, the Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract servants working in the North Sea, about 9 per cent because of the negative market pressure.
The decrease in rates by the company occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in rates for contract workers on the market in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would give it the space needed to overcome market losses.
The Shell company, by its side, has reduced thousands of people and has announced plans to stop the oil activities in countries by up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities by means of its media with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low prices for raw oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision to leave the European Union, which was adopted in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with the trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the greatest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our time.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for the majority, not just for some," he said.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, compared with an average of approximately $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measured the speed of the star's return to the landscape
The last mission of space telescope Kepler has helped astronomers to collect the full directory of the return of the stars in the Plajad.
New data enable astronomers to understand why the planets return at different speeds, as well as the periods of rotation relate to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that compared our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of stars, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luis Riball, a researcher at the Centre for Infrared Treatment and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The planet is located in 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars are now only mature; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're coming back as fast as they'll ever be.
At its peak rate, these rising stars emit a great amount of star wind.
Traveling through the magnetic field of the stars, these winds provide the stars with a corrosive effect.
As the stars get older, the speed of their return starts to slow down.
Kepler measured the speed of the return of each star, following the time between the appearance of known stars — such as the sun’s rays.
The new rate of return is expected to be lower than that of mass bonds.
Riball compares the stars with the dancers: the pirates do more slowly than the smaller ones.
"In the "Battle" Paradise, we see that those who return slowly, usually more massive, whereas those who return faster, usually belong to very light stars," said Ribbal.
Just as the Plejad is so close, it serves as an ideal space lab to compare its connections with the speeds of return.
"Plaeda's outer layer provides a direct point for theoretical models of the return of the stars, both young and old," said Ribbal.
We still want to know much more about where and why the stars slow down their return and push their "tancular tufs" on the train, as I say.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their final analysis of the speed of the return of the Plejad in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
A survey involving the activities of a group of Ukrainian dissidents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is conducted by two departments, by Commersant.
The FSB collects evidence of the participation of those who are detained in the preparation of the variances in Crimea.
As noted earlier, the Ukrainian city ' s inhabitants, Energodar Evgeni Panov, agreed to cooperate with the prosecution, provided evidence.
According to him, as a dispersion facility, he considered the Titanium in Armenia, the neutebaz in Fedosia, the Kercenian paramour, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military aircraft.
It is believed that arrests have taken place far away from all dissidents.
This, in particular, was the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Sifrepole district.
Stanislav Cherchesov, head of the Russian football club
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint the Chief Training Officer of the Russian Federation on the football team Stanislav Cherchesov.
The contract will be calculated for two years before the end of the CM-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS appointed the Chief Training Officer of the Russian Federation on Stanislav Cherchesov football.
He was a well-known football player, who had previously played in Moscow 'Spartake' in the backyard position, as well as a master of Russian teams such as Spartak, Zemchugina-Sochi, Treek, Amkar, Dinamo, and Warsaw's Legii, who became the winner of national sovereignty and the country's Cup.
It is reported that the contract with the Church will be signed in the near future and calculated for two years.
Thus, he has the responsibility to prepare for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romašenko, Gintaras Stóuche, Vladimir Panikov, will enter his training headquarters.
There is information on which the total fee of the train station is 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the MFI, the RFS led to Stanislav Church's objective of bringing Russia together to the semi-final and to conquer the medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considered the creation of a competitive environment in the team and decided to give footballists the opportunity to show themselves.
And, according to Cherchesova, he's glad he's having a choice.
The first meeting under the leadership of the Church of Russia will be held on 31 August in Antalia, which will be a company meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, earlier, the head coach of the Russian football club, Leonid Sluckey, took part in a training course in the CSCA club.
He expressed his concern at the post after the failure of the Russian National Command in Euro-2016 in France.
However, he took responsibility for the bad results of the collection.
In the struggle between Angola and the U.S., Namibia suffered a great deal during the long fight against apartheid.
Nevertheless, after the fall of independence from South Africa in 1990, that country has achieved enormous success in the last few years with the population of 2.4 million people.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government focuses on education.
While people in developed countries recognize themselves as an understanding of free primary and secondary education, many poor countries in the middle and even primary schools require payment for education.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to pay for the cost of training.
In Namibia, however, primary schools are free of charge.
Moreover, there has been free and secondary education since 2015.
The authorities also work actively in other important areas.
Malaria destruction efforts have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the last ten years.
Despite the international trend of inequality, it is shrinking in Namibia.
As compared with the 1993 indicator, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell to 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased from nearly 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest level of freedom of expression in Africa, according to the reporters without borders.
The United States and other rich States have been significantly affected by the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Transparency International ' s Indices of Corruption, which is a human rights defender.
Even now when prices fall, Namibia is able to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt ratio for GDP is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least by traditional methods of assessment, remains high - almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is almost 17 per cent infected.
According to the World Bank estimates, Namibia is a number of middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is, in fact, a developing country.
Namibia, of course, is facing some of the challenges that confront the weak developed economies.
The State has to develop a very large and impressive country with a small population.
In the territory of the country in the desert, isolated cascades of hunters live, which must be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
The integration of people who have been in the world economy for the past four centuries is not an easy task for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it is faced with the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to give up its arms, but the country was facing the problem.
Almost immediately after the fall of independence, the authorities were involved in the establishment of a diverse economy and a broken society.
It is noteworthy that the competing political factions were gathered together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides medical care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbors.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health institutions in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians understood that the neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with the inadequate water resources, participate in regional health projects, encourage investment and exchanges of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia rightly concluded that the rich natural resources could easily become a curse by helping to discourage many.
The authorities understand that natural resources in Namibia need to contribute to infrastructure and productive capacities.
They also realize that it would be inappropriate not to seek the maximum income from the country ' s sale of resources and to review investment laws and income contracts in order to ensure that they are.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong support for the Government of Freedom of Speech is so important.
As the Head of State of Hage Haege Haeongbo noted, the media often say that he does not like it.
However, after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has gained, said the President.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are related to renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country each year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that have started with serious deficiencies - racism, colonialism, inequality and low development - can rise to general enlightenment.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and admiration.
Many have heard of the Golden Verna, the ancient gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
Please, this was the largest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the time of the eruption of Varne necropole, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts was found — more than three thousand total weights of 6 kilograms.
Only one storage known as "Mogil No. 43" was taken out of 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the former gold of the world could soon go to an invisible type of bus found by archaeologists in July this year.
We're back in Bulgaria, in a dormitory village known as Tell Yuncit.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Unazite is located at sea, along the village of the Union of the Pazardian region.
The bus is a gold pole, turned into a ball.
Yavor Beggijev, director of the Tell-Unacitia detachment, dated 4600 B.C.E. to our summer and claimed that it was the oldest of Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
Varna's sacraments are, for example, due to the same period, 4600 to 4200 g before our summer.
There are no technologies currently available to ensure that the metal can be detached.
Where, then, is the certainty of what gold is?
Apparently, Professor Bigjiev knows more than Reuters reported: "I'm absolutely sure that the United Nations gold is older than the Varna gold."
This is an extremely important finding: this is a short object, but it is large enough to take a suitable place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Biggijev, scientists were soon analyzing the composition of the metal, as well as re-examined and more closely the archaeological site where gold artifacts were found.
This will help fix the bus with the maximum possible accuracy.
The location of the find also makes a lot of sense.
Tell the United Nations is a significant village, even if you never heard of it.
At present, Tel Yunity is considered the former "city" of Europe.
The Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in seven thousand years before our era.
During the next centuries, the region had developed metal processing from the acquisition of first metallurgy skills to the creation of a fully valued industry.
There is a special name in the native history of this archeological community: the Balkan-Carpatian metallurgic province.
In the 5th century before our era, the metal processing centers began to grow in urban areas.
They are now called the ancient cities of Europe.
One of them, Tell the United Nations, probably the oldest one, was found here in 4400 B.C.E.
I would call the Tel unacitate a prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient village, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is the oldest place of Shumer for a thousand years," says Beigeev, having in general the idea that the city culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
There the first city came to understand this word.
The Tel Aviv will be released in 1976.
The archaeologists then dug about 12 acres [12 ha], about a third of the estimated total area of the population.
The remains of the wall were found, which once reached three meters high.
From home and master little has been preserved, however, archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, the urban area, the "work centre" and the residential areas.
The U.S. T. is often referred to as the Bird City: dozens of bird pictures have been found here.
All birds are represented in room condition, from here it was assumed that they were not decorative objects but the object of the local culture.
The bird town was destroyed about 4400 B.C.E. by Indian tribes coming from the north-east.
The hunters had no cities, so there were bad weapons and weapons.
The three-metre stairwell walls did not stop them.
The archaeologists have discovered clear signs of a violent war: the remains of the elderly, women and children, followed by the wounds of the fighting towers were found inside.
New findings and new facts appear every year, and I am familiar with the ancient history of humanity.
Bulgarian archaeologists are often not talking about certain cultures, but about the "potent" first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive to seek this civilization was the "gold Varna" found recently in 1972.
It's logical that Varna's greenest gold had to have something to do with something - something like the crochet gold bus created in the United Nations Tel.
In Porsche you have seen model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out by the team specialists working with serial machines.
Retro-Luk, for example, is a special color of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model – even a logo of the model.
In addition, Turga received a company white chart along the boats and special 20-inch RS Spyder bicycle discs, as well as some details of the design of the cubes called "white-gold metallic".
The retro-cracker is less than noticeable: it is distinguished, in large account, by the sero-synomas, by new grids with expanded electro-regulatory ranges and separate black anodized table with the unit's logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each purchaser will receive a glass for the car and a large-scale album with photographs of the production process.
The strong installation of the Porsche Exclusive specialist did not become: the retro-targ of characteristics is completely compatible with the series.
It consists of a six-cylinder engine of 3,0 l of turbonad, which develops 420 B.C. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can be speeded up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with a limited fee, but no value of each individual player is reported.
Facebook and bloggers have launched an arms race.
Recently, the introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the cover of advertising on websites, has led to decision makers to block the advertising in response.
AdBlock Plus issued an "optimulation" but Facebook plans to do it soon.
So AdBlock Plus announced his new technology, which, most recently, remains effective.
The representatives of the sect noted that, in an attempt to deceive the new technology of the “unblocked” advertising, AdBlock Plus’s decision, along with commercial ads, also blocks many regular posts from friends or sites.
On Facebook they regretted AdBlock Plus's policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source of the TechCrunch, a code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be ready for the next few hours.
Thus, the cuts and blockades have developed their kind of “arming race”, trying to play with each other, while the injured party has become users who have missed interesting records from friends or who have seen a promotion where they have not been accustomed to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the blockade of advertising have recently raised heated disputes.
In Murmansk, a force officer will appear before the court · Night Murmansk.
His case had already been investigated by the Russian Federation for the Murman Area Follow-up Committee.
The alleged charges against 54-year-old men were very serious, and they were violent sexual acts.
It was concluded that, at the end of November 2015, Paulova was charged in the streets of Murmansk with sexual violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sentence of the article provides for the maximum penalty for deprivation of liberty for a period of up to six years.
Dongfeng brings to Russia a cross-section of Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - website About the scroll www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 - representative of the gathering population in China of cars that include the dignity of the mine and cross-country.
Another Russian Prime Minister is the Pickup Rich New.
Many western companies of the Moscow International Autosolans have decided to ignore this year, so the empty Cross Expo exhibition halls will be filled with Chinese companies.
In particular, the powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor company, which has a large range of Russian markets and is intended to offer to our car lovers a number of interesting news.
One of them will be Crossven Dongfeng Fengguang 370, who was sold in China at the price of 55,900 June (about 550,000 rubs at the current rate).
To the Russians, it is almost too light, even to the question of supplies in our country as long as they are in the course of the discussion.
In China, however, Fengguang 370, as a result of the June sales, was expected to arrive at 11 places on the list of the most sold mines, although due to the higher road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic load on the lower corner of the cube, it can be counted as a crossover.
Crossvan is built on the front platform of the Youth Model Fengguang 360, 370 with the same base of 2725 mm, but the cubes are much longer (4565 mm v. 4510 mm), the design of the gold, and the furnishing of the treasure.
Salon was decorated with wooden plans, but a large vertical sensor screen, "like Tesla" on the central console, was only on the early exhibition exhibitions of Crossvana, and the machine with "music" was sold more easily.
Five of the seven ground floorings are easily constructed, forming a 1650 mm-long load area, with a maximum storage capacity of 1500 C.E.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is designed to be one - 1.5 litres of gas "atmospheric" in 115 C.E., accompanied by a 5-point mechanical transfer.
With regard to the dynamic characteristics of the machine, the manufacturer is humbly reducing, as he promises an attractive budget of the owner at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the last generation, but with a somewhat enchanted Chinese stylers designed.
Despite the moral ageing structure, this model has so far been used as a stable demand for a Chinese consumer as a reliable and unsatisfying "workaholic".
At the same price, Rich New is also interested in Russians, since modern Japanese picnics have become extremely expensive.
Rich New is divided into two engines: gas 2.4 l (137 c) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 c).
The transfer box is only a mechanical one, leading to the back wheel, but there are modifications and with a strictly integrated front.
There will be a stand by Dongfeng and a new A9 flagship, his Russian Prime Minister, his Chinese company, was still anonymised in June.
The current crossovers on the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest newspapers - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian line Dongfeng consists of two models: S30 seat and H30 Cross.
In seven months of this year, 696 Chinese companies were operating in our country.
Transport charges will cease to be sent by email at www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the delivery of property tax notifications.
All Russian carriers have been accustomed to a change of schedule for the past year: they receive an invitation to pay transportation tax in the summer and summer.
However, many will not be hungry this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection, without a single noise, has changed the notice order of citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Communicator's Office" on the official website of the nalog.ru department, reports will be received in electronic form.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically conceived by online users and deleted from the standard "bumbling" transmission.
The novelty covers all owners of vehicles and mobility.
All the rest will continue to receive normal letters.
In addition, the possibility of returning to the old scheme is also available to the owner of an account on the website.
In August, they were required to visit the tax office and write a statement.
On the one hand, a new order is more timely and easier.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the appointment, when the letter is going to be a few days and can be completely lost.
In addition, the number of Internet users of the tax inspection exceeded 18 million, which would allow the public to have a serious financial impact on the postal transmission.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have been registered in the " Personal Office" to receive a unified service and have long forgotten it.
These people will not receive reports by mail and, without knowledge, fall into the category of non-payments with all consequences.
Access to the Payroll Office is provided in three ways: through an account of the port of gosuslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally in any tax inspection department (in spite of the place of decision).
We recall that the transport tax has to be paid by 1 December in the current year.
The release of the notice began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G class, in which the work is directed towards a very high achievement, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not upset G-Power's masters, who were involved in the modification of the Mercedes-AMG G 63 sport.
G-Power is known for its access to BMW cars, but none of its human masters are strange.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-powered airship with aerodynamic tank and aperture up to 5,4 c?
The "moscules" of the complex "helic" were used by the master for the advantages of opening a 5.5-litre of a double-six.
And the dynamics of the hundreds have improved by 0.1 s, and now the flying "circuit" is capable of fishing for 5.3 s.
On the other hand, speeds with average speeds give him a better chance.
The speed rate increases: if standard G 63 does not travel more than 210 km/h, the tunnel is capable of surviving 250 km/h.
Make the car practically unique from its professional driver, with the exception of other driving discs - 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Lucedes-Maybach Lukash unit announced an excellent six-metre conceptual purchase, which will be presented in the context of the Pebble-Bich elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz will compete with BMW i and will develop its electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, at least four environmental news is expected.
