Rehabilitation strategy of the Republican parties
Republikaz leaders have given rise to their policy of fighting the need for voluntary guides.
However, Brennan's average rate of death is less than half the number of people who die of white fever in the United States.
The Republican lawyers have recently recorded only 300 cases of voluntary fraud in the United States.
One is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voluntary participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly underpinned by the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, they are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in this spirit most of the American governments have issued new laws that challenge the process of election or registration into the electoral list since 2009.
This juv recorded the exchanges after the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 states.
As a result, 180 proposals were submitted for the law restricting voluntary law in 41 countries only in 2011.
New voluntary laws require voters to provide evidence of authenticity with the photograph and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the time for elections in advance, undermine the right to be registered on the list of voters on the day of the election, and withdraw voluntary rights to citizens recorded in the criminal register.
Prior to the 2006 elections, he did not require any American state to submit a statement of authenticity with the photograph.
The first state to make this claim was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law was confirmed in 2008 by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Republican authorities have speeded up this process in other countries as well.
In the last two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 countries with a view to introducing voters to present evidence of authenticity with the photograph.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, they do not have an American public university certificate of authenticity, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age allowed to vote, do not have any evidence of validity with the photograph issued by the government authorities of their state.
There is no further evidence of the identity of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the required evidence of authenticity is often more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions are not specifically addressed to young people, minors and low-income persons.
25% of Africans, 15% of people under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age therefore do not have the required description of the photograph.
And that's not all.
Students who are as volunteers in their capacity for democratic candidates are not allowed in a number of countries to use their certificate of identity with their school photo.
On the other hand, the Member States shall allow members of the fishing or fishing clubs who prefer more Republican candidates to use the cards set up by that club in the elections.
By 2004, there was no request for a citizenship permit.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have adopted laws, which establish the obligation of voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly lead to a reduction in the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is also important to note that two of the three Spanishs are taking the lead in the democratic side.
The Republican legislators in 2011 supported eight laws that violated the vote on the day of the vote.
They also restricted the rights of persons and groups to provide assistance to volunteers who want to write.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, the polling campaign helped to record about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted after 2009, however, resulted in a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% in 2006.
The Republican legislators in the other five States have then adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the general elections in 2008 in Florida, 33% of African voters who had previously voted in favour, although African voters in that country were only 13%.
It was the same in Spain.
They created only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voted in favour.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all volleyballs, formed only 46% of the volleyball players.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters were very careful against the approval of laws restricting the registration of voters.
The democratic governments have blocked some of the legislative proposals.
In order to stop the payment of the most controversial laws, the Attorney-General of the United States even filed a complaint.
In the beginning, they were able to limit their damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States were adopted by the law requiring submission of evidence of authenticity with the photograph.
The new rules, however, are totally unsustainable in the exercise of voting rights in 2012.
In particular, the democratic criticism speaks of the premise of approved laws and considers it to be a manifest effort to influence the results of elections in key states in 2012.
The 2011 Brennan report shows that the States where these laws were approved represent 171 out of 270 votes in the group of voters required for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too early to announce that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voluntary participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly underpinned by the American democratic system.
Explosion of the cancer of the prostate: complete the examination or not?
The PSA test has led to slightly missing results that were not properly negative or even wrong positive, leading to the rest of the medical steps.
It's still increasing the attractiveness of men who've already been so excited about the investigation to go.
Let's go check on it or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, high levels of contamination among individual tested groups were therefore difficult to interpret these results and to make a valuable recommendation.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different mortality between patients who were under investigation and those who did not.
The study also showed after 12 years of absence that those who are not in the study have 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis exposure.
I therefore recommend a 50-year-old or 40-year-old examination if your immediate visitor had cancer.
The most threatened group is also the men of African American origin.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is removed.
There are aggressive types of cancers and species that are ineffective.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to patients the safety of its type of cancer, to offer it possible alternatives, not to treat cancers that have no long-term impact on life, and to focus more on active control over disability in these cases.
Today, a number of men with cancer diagnosed are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their life.
We will propose more active control and, if there is no progress, we will offer them treatment.
We continue to establish more and more clearly the criteria that help to decide which kind of treatment and which is not.
Still, I recommend that the investigation be completed.
It is important, however, to complete the contact with your doctor and decide whether or not it is appropriate to submit an examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember node created a tool that allows to evaluate for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, it seems to be the best means to limit the risk of disease to adopt the principle of healthy lifestyles.
It is estimated that if all healthy people ate and drank enough, up to 30% of cancer cases would occur.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this data would be at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, a Canadian cancer research company.
On the contrary, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by pregnancy.
Some percentages also remain completely unclear.
The Canadian cancer research company remains the priority of the fight against smoking, even though the number of cancers is increasing.
Cigarettes represent 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for a few others.
It's an uncomplicated damage to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million dogs in Quebec today," says speech spokesman André Beaulieu.
Exciting data: 10 years after the chicken stops burning, the risk of death on half-life cancer is low.
Weight
Sustainability and obesity are another risk factor for the spread of disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat tissue and endocrine, liver, kidneys, and parts.
"The research reveals that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer," the report adds.
Exceeding
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Even too high consumption may lead to increased risk of exposure to colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to take care of yourself and the recognition for which he also pays.
Conservation of the mass by injection, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's brain and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the studies have not yet brought a significant conclusion.
Studies aimed at vitamin E are disaggregated according to SCC.
Although one of them says it's a risk reduction of prostate cancer, other studies speak more about its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been demonstrated in any case.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to focus on how important it is to talk about his concerns and the past of his family with his doctor.
"Research doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs' boson examined
The notification of the likely occurrence of Higgs boson called for an outbreak in summer.
There is a view that this boson is divided into a mechanism that is responsible for all mass in the universe.
And it's also about the last part, whose existence presupposes a standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of attitudes and behavior - which has not been observed empirically.
However, among physics, it's not about the hundreds of percent sure it's about the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a whole new piece that is very similar to Higgs' boss, as predicted by the standard model.
The new date published this week at a major physical convention in Kuwait is more confirmed, but they still lack all the information so that we can have absolute security.
However, let's assume that it's about Higgs' boson, because the risk of making mistakes seems small, and let's look at what's really going on.
In this world, he pays for a completely undisputed law that makes it impossible for two things to be released at the same time at the same time.
This rule can't cover - and don't try too hard, otherwise you'll hurt yourself.
Even though partial physics is very strange in the world, it is shown that it also pays for a similar law: Paul’s exclamation principle, which states that two parts cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quant state" - this "stand" of the group is said to create some of their properties.
Next he divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find organized citizens, or farmers who obediently adhere to Paul’s principle.
And on the other hand, the bosons, under the anarchists who don't care about anything, are definitely not that principle, which means they can be at the same place at the same time.
These bosones continue to be divided into two groups according to the device (by means of a simple miracle), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of Berkeley: the masses that we leave here without notice, and the "force particles", where they spread great natural forces and with which Higgs' boson is most likely to be affected in some way.
It is necessary to say, however, that these bosones are not as exotic as they might be imagined.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with unusual banality: a photo, or a "part of the light", which is a "nosit" electromagnetic force.
When that part of the electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "screams" this electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a surface attached to the fish.
From this "rejection" comes electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultrafilament, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photo - and then one of the bosses, "power carriers".
More stable fields
It's also with the Higgs Boson, just by the difference that "sharp" needs another field, the Higgs field to reveal this boson.
This Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it needs to achieve very high energy values, just like in the frozen cold of a fish, which will start only a very large balloon.
For this reason, it is necessary to use as much as a particle accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hydrogen accelerator with an insulating connector is a core of 27 km! - so that such energy can be generated.
Analogue with the electromagnetic field is again used to explain the relationship between Higgs and weight.
With the electromagnetic field, they do not react either to all parts or to all materials.
Some, for example magnets, do it, but others don't -- the piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to the refrigerator itself.
And he also pays that the Higgs field does not respond to all the parts: those who do so have a certain amount, while the others (such as the photo, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks what are all these researchs bringing him?
In the field of science, it is about verifying the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physics to describe any discrepancies between observation and PM forecasts.
Not a few physics has gone too far in order to find them, because the same difference could open the space "new physics" and cancel some tables in the model.
It needs to be found that the model has a long range of shortcomings, does not give any explanation of gravity (oh!) or dark weights that create approximately 80% of the relative weight (see oh!).
However, the CERN device has not yet been released.
Odezvy
The challenges of these research in your daily life can only be very difficult, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be nothing.
Look: At the very beginning of the 60s, there were no lasers in Bell's labs or a dream of the revolution that their work has already been doing.
They predicted scientific use, but nothing else.
The physics Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was found in 1960, and who created the first steel laser paper (previous paper was pulsed) in 1962, I have already said it - the laser was initially considered to be such a "play in the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, the use may also come out of all the tools that cover research.
For example, tonight Willard Boyle created a small light bulb in 1969 during his work designed for optical purposes.
This photographer, even though Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as "ko" of all digital photographers in the world and brought him Nobel's prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that the activities around LHC need to change our lives, but it means that a person doesn't really know...
Palatine care - The best way to get out of life... ← Le Devre
By means of his Commission on Immediate Deaths, Quebec has recently addressed the complex issues relating to the end of life.
The debate should continue slowly and at the same time adopts a legislative proposal.
There is still much work to be done in this basic area.
The magazine Le Devor tried to look at this question more carefully.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregia.
She's got a double-year discount.
"They've given me five years of life and it's already seven," says without emotion on their bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he came last day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The poor man did his job: an unsatisfied weakness prevents him from spending himself on the toilet or just eating on his own.
He looks at the cool breakfast and agrees that we can help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop him, brings him medications, offers a bath.
She's taking to normal death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of this trap, which humiliates me," he says.
A few hours later, he found his doctor's team on his drug problem.
"For the rest of your life, a man learns that the boy's strength is in the wind," reports Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's device.
Returning to the child phase is an unacceptable defeat for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of a man," he says, "that the return will be accepted, says psychologist.
According to the opinion of a number of people who are staying in palliative care, the basic moments are played in the very core of such a return.
Patients who come home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care are suffering from all cancers.
Their forecasts are at least three months of life.
At this stage, doctors and sisters who care about them do not give them the so-called "medicine" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst concern is to die "in a deep knowledge."
But my illness allowed me to reveal to my children.
"I have many children," he adds.
"I have no wish in my life," she says, and then she lets us put her breathing device.
Still he is still happy in the following days for the last visit of his son from Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, care for the body with the help of survival.
It looks like a palliative care that goes on if she can't do anything else anymore.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there's one bed of palliative care for 11,700 citizens.
It's very small if we realize we're all going to die once.
This is where life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he may be given a brandy or a pepsi shower, according to the taste.
Diabetes don't have to watch the cold sugar anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night, they didn't send a beer to Mr. X. who died later that night.
He's drinking his son's beer this morning at the honor of his father-in-law.
"We help patients as close as they are," reports Natalie Savard, director of pacific services.
In Victor-Gadbois's house, one day they're going after another, but they don't look like each other.
According to a three-year-old man who is happy with his family’s final meeting with the police, while attending his post, a tragically six-year-old man surrounded by his parents, his wife, and two small children will die after he has tried every opportunity to survive.
"There are always three to five beds here for people with cancer for up to 45 years," reports Dr. Christiane Martel's report.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois's home come here from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to reduce the suffering, as long as the patient reaches the final phase of his life, whether it is home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And a number of organisations, such as Victor-Gadbois's home and the Grand Montréal palliative Society, are more specialized in the care provided by oncological patients.
And just this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to the fear that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are afraid of adopting the laws on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, there has been a manifesto signed in the field of palliative therapy, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, where they demonstrate their disagreement with such initiatives.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec medical system is not sufficiently effective to ensure access for all persons to quality palliative care until it is possible to agree with the execution of euthanasia.
As she says, she recently lived with a patient who spent 14 days in emergency care without anyone taking the necessary steps to get rid of her.
It is feared that patients will not ask for death because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, he pays that a number of oncologists are paying attention to his patients up to the last minute, regardless of the unreceptive prognosis.
Hope for Hélène Richard's survival was already minimal when she gave up on breast cancer.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to end my treatment, she said she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she'd tell us.
And then she told me it was over!
No strong care
Dr. Martel suggests that 90% of the patients who survive to die are grateful to their healing doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative bird died.
But it is necessary to say that palliative care is definitely not effective in the treatment of disease.
According to Elsie Monereau, management of palliative care in the Community for domestic palliative care in the Grand Montréal area, patients are treating diseases in 8% of cases.
At the same end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that the patient has to endure until the end of the day, whether it has been given or has been given sedatives.
We can't pretend we don't have this part of suffering.
The patient we don't cure will have an even greater chance of accessing paliative sedatives.
Patients who are not provided with sedatives always say, "I want to die."
But this doesn't always necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to save me from pain."
The implementation of this report has enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Health Research Institute.
Miscellaneous real scandals in Quebec
Road management officials, construction and public works business, lobbying political parties and experts on Italian Mafia continue to report what they know about a wonderful "system", where buildings, state officials, politicians, councils and mafia are carried out.
This "obor" came from Quebec's taxpayers very dear, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has split since the time we took the basic measures," said ironic Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebecan ambassador and former police chief in Montreal.
Thanks to him, in 2011, he was scheduled on the basis of a follow-up survey aimed at providing funds in relation to the construction of a railway in Quebec, which the more liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charrest approved for long-term expenditures.
The Duchesneauv report confirmed the direct link between the industry, the invisible financing of the party and the corruption of state officials.
"Since the start of the survey in 2010,," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport has been able to secure a billion-dollar contract," when some people have held back their instincts to get part of them!
Charbonneau's commission "who led to the demos of the two-year-olds," adds hope that she will be able to "discover some people's passions".
Standing unit for combating corruption established in 2011
A permanent unit for the fight against corruption established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition to this, the Marteaus police, who have been ensuring that the exhibition's " moneycard" will significantly reduce the fuse of the ban...
In the past few weeks, they have carried out a series of visits and have regretted the hypocrisy and corruption of a number of present representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, an elderly town in the province.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just left his old town of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that he was reimbursing charges for public procurement.
The formal charges have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and operators of the Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called for a consensus when he explained to the Commission the mechanism for obtaining public orders.
He himself committed 3% of the value of the order he received in Montreal, to the media connected with the Mafia, which then transferred the Union Montréal page to the candidate Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was a witness to all sides after 2000 and owed over $88,000 of Canadian dollars (about EUR 68 000) to provincial parties, especially to liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he organized an illegal financial collection for former liberal vice-president Nathali Normandeau.
Contracts with cashiers whose prices were exceeded
In Montreal, he was working a "system" of corruption very hard.
Gilles Surprenant, former transport engineer, described it in a very detail before the Commission: for ten years he had received from the construction companies a call for flights, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey sports and cashiers in total of $736 000 exchanges for orders with money.
Other public operators from the transport sector admitted that they were allowed to pay compensation for over 30% to 40% overestimating invoices through unfair multi-actions.
The organizer of Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of putting his eyes on the common budget, which he brought into his possession with the spy money.
On the basis of these findings, Tremblay left early in November, which Montréal threw into the vast crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first visual envoys who issued a warning signal.
Since 2010, Rivière-des-Prairies has grown up against the sale of the common land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million propellers directly in the midst of the rising trade with property.
70% Spanish money in volunteer campaigns
The study, which will finally be started, says that "he is trying to understand the functioning of a system of inspired silence to stop the gangrene and beat the guilty."
The process is, according to it, "bad, but cool."
We are in the cleaning phase of the wound, but it is necessary to set up a self-examination unit in Montreal and ensure that these wrong practices cannot be returned.
It's like he's involved.
Right.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have cut down hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially afraid of the role of "the messengers who have been informed about this letter" if they have not contributed to these jokes!
It is estimated that 70% of the funding of volunteer campaigns in Quebec comes from Spanish money, and with irony, it adds: "I have heard that it is only a bad thing to do."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the pay to $100, but it does not agree with the situation: "Until the electoral expenditure is strictly limited, the money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a complex control of the system of awarding public contracts and funding of the party: "We can't stop anymore; if we focus carefully on the basis of things, we can re-establish stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance with laws."
If this story turns out the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who laughs at him to look at his own court...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season you and PSG have set up a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
You can explain to her that all individuals have gone to themselves, or simply a new PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day I get along with them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier when you're on the tapes.
It's all going very fast in the fotoball.
But I don't lose my head.
From the beginning of my preparation at INF Clairfontaine until after I moved to Saint-Etienne, I always talked about a single step.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti set up...
Powers from this year are used to playing games at very high levels.
He also knows that every trainer is fundamental.
And it turns out that a player like me has a greater taste for running and wants to give the maximum performance.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has a lot to do with my position.
He's got assistants in his hand, like Claude Makelele, who played at the same station as me.
What about Ancelotti's a good word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the techniques.
Today, there is no equal in law 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has extensive experience and has received a lot of titles with the spy teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's playing another title in Paris.
In January, I concluded a comfortable conversation with him.
I had a lot of injuries behind me.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
At the 1st floor, Lyon picked us up our head position.
But we're still in custody.
One of our main objectives is the League of Masters: it was very easy to get into the eight-finals.
What's your club doing with this competition?
We're trying to go as far as possible.
It can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a hard fight for the quality of the European team.
First, we want to win our qualifying team in front of Port so we can play in the eighth-final house.
Can PSG be in the short-term horizon of a large European club?
I've got to figure out what it's like to...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and write into history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial page, the PSG has the means to implement this objective.
And would it be a great failure to win in the 1st century as in the late summer season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to win a league title.
We've missed enough in the Lonesia season.
We were cursed in May because we had to win.
We had a good season.
We've collected 79 points.
He usually pays that you're a clear master from 79 points...
Only another club, Montpellier, had the season even more wonderful.
I think it's gonna happen this year.
Even though they're trying to get a big team like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we've got a weapon available to defeat them.
You think the PSG media are expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect us much in view of what invested here and what players we have.
We just take it.
It's the fact that if we break up at home with Troyes 4:0 and there's still something we're reading in the news, it's not quite pleasant.
The man asks what people can want more than you.
Of course it won't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up an iron style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Lise of Masters, we learned that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which has not passed into the second season, and has also invested a lot!
In view of the invested sums, it would be reasonable to expect you to have another 15 points of interest!
That's where you attack the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille Clubs, which did not happen too much in the late summer season, joined the new PSG in another phase.
It shows how wonderful the 1st line is.
I hope we'll be able to laugh in the spring and say that despite all the difficulties, we have been able to win.
It seems like the PSG is all about Zlatana Ibrahimvice.
It's good to say there's "dependency on the Golden."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and that he gives a lot of heads.
That's why he came here and showed that he's a star number one.
Wherever he went, he proved he's a big player, a world star.
We respect people and players in our team.
And he respects the people around him.
What he got is really extraordinary.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the world's best dancers, also makes it possible for others to grow along with him.
How did you survive the Euro 2012 with the French representative?
It's like a breakdown.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, I couldn't play the way I imagined.
But I survived, and I got out of it stronger.
Today, I can play good games in the representative.
And that's what I've been hoping for from my way to the representative.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our appearance exemplary.
How do you look at the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the national team?
He's talking about the results.
We're in a good position to qualify for MS.
The coach will choose exactly, he is close to the players and will be able to compete for victory.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I don't want to compare it.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the deadline (1:1) from October 16th in Spain with a solemn agreement?
This game has given us a sense of self-consciousness.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't have such a fun for my career.

As these technologies are more often true, there is a clear political perspective: the conviction that the existing financial system based on banking monopolies leads to the financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose discoverant is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudotom), represents both virtual money (relative to dollar, euro...), such a secure translation protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers connected to the network.
About a thousand websites already take bitcoins as gifts or as payment means.
The bitcoin course was first reached at a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it ended at $2, today it is moving to a limit of about ten dollars (see courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared with the world’s exchange of real money or financial products, that is not surprising.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on the virtual funds that came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "competitive dollar and euro" and "the period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin from other types of virtual money lies in that it is as "credit" used for the process in video games that a person gets to play or can buy (and easily and change again).
The social network Facebook also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority shall control and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all depositaries of ordinary accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers are all online.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose another address for each payment that ensures anonymity.
The Information Society related to this transaction is electronically signed by the encryption system with a double key.
The network can thus verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is still possible to ensure that the modified bitcoins exist in a public book of ordinary accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to record this new transaction in this book.
It shall be used to resolve the mathematical task of assigned computers whose solver, as a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
It is about the file resolution phase, i.e. the conversion of the size file to a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will "take" this new transaction and add the number to it, and then they're going to "sharp".
The purpose is to find a number that provides a specific print (only zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other waves are easily controlled by its control.
The transaction will then appear unharmably linked to the network of all other transactions; any adjustment would have been made to change the print.
If the user would like to pay twice the same money very quickly for himself (up to ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be released because each of them has different prints.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this compensation is divided into two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by 21 million, however, it can be done up to to the stomillion, so the margin space is here...
The burden of the task also increases with increasing level of calculation.
The network's already running its entrances and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have been detected by the banned Bitcoins.
"The used debt is not a separate protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a company for real money payments that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of borrowing cash due to this anonymous service.
But this problem is also a matter of urgency.
Prominent players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this attitude.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, are accepted.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Constitution recently analyzed the book of ordinary accounts in Israel and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins do not run.
In November, "Obrov's snows" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars was exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who lives to transform bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of pedagogical books on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent credit card (with real money) or wireless payment mobile, but it uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are easier to obtain.
The wearer also corrects his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be installed in traders where new terminals or software are not needed.
It's enough to convey the address that can be "photographed and identified" by Pierre Noizat, who confirms that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general move towards the deterioration of hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin passes, it's still a moment ahead, but the year 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also expects the assessment of the various risks considered today to be increased if such money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French authorities left their territory of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobie).
NATO and US units should follow up at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of their territory and to choose their own future and not all of us.
The greatest prize has been endured by people on Afghanistan's foreign side, which we have persecuted since we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have come with 88 killed soldiers, all of them being hurt and hated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leading representatives who fled to Pakistan, but often it is about refugees who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been added to them by Jewish, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajikistan.
Now they use tolerance and the help of local opponents, but if the western forces are taken away, their support will fail.
The departure of the French units from the base of the Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains of the mandlons, thanks to the French loans, went on together.
Cars and tanked vehicles arrived in Kabul without an attack on the air transport of helicopters.
Since the end of 2014 the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed significantly from their unstoppable process in 1994 to 1996.
The cable was once empty, and the country was in the blood and fire due to wars between the various armed groups.
Their taking over control over the country was then considered for their type of release, return to safety.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these foreigners, which the entire organization of Al-Ká'ida has managed, but their situation has not improved in our time.
In some cases, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a position.
The main fighters from the war against Soviet units returned to power in 2001.
They became leaders, strengthened the national territories that sold as buildings for Iranian and Pakistani refugees, and used large American bans for subcontractors.
They were disappointed; most of them were not even at war.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people complain about a government that won't make any trouble.
A number of young people want to leave like those who have been able to use American security: capital union is important.
Young people are already engaged in war and associated ideology.
During the exile in Iran or Pakistan, the modern world was known and its benefits were dependent on it.
About 65% of the population is younger than 25 years of age; there are currently 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, five of whom live in total population.
In cities, the public schools are full, girls and boys are going there.
This young people will need to be given work, and they will no longer want to return to the misery of the past or to the corruption of some representatives.
All, including armed opposition, enjoy mobile phones; televisions and Turkish series that show the modern world follow everywhere.
The army is already there.
Will the offices that will be placed in her head be considered legitimate?
Some leaders fight against the Soviet army already renew provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a hot country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy certain measures of decentralization in the form of Western states, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so it had begun to undermine the position of the prime minister that had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzáí does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of elections scheduled for the autumn of 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since 50 years ago.
No industry has been able to restore, no refurbishment is working, no basic system is correct.
Everything is brought up; nothing is done, but fruit and vegetables.
The Presidency has a private initiative.
The three decades of war destroyed in the country would require government control of infrastructure.
It was reported that Afghanistan had vast wealth.
And that only made sense that the Western States were here just to strengthen her.
No energy for the processing of iron or steel at the site and no means for transporting raw materials across the mountains, but no burden of growth cannot be borne.
The Chinese have almost left the border on Mes Aynak and have left the international archeological teams (with the World Bank's support) to explore a vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most prominent employee in the entire province.
One day it will also need to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, to which a large part of imports and exports depend.
The departure of the French war units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement proposes the continuation of the usual types of aid: girls and boys lycea, French colleges at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative to "get a heart and soul" has been working on a difficult task to coordinate aid and military activities, and then the Ministry of Defence (Cicic) has been providing the service of the Ministry of Defence (Cicic), which was abolished in 2012, but has achieved through the countless French non-governmental organization of a series of successes in the area of common interest and steps for the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which involved the number of local workers, helped to ease the excitement: cooking, cooking, drinking water, heating, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the working area.
What do we remember about two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very convenient in these areas, which are often at sea heights above 2,000 m.
The majority received 10 written applications for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the rise of the leading foreign groups, they must, in their words, reach an impartial civil assistance in their benefits, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursey left for another party of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the declaration of the Constitution, which temporarily confers unlimited power on it, it decided to play a vow.
In the middle, he announced without prejudice to the opinion of all others that the Constitutional Assembly would soon accept a final vote.
A few weeks ago, the head of the state made this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been repeatedly supplemented, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal agreements.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the spread of the country.
In view of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic delirie", he continues to "reject his word" and "declare the right".
However, his supporters ensure that it is about the means, as quickly as possible, to cope with the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be concluded in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time, which will give the Brethren a derogation from the purpose of the text to the Egyptians to explain the article under Article.
For the President, it is also about how to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rejects protests.
As confirmed in the discussion for the American Week of Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
In particular, because this rapidly organised vote puts Egypt's people before the end of the day: "Obey my text, or I leave unlimited powers", which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new Constitution.
And in this particular atmosphere, 85 Members of the aforementioned constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists agreed on the text yesterday.
Most liberals failed when voting.
In mid-November, shortly before the declaration of the Constitution was published, the doors were closed, saying they had no opportunity to change their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society, or members of religious minorities have seen their progress.
In order to achieve settlement capacity, 11 persons from the reward line were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It is not surprising then that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to argue that one of the few disputes turned around that day... hours for prayer when some members of the committee thought that the hours in the sitting room were not properly set.
The text on which the vote was voted yesterday evening is drawn up in 234 articles.
Subject to general attention, Article 2 is finally in line with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the rules of the courts are the main source of law".
The Salafistic parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped that it would replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would make it possible to apply more closely.
For Islam, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Creatives" are intended by liberals who see only a linguistic problem.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They shall, in particular, refer to Article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar the advisory role, in particular on matters relating to the control of the legal framework with the right to privacy.
According to the expert on Egypt, Sophie Pommier's experience is disturbing because "people called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
They can look at the beginning of the theocracy."
The concerns of liberals are even more confusing than the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the present one.
"There has been no specific religious consequence in the past.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a State of the Framework.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not wealthy, but university workers, a number of them have studied in French schools," the peace of mind of Alexis Blueet, who prepares for the constitutional transition to Egypt.
It agrees, however, that "there may be disputes regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used therein belong to the religious dictionary.
This is particularly the reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal knowledge, p.r.].
And in the future, a question can be raised about the extent to which civil courts are competent so that they can express themselves about it."
Yesterday, the text approved is highly criticised, in addition to religious sites, for the sake of the extended powers that the President of the Republic does.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that they have been severely restricted to the former regime.
Another quiet place: the power of a trusted army.
In accordance with the consent of the representatives of the army, there will be no audit of the budget for defence to be carried out by Parliament, but the National Defence Council.
Then there will be no ban on the administration of civilians in military courts, as required by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
This association shall speak in relation to the text which it intends to oppose freedom, of its own shortcomings.
The honest deed of redness is maintained and the strike is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for printing.
In addition, no article leaves a protected woman, heba Morayaf of the Human Rights Watch organization.
According to it, the only fine shall be the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous sentence.
While the President of Egypt had to appear on television last night, the events are scheduled today afternoon.
The Heads of State will then manifest themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, the sacred places, the world’s poppy and the sea are waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The land of promise is linked to the size of Bible truth, modern comfort, and the inability of nature.

But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near Knesset (Parliament).

Each of them offers pools, aqua park, delfinaria and oceania.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, it can be bought in winter months because the temperature of the water in it is not lower than 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even hotter, and people buy it all year round.
The Dead Sea is the most outstanding sea in the world, located in the smallest sandy point of the planet - at 417 m below the cold sea level.
The water in it is found on the sun’s surface, which easily sustains the cold and people who are unable to swim.
The surrounding region is unrealisticly beautiful.
Take care here to prepare for treatment with salt water - salts, and a medicine bag that can treat the health problems with dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, constipation, diabetes, to treat the desired nerves.
Connect to a dark past
Protecting it was part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them she traveled the glorious sea route of Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The characteristics of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.

Tourist, Slovak
If you want to go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population is speaking in this country.
It's better to spend money on the road, not in the euro, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shoes (now about $1 is about 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is particularly busier, but in Jerusalem there is a speedy tram and in the city of Haifa is the only line of meters in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the mountain.
It's basically about the underground lan wire.
Traveling all types of city public transport is 6 cycles that you can drive 1.5 hours by driving.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the tabernacle is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to the west of the sun on Saturday, it ceases to work on markets, shops and public works.
And on Sunday morning, work week begins.

The country has visited from January to October 2012 to 118,8 thousands of Ukrainian tourists, 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the fall of 9 February 2011.
"Great and strong" will be announced to Moscow: immigrants save money in their language
While Members and defenders of human rights still debate the law on mandatory language tests, there have already been found in the country by drivers who sell "departed" certificates
There are 13 million foreign workers in Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities each year.
Most of them are central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support the family home.
On 1 December, he entered into force on the law, whereby every migrant worker will have to undergo a test of the knowledge of Russian language.
However, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, life-style and retail sales.
The FMS, however, promises that the appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, trials will consist not only of language knowledge but also of Russian history and the legal basis.
Language skills will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend labour permits.
A exception is paid only for the citizens of the country where the Russian language is official.
This law does not apply to any people who successfully obtained a certificate and obtained academia in the SSSR crash in 1991.
Use, assessment and protection of rights
The network of experimental sites will work under the auspices of Puškin's Russian Language Foundation, the University of Friendship among the nations, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petrohrad and other Russian high schools.
The migrants can run tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia today.
The initiative to support the implementation of the test was supported by the Ambassadors of State Duchy and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law entered into force, the defenders of human rights were able to ask the press a question: What does it really bring?
What change is required to know the language for Russia and for visitors?
In particular, the representatives of migration services are responsible - it is possible to reduce the number of people who suffer because of "the child labour."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, the President of the FMS Russian Presidency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
Only a system of organised assembly will allow 90% to solve foreign workers' problems.
Problems arise in immigrants without a call, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowing the language, says Sebelev's testimony, the prospective migrants are directed to the shootings with the wrong people who, with the help of the help of him, will ensure a "show" for the future, quiet accommodation in which he and dozens of others, like him himself, spend the whole month without food and documents and walk for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of trouble from our migrant workers.
"They promise one in their own hands, but after their arrival they will be taken away, they will have passports, they will not pay for their pledges," confirms the chief Thadzic administration of labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't give up!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who intend to work in Russia admit that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get, but have no experience even with the work they do.
Of course, this is not even their wines, such as more unhappy: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tadiks can afford to get at least an appropriate basic education.
However, their families also need something to feed their children, not to talk about the fact that they need to be well dressed, dressed and trained in school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they must be prepared for work on the first occasion.
Without knowing the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel low and low."
It is true that, in view of the law on language tests, they teach the protection of human rights on one important issue.
The test will only be carried out by migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even make any tests, or they won't get any more official jobs.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live the same as before in Russia illegally.
"Wow, or no permission to enter"
Many of the coming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization is money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false records can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we have basically false documents, without registration, and therefore there are cases of excavation.
"They require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared with journalists about his experiences with the citizens of Tajikistan, Meed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be easy, buy your furniture."
On the first day of the law on language, it was found that false evidence of registration was not the only evidence of migrants.
The FMS employees have already had several false testimony to the completion of the language test.
Shared evidence is printed on a standard color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get free: each of the migrants in hopes that they had such an easy problem with completing the tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times higher than the completion of the official test: this will become a migrant worker of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the closest future is to protect the system from corruption so that workers cannot easily buy evidence, in which they agree with government officials and human rights defenders.
Government authorities can still promise foreign workers who did not have the first test necessary time to complete the course of the basics of Russian language.
Visitors who are not Russians are expected to work in areas where active contact with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not engage in an illegal arms market
The share of criminal acts using legally held weapons is very low
The Russian MVD submits a proposal to strengthen the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the incident of shootings on non-victimated weddings, and a massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitria Vinograd, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which they can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This opinion supports the head of the Security and Combating Corruption Committee of Irina Jarova, who promised that changes to the arms law would be submitted by the State spirit in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the road "sharping".
In the network, an open letter was published by the authors - representatives of various community shooting organizations - called for a rejection of the "inspired pressure" law.
The percentage of fraud with registered weapons is minimal, Vasili Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminal in discussion with the Russian editor of BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 criminal acts were rescued in six months in 2012 using firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand criminal acts were recovered during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the enforcement of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not accept customers to pass into the black market.
According to their words, they can currently find a low-cost volunteer weapon in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the undertakings by the holder
"Black" arms market has been equipped with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranèc, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
A screenshot page that accepts weapons orders
The first one is "army or military road", that is a weapon that was detonated during the Kavkaze wars.
"The weapons were stolen and stolen by officials and their own cavities," Barantec says.
Other types of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals in security forces.
Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police funds and weapons stolen directly from employees of the authorities of criminal proceedings.
Unlawful "mainly" get to the sale of military funds.
In many military reserves, it is often due to explosions.
"It has been demonstrated that some fires have been deliberately placed - to hide the missing," said the former soldier.
They make their contribution according to Barance and the weapons manufacturer.
"At the same time, private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market will emerge and identify weapons that are being placed on the black market, including Moscow," said this expert.
Another source of "black" market is packaging.
In particular, a large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their product, sometimes weapons are produced here in small arms, and the Mafia that organized their oil production," explained the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
The Committees considered the relative share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
The report on this problem was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and Design of Public Administration.
Specialists have collected reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminal literature and information of public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, inform researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all the weapons appeared on the black market "the guilt of official perpetrators whose work is connected with weapons," says the report.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of armed conflict weapons occur, in 14% of cases the theft of weapons occurred in their production, 5% is "black archeology".
A salesman-consultant of one of the arms dealers who asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in black archeologists have not been bought - they're just too old.
Most often, as he says, salesmen drive for new savings directly to military funds.
Through the trunk, the interested party buys a unit, such as the TT gun.
You order a weapon in it and he sells it to you across the board.
"It takes it to the city and sells it for EUR 900 for the sake of two customers," she says.
"The truth is that the police are good in the picture, and that is why whenever they start to burn a plan in the explanation of criminal acts, they will carry out control purchases in dealers with illegal weapons," the counsel adds.
"Like in luxury shop"
The sellers with the most common buyers find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited the website and blogs until he found out the guy who offered me the chance to go to the "Test" platform, where there will be a man who would lead me to "kout", where we'll go together.
I knew the price, especially when it was there.
Military report Viktor Baranèc
If I want to get a gun, I need a man who knows the way out, he's gonna tell the salesman - counsel. - I've got such a well-known man, but I don't trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to prove that the daughter had a tooth."
And now I'm gonna get through the man I'm sure of.
He also gives them to me alone because he knows I don't take him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in various ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranč tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-90s when he was working on a post on this subject.
The schematics have not changed according to his word.
They gave him a photo album where it was "all you've thought about."
"I felt like in the luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranès, does not offer any interest in the search - you can try everything.
I, the potential client, just don't buy - we're going with the forest salesman and we're going to get a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and if I'm sure the gun shoots well, we're starting to do the same," says the expert's procedure.
Ingredient for storage
Searchers will bring you online to web sites and groups on "Vkontaktu", where you will be offered for the purchase of weapons "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a fixed amount of money," they write in a advertising title on the website "Buy a war gun or automatic".
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And sell me an airplane?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the document is stored).
"I'm buying TT.Moskva" - it's making a request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently decided to store a wide network of stolen websites and persons who are going to buy a military weapon.
People gather like hungry fish on the beach and then get oil on Siberia.
Military report and higher military commander Viktor Baranéc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered for the limitations of Russian laws.
People will take orders.
The buyer is making payments through the banks.
"In response to this, the salesman sent a photo and a description of the direction where the weapon is hidden," reports the press spokesman of the non-governmental organization "The Right to Weapons" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranč confirms that following orders are posted on the websites you can remain unarmed and hide behind the networks.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided to store a wide network of stolen websites and persons who are going to buy a military weapon.
"People laugh like cold fish on the ground and then get oil on Siberia," he admits.
Macarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, you will pay from $100 to 900, according to experts' estimates.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the non-governmental organization "Right to Arms" you will manage Makarov's guns for $100 to 300.
You have to wait until one and a half months.
The weapons shall be dispatched from the funds to the long-term storage via the funds of the medium Article.
According to the official statistical authority, in comparison with the summer period, in October 2011 the number of these criminal acts in Russia decreased by 7% and made 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of reported cases of theft and firing of weapons, firearms, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast food workers and supermarkets are active
"McDonald" works on the ground until the fourth of all American teenagers.
In recent days in America, there has been a wave of protests against the low walls in Walmart's hypermarkets, and in the restaurants of popular fast-skillers, such as McDonald, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still no one can predict whether this wave changes to the ninth wave, or whether it is about to disappear soon.
All this action is supported by the committees and a number of the left-wing community organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages that are received by workers in Walmart and in rapid distribution systems, the aim of protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their committee organizations.
At present, this economic sector is practically not affected by the Committee's noise.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after the day of thanksgiving, in a so-called "black Friday", when the organs of cheap producers were attacked in America, millions of people were arrested and, in some cases, were executed.
On this day, a number of Walmart workers, who work for 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and demonstrated together with teams and left-wing activists of international trading companies, whose goods are destined for people of lower and middle-class backgrounds.
Walmart sells all over the world, from the full through hunting rifles and car batteries to the sinker, eggs and milk.
The products in its sales range from 8% to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees with low wages in Walmart's sales are just buying themselves at work.
The availability and variety of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods in such a cheap way because he pays only a small amount of his employees.
They also suffer from poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic vehicles or manual scanners.
Democrats called for an increase in wages and complained that the health insurance costs provided by companies increased from $30 to $100 per month.
Typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 per hour, but it doesn't answer the costs, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley point out that if Walmart increases the average interest rate by $12 per hour, it will be the company's state of $3.2 billion annually.
It's an average of 1.1% more than this company is currently paying.
If Walmart's company moves an increase of more than 46 cents on the consumer's shoulders, each visit to the sale will be only a total of 46 cents.
This year, customers spend about $12,39 more than today.
Walmart's advocates point out that the protest only occurred in nine countries and the company should not cause practical damage.
"Black Friday" in sales companies lasted from 8 hours on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Her entire assets carried out almost 100 million transactions in the Black Friday.
The representative of Dan Fogelman pointed out in the discussion for the left-hand Huffington Post website that the workplace had abandoned the entire "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all "other media sensations" organized by the councils.
"Uncontained treasure!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where Walmart’s business houses were not the target (they are not too close to the city, so they are almost here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he's selling billions of pieces, and then he doesn't pay you for your clean work!
Yumane Williams, member of the City Council in New York
At the present time, the minimum wage for work is in accordance with federal law and New York State regulations of $7.25 per hour.
Fastfoot restaurants gradually raise this pig, but only peacefully, and they get their workers' order in New York $8.90 an hour.
No one's got a lower nose in this dear city.
I don't understand how you can live in New York for such money.
At McDonald's job, almost a quarter of American teenagers work outside the school for part-time work and live with their parents.
Only a few people look at their main source of life or plan to stay there longer.
At the same time, I continue to meet with staff "McDonald", who complain that they have to live with these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the wall of Wall Street Journal, there is a comment by the author that it is inappropriate to have children if you don't know how to hold them.
Protesters who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonalda" at 40th Street and Madison Avenue requested that the volunteers and cooks in the fast-paced companies start to get at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also requested the establishment of team organisations in the area of rapid urbanization.
American law prohibits the right to ban the recruitment of committee organisations and the presence of members of the committee's membership by putting up with and giving up.
On the other hand, they are managed only once they make life easier.
However, the introduction of a rapid classification of the team organisation is also complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusual high rate of staff.
Unsustained
This day, there were partial protests in a number of other smooth restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the action was in the afternoon meeting at the "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians appeared, especially a member of the City Council of Yumane Williams, who said, "McDonald" said that he was selling billions of pieces, and then you are not paying for your clean work!"
The demonstrators also expected the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate in the old city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must join the support of fast-food workers in order to obtain fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, as is required by each non-profit!"
As New York Times put it, it was the biggest act of his kind in the history of the Americas.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, although not all of them were workers of the rapid distribution that employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will turn out to be a sudden, ignition of the flame of the mass is still unclear.
"It's time for me to cry in the middle."
Among the fans of modern technology virtual reality is the popular theme of expanded reality; in recent times this means considering the world especially through the food of special glasses.
At its annual conference, at the beginning of the year, Google presented the working model of this news and it was announced in November that the application for an appropriate patent was also submitted to Microsoft.
The discussion with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies in Cambridge's company laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadim reveals that scientists in this company are already aware of the past.
It is easy to manipulate with virtual objects in the air with large hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us what's going on with your research team?
- We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we're trying to cross the boundaries of this interaction.
People are still involved in the work phase with pixels on the surface of the screen, especially when it comes to the fingers.
We want to look at 5-10 years ago and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect monitor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not available for sale without Kinect scanners, because for all it is a very interesting option to manage using a gesture.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred interactions to a physical level, a lot of interaction is still running on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow has not yet been particularly.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional education systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to get the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the users but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate way.
And in the first row - to hell with these stupid helms virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it worth it?
- Of course he can't be considered as anyone - there's a private question, because we don't always want to inform others about our actions and purposes in our environment.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for example, we had a project that we thought about gestures, but not about soft ones, but only for such short, expensive ones.
The gesta would then not make a camera, but a frame that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's still big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the frame hours.
Usually, however, it pays that the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + vote.
- And how is that?
- How do you ask me, for example, to give you this lemon juice?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to hire the user to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual bond.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of filmmakers that will be able to find out more precisely how people react.
This can be, for example, laser scanners that provide a relatively good depth resolution, which is very important.
- Do you have to talk about your work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough difference today, deep or something else?
- Based on the present generation - that's what we can do in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixels. It's like a mother and a brain.
At the same time, all the current technologies are insufficient for us - it gives us work for algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the difference in X and Y angles, but also Z.
So it's also very important for speed, the number of photos per second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 images per second are fairly small, especially for gestation.
Stephen Betisses from our laboratory in Redmond made a touchmaker with a adjustable delay of processing in lengths 1 to 100 ms, while at the same time, serious filmmakers are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects human interaction with the machine.
For me, it would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, not only do I need so much touch, but I need some pictures for a second.
- And there's no need to raise the number of cameras?
- In the Kinect system, three "cams" are now used, one of which is actually the infra-red transmitter and the other -- the receiver of the detected signal.
And already the third camera -- it's actually a very common filmmaker of the visible dog.
This does not apply to the location of the deep-sky object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or lower it because it would increase the required amount of the calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible kinect analogue system, to play with the closing position of the camera and to see how it helps to determine three-dimensional positions.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (in contrast to Google) did not present his glasses publicly.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of technology expanded reality through special glasses, is it one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, going and keeping the smartphone in your hand is not very convenient, but I think: the most powerful option would be a "transparent" kind of expansion of reality when it would be possible on the basis of the platform clouds to switch from the brightness to the smartphone, the projection display and the next step.
Brilliant - it's a very personal device, there's their strengths (you see only things), and at the same time weakness - extended reality on the basis of Braille does not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine the moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is a problem that criticism often indicates: there is no impact response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answer does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that extended reality - it's seven after each other's going to be in mutual interaction between the human brain and the machine.
I think the supplementation of math skills could slowly become eight.
At the same time, one of the interesting tricks is used - to use another hand as a particular type of background for the screen.
In an excellent way, it's recording the shooting!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding moisture to these "air pictures" - for example, the interference of several direct ultrasound paper in a defined point where the finger is located, causing mental sensation, but it's still very weak - as if you were looking at the edge of your fingers.
There is also a framework for safety that affects nerve endings in fingers - also a weak direction.
- You've already tried to cover up your brain?
To think he's feeling what it looks like he should feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
Here there is yet another challenge that will be faced for a long time - how to catch a man who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is fast open, practically infinity - we are also working on the concept of running trails (although not the same as in clubs), moving platforms as well as crosswalks.
If the brain is a goal, it's work for many years.
That's what does work on virtual reality so touching for researchers - a lot of things are in simple beginnings.
Experience instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the Petrohrad avantgard project, dedicated to the citizens who are in the head, are the avantgarde culture and art.
At the top of the list, there have already been significant figures of Peterhrad's design scene, whose expenses exceed the city's borders, often find recognition in Europe, without achieving all the glory.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is a playwright of Cyril Miller.
The whole city is known by Cyril Miller - a dirty man, who is all dressed in red, where you meet here in the Russian Museum, here in the summer garden, here in fashion shoes and on the vernishes.
Cyril Miller's poems, wherever they're presented, always touch the gifts of the monsters.
Cyril Miller is one of the clean social and philosophical petro-hedach reformers, the creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - it's an attackable man of the petrohrad avantgarde at the end of 80th and early 90th.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets produces smiles on the faces of the people, increases all mood.
He recently took a bottle and became a petrohedian philosopher, because he was raised to this complex role throughout his bohemic life, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you going all over the city in red and not in yellow or for example in Turkish?
- I've chosen a red color as a designer with a visual and image.
In this world, red color represents a compromise between artists, imagemakers and the public.
Maybe he's usually paying for everything that's just a little different from sitting down, being aggressive and trying to develop bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is primarily a call for discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
At the exhibition at the Cultural House in New York, where my work was performed.
I understand what's on my way.
At the time, the power of old non-official artists and new, free artists was beyond my understanding.
I've been friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasonics who brought us to the "Pushkin 10" and there were no other waves.
It's sweet to the beauty, the clothing, the music, all the genres, except the words.
- And all of this happened in your art clinic... - It was important for me to get to the center of Petrburg culture, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I founded a place at Puškinské 10, and before the reconstruction there was a musical and artistic club, a bohemic club, a peterburg bohemy house.
There was a lot of births: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Schnura brought along with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang under the cover of a light song, dressed in touching tricks, amid them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the hat started to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has conducted many Hali-galavsk programs.
We gave them Trachténberg, which started his great career, basic education, and professional training got from us.
Gallery "D 137", Gribojed's club - it's Art Clinic.
There's our employees and permanent guests.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture has anything else to do with it.
In 2000, a survey was conducted in print, a special price was "People in our town".
In the title "The Artist of the Year" I was named Me, which ended my height.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unacceptable, I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
In modern years, it's easy to get popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your works are characteristicly recognized.
- Many of my pictures - these are the hits in which life is affected by reality and predictivity.
I'm going to have a program show at the Russian Museum in the castles.
The clowns are over-time categories.
I used to be social, and today it's painful and terrible.
But in the clubs, everything's going to be done, it's going to be a tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have the grotesque thoughts.
For example, to save the world from the path of total repair in order to adjust.
Today people meet by clothing, focus on the outside mechanism, not on the inside person.
Or maybe he can't hand him a hand and he needs to swim in his face.
And the roof will be removed by a shift.
- We've seen you in the role of the city's flashlight. - The cultural city should have such a garden.
And who should have it if I didn't?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- At the same time, it should be commercial, useful art essential, tactical, sweet.
It's coming to an end of culture.
In the past, people were trapped in the mud, they loved one another, just another.
Today it's all broken down into microspyness, today it's very difficult to love everyone.
I'm not a hundred-year-old banker to love everyone.
We need to think about who you like today.
Today, every culture garden has its 100 fans.
- And there's a few thousand monsters coming to Stas Michajl's!
- He's got a boyfriend, he's having sex with the social area.
And there are 300 people on the cultural floor, and 10,000 people don't come, and as a result is less management, money, everything is bad.
I've got fantasies, the main thing is that no one's unscathed and doesn't give up what's in it.
When I was a young man, I drew pictures of a pile of stones on a wall with Falek and Larion.
I started with the pictures that most people end up with.
Today, people are often confused about ideas.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it's a division.
I am a man of cultures yesterday, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Petrburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: a factor in culture.
Not all of them, but they can live a culture.
In the days of the fairs, it wasn't like that in all, the emperors may not have understood the cultures too much, but they realized that they needed to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people who could be experts in Petrohrad, but they're being held somewhere in the kitchen because they need great experts who properly evaluate these experts and give them them on the right path.
He's improving his experience today.
Even Erarta, but it's wrong for them to honestly say that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for another museum.
- What do you think, Petrburg?
- Petrburg - it's not the main city of culture, in Moscow there's a lot more culture, there's this right land.
And at our top art becomes a bit of a waste.
We need cultural land, but today we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are strangers who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've only got this kind of bad.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented via the St.Peterburg grant
Rotate & Counterclockwise
The earth is in danger.
Global heating or cooling with deadly asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with land on the deck are on their way, looking for a restored planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: How to keep your family in a safe condition or on a given planet?
I don't think the choice is so big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetical.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a highly established scientist at the State Astronomy Institute P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is possible only at great altitudes or at the orbit of Venus... in the universe.
To answer the questions of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with flowers.
In the past half century, tests on plants have been carried out.
The four generation of game displayed on a regular drive is nothing like their earthly neighbors.
Then there was the release of a smile on the orbit - very small fruity men of Drosophyl.
In 1979, we were sent to the universe to check on how the embryo develops into a state of nostalgia.
We get an absolutely normal bird at the exit.
But then problems begin.
"The problem is that this bird has to find support, has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says the leading laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't find the resistance, the chaotitic birds will fall and do the drills.
Ten hours later, the pure-bred birds came to the most simple instincts.
Birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the problem was that they just disappeared in four days.
"Two times we let the birds fly, but then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them," comments the experiment with Kurts in Vladimir Syčev's universe.
The last "miniarcha" flew on a regular drive 16 years ago.
In January 2013, experiments will continue.
In the biosatellate, "Bion" but only the habitats of one sex are going to be.
He's been experimenting with the ghosts that were being sent to the universe already serious.
They basically didn't reveal anything that was overexpressed.
"It was only on biosatelites, but again - it's a unique experiment and such attempts should be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After accession to the country, the human race was born to the cosmic insects.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of proliferation directly in the universe.
It's a hard job.
In the absence of a normal environment, living creatures simply cannot achieve their own sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens is governed by abstract thinking and is capable of creating a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying to the universe for 50 years.
The biggest danger was the Tereskovs.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Chayka flew away and no one on Earth could say if he'd stay in the universe.
Is it possible to have a baby after such a year?
"But no one has answered this question yet," says the Vachtang Vachnádze, a veterate rocket-vehicle.
In June 1964, more than a year after a year into the universe, the first cosmonaut, Valentina Tèreškov's daughter, was born.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrian Nikolay.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-hosmonaut Savikka was born, who visited the orbit twice and also worked in an open universe.
But the risk remains.
We've only got a few cosmonauts that have been born and raised after many years.
"It can also be dangerous in orbital years," states the cosmonaut-pilot, Herdina Soviet Union and Herdina Ruska Valerij Poljakov.
People still have to search for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is required to prepare for the flight.
Here, in terms of zero-strength cosmonauts, the skills needed for work in an open universe are overcome.
The water looks like a lot easier.
The water for adults may be comfortable, but in a way that makes sense, for young children is a natural life.
Small ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is in the womb for 9 months and that it is easier to get to the water for them.
In principle, it is logical, because since the time of birth, from the moment of the first purchase, only 2 weeks have passed.
"It's very small to forget something," says the Newborns' navigation instructor Marina Axen's.
It is said - if the situation for the newborn child is more natural, then for women is more inevitable gravitational, it is a force.
In the state of safety, it comes very quickly to the freezing of the breast muscles, the muscles of the breast, the soft body’s ability to release fruit.
We can leave this on the other side if the stimulants of the muscles function at birth.
At the end of the term, it is possible for the offspring to pass through the special chamber in which the mother’s organism produces fruit.
"And what else?" says Valerie Poljakov's complicated questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
If it does not cause soil contamination to the organism, it cannot properly shape the bones or set up the muscles.
Newborns on a regular drive are not able to wear clothes as adults in a special suit that may be trained.
He'll just get rid of what he needs for his development.
"If we come with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a healthy person who will simply not adapt to a higher environment," recommends the lead committee for the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov bioethics.
So the separation of children in the universe is only a theoretical question today.
However, the time will come when the earth will become a reality and the earth will be transformed into a distant planet that will become home to their offspring born in the universe.
Head of the NKU: Control of the Blackness System has led to political wines
Czech has good control and quality legislation in relation to public legislation, but in its application.
This is said by Vice-President of the highest control authority, Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but must be correct in its application - that's what we think is missing," comments the current situation of Kala.
Similar conclusions also indicate common controls of Czech and German controllers.
As an example, incorrect practice indicates Petra Nequêse's access to the so-called "sharp system".
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said ODS would not be responsible for its controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be contrary to something, and if something is forbidden, even the President of the Government cannot prevent the exercise of the authority that is responsible for controlling and eliminating obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in Poland, you spoke briefly about the joint project between Czech and German sides, under which legislation on public legislation was compared in both countries.
What exactly happened?
It's about the parallel control we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that the European legislation governs how public legislation is to be resolved, followed by individual national legislation and then by the same practice.
We gave all this together, and even though the control is not yet over, we have shown very interesting differences - generally said legislation is perhaps "more accurate and more perfect", yet the practice itself is in some parameters better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to establish further and more precise rules, but it is necessary to award the right application alone.
What can this project do for you?
Such joint controls could contribute to our continued efforts to break down laws, reduce and overcome limits if they do not have such a positive impact.
The economy means getting the right thing to do (which does not always mean the least) price in order to avoid harassment and, where appropriate, criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the limit of the ban, we don't have to achieve it.
Perhaps this system is covered by such a multitude of "papers" that those in this system want to look for holes, so they're going to get a lot easier from it than if the limit remained higher.
You're talking about German problems with trans-legislative legislation on public law enforcement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office like our NKU here, or is it set up differently?
As for the authorities, like the NKU, the Bundesrechungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, is created in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices are acting similarly.
The powers are also similar to certain measures, although Germany has social arrangements, so these accounting courts and at the level of individual social countries - this system is slightly different from ours.
The BRH can only control social money, which we have provided by state resources.
The public resources that we are dealing with are controlled from the level of social accounting courts.
What's the darker legislation, so that's easier than ours?
I would generally not like to compare this without specific data, although in some respects Germany has been designated as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it is in all the better.
Is it even possible that they have better controls?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like this comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries we consider to be a model are facing a wide range of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be good for them to cooperate with our office, would it?
What about foreign legislation, which means the new law on public contracts for your office, is already in effect?
Given that the time of payment of this new one is relatively short, we are not yet in control actions.
Because we're doing ex post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
We note this only in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new "responsibility risk detection" tool through which we have passed almost 14,000 public bans, and we have analysed them - these changes will be made in understanding, because changes in limits, the conditions of some types of electoral management are adjusted and similar.
Do you consider accepting this law to be more beneficial, or is it a burden to the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that might happen here is that it's "swift" rules and it won't be possible to keep them.
For the purposes of implementing the previous rules, persons are subject to control by suppliers (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council) to the fact that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means a breach of the budget.
So does the law value that way?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not those who will allow formal errors that have no effect on the decision.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how's it going out?
Let's show you where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said ODS would not be responsible for the controls of this so-called blackmail system - and what does that mean?
The blackout system is banned or allowed?
The law must be contrary to the rules, and if something is prohibited, neither the President of the Government can prevent the exercise of the authority which is responsible for controlling and eliminating obligations.
He can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but he can't say we're going to do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, there are relatively strict rules as to what should be formally carried out - which is correct in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the best offer interests are excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be right for its application - that's what we're missing from our view.
The roads are open, but most of them are dry.
In a few places, the Czech Republic is surrounded by road and is also flooded.
Most of them, however, are rare, some of which have increased caution.
Done at Brussels, 30 June 2017.
In Karlovarsk, the train was busy this morning, but there were no places, and it was also snowed.
The temperature ranged between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day, it should be slowed down.
The cuts in the region have been established and there are only weak species in the subsoil.
However, on the shores of the Red Mountains, it is about 20 inches [30 cm] of snow.
Places were also less visible because of the hair, resulting from the data from the dispersion of the national railways.
The R6 speed lines and first-class communication are now extremely narrow in the region.
Caution is also in place, for example, on some movements where the surface can be soft and cloudy.
There are also all the roads of the second and third classes, including mountain trains.
But in some ways it still lies the remains of the cold and the places of the snowy snow.
In particular, there is a need to pay increased attention to the road.
Pardubic and King's Country
On some roads in eastern Czechs, the sea is threatened, in high places and on mountains can be the communication of the snow type, informing on its pages of the Road and Road Management.
Motorists protect drivers from cold, especially in the higher parts of the Pardubic country.
The discovery may be around Lanškrouna, Urtí nad Orlica, Polička, Svitiv or High Míta, especially on the roads of other third and third classes.
Chemicals have been healed by engines I/43 and I/34 in Switzerland.
Snow is especially on the railways in the Cronos and Orlic Mountains.
The known snow tribe is the highest in the Rychnov and Trutnov railways.
In the eastern Czech Republic today, it is most often clear until it is clear without a fight.
Temperatures are usually moving between minus three and plus one degrees Celsius, with low wind.
Plenty of the country of Plyzeńsk
The railways in the Plzeńsk region are busy this morning, but the areas with increased caution and driving need to be adjusted for a while.
It's a cold morning, the temperatures move between three and nine degrees below the ice.
After the previous cuts and the next cuts, some communication may be open.
Locations must also be counted with the slow, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is influenced by the information of the national trainers.
The D5 distance is almost unlimited, and increased caution is recommended by the communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the train's first class has dry and cold surfaces.
In southern Plzeńsk and Tachovsk, but there can be some clues.
Communication of the second and third classes is flexible and, in this case, it also pays attention to targeted actions.
Drivers should be cautious mainly on less frequent roads in the area of Samoa.
Oloman Island
The snowflakes on the train must today count the drivers measuring to the highest point of the Olomouk region.
After a chemical injection, she stayed on the Red Sea and on her way to the Videlsk Cross.
On the night of snowing, the railways to the plain, according to the road managers, lifted a hole three centimetres.
In other parts of the world, vehicles are mostly skimmed without restrictions.
"On Schumpersk lies in the highest levels of snow remaining.
The snow cat on the Black Sea must be counted by drivers in the direction of Jeseník," ČTK spokesman of the Shumpers administration of the train said today.
By night, their colleagues also landed at Jesenicka, where the highest places are now according to them after chemical treatment of the coal and the monasteries.
At Olomouk, the roads are narrow without restrictions, however, in Šternbersk, the drivers should pay attention to the forest trails where the vehicles remain cold.
Eastern Region, Liberian Region
Now a few hard-distance sights are being reported today by a passenger on the north coast of Czechia.
In addition to a few places with an attacked snow or ice cream, a mountain train from Telnice to the Book of the Ustecka is closed, is flown from the police database.
Temperatures are also kept below zero, so ice and snow are likely to remain on the roads.In the lows, especially in the south-east of the Czech Mediterranean, there are no problems and the roads are dryer.
The operating complications are not yet reported.
The lifts of the ice are especially reported by the railways around the victim.
According to meteorologists for her there were ideal conditions during the night - over the day of rain and silence, in the night, clear and cold.
The main conditions are also reported on road I/13 between Austria and Liberia.
The closing of Telnice to the Book of Books was pulled out of the wall of the walls of the trees, which were burned under the nose to the driver.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to combine positive energy
What do you think he's got to do with the end of the world in a few months?
It's just one of the other scary news that we people like.
Together with The Tap Tap hat, we do more fun and say that we're the only cable in the world that can collect enough positive energy to keep the world away or prevent it.
In the second half, you will complete a single project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to readers?
It's a global benefit action we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before December 20th, from 21 hours, three concerts are usually held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They'll end up on the island of Kiribati in Tichomor, which is in a 12-hour drive ahead of us, the Mayan calendar will end.
Who came up with this idea?
For the first time, it was probably my idea, and then we all thought together with our founder, Honzo Augusto.
In addition to trying to reduce the supply of positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the situation in which we spend this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also created unique collection of items of bots, triangles, boxes or original keys against the end of the world with their shopping on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap Tap group, along with other interpretations, also sang a blessed himm against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Destroyed".
He's already very popular on YouTube, is he also involved in these profitable concerts?
Of course, and it's in complete conclusion, so if everything happens to us and the end of the world doesn't come...
All three concerts sing it together.
Hymny is also immediately proposed in a unique direct transmission to Czech television.
The words of this song and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomáš Hanák, also in Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also work with other characteristics of the Czech cultural scene, since we are organizing a number of beneficial events and concerts...
We're trying to involve them in these projects intensively.
It turned out that most of them are interested in and interested in our company.
What's the competition for concerts against the end of the world?
For the preparation of the free school centre of the studio, which we have been working with the civil society Tap in the Jedi Constitution for six years.
For students of Jedličk's school, lecturers are regularly present and are engaged in activities that are interesting and interesting.
Personal students don't have the means to get out of the lecturers themselves, so we're trying to make it possible for them to do this.
In the context of the delivery of Jedličk's facility, the building will be built into a future independent building to which we are transferred by this project.
There are several musical groups and interpreters at each concert.
What did you pick her for?
We've been trying to establish a program that covers all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague there are Chinese, Support Lesbians, Illustratraphere with Dane Barto, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some kind of "bombistic action" in the future?
In May we will first go to the Prague Railway, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally would like to preach in the United States, with the release in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group that creates people's handshake.
How do you manage these roads logistically and organizationally?
It's not as terrible as it seems to be at first sight.
We have five members on an electric car, their cars have to travel in the back of the parking lot, and of course we carry a lot of costs and a band with a tool...
Nevertheless, it has always been done without problems, ČSA and British Airways have been well prepared for us, how many times I've been a fan.
Even in Moscow, where we had recently returned, that was no problem.
Thanks to exits abroad, you can compare how the individual seems to be free of charge, public access to handicrafted and similar.
What have you been dating for so long?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we were right in Russia to witness that in the east it is still in full beginners.
On the contrary, Moscow is a very barrier, where it is still unusual for a man on an electric car to move himself into the city center.
It won't pay for any of these self-defenses, as the driver should give you the lead in the race.
Fortunately, there are also civil society that is trying to alert people to the problems of reaching out.
And on the contrary, what do we still need to reach a more prosperous country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it is important to remember that perfectionism and improvement are always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with heavy handles move on their own to the public, can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever...
But it is not too common that a large number of people would be actively involved in social life there, in which we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or for independence is one thing, but even when important athletes, artists, priests, politicians or lawyers are among us, they start to change things.
There are still some cases of people who have a strong will.
Chapel The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but how many years did you have to put it back in 1998?
I grew up as an upholder of the Jedličk Constitution, where I had many young people around me who were interested in buying something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing other than the saxophone, so I've set up an interesting musical circle together with my colleague.
Well, in time, we're told by our moderator Ládá Angelovic, a bit out of hand (Laughter).
But the populace has arrived in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to propose famous songs and to work actively for the promotion of hats.
We were told that the work that is not seen was essentially not there.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also allow quality lecturers, training and so on.
Was your goal to add it to The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential for something else to be done.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one looks like another.
It's in its logical way, everything new is taken carefully and it takes a long time.
The things they're united are very small, but I'm trying to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first house in the person who sees us first is of course sorry, it's natural...
But this suffering is just too much, because people with Hendiquepe are no suffering for all the left-overs that we have to suffer.
They are people who can live a meaningful life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with Hendiquepe, it's not just for them, it's for the whole company.
Has it also helped you to be a good boss, as many people have noticed?
If we want to do a good job, we must be in many things uncompromising and demanding a certain discipline.
But that's what I think is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic picture and a head in the clothes, and when they find out that they have to go to the test twice a week, get ready and spend a lot of time on the way to the concerts, it's a quick release.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
At present, The Tap Tap chapter has twenty members.
How many of them were there in early 1998?
Just the only Lady Angelovic.
We're an open group, people are coming and coming, and that can't be stopped.
Whoever has a will and a desire, he always has the door open to us.
It will take effect before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 p.m.
Runs in Prague Incheba arena, Brnö Flédé and Ostravi Plynojem for the participation of 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities at the end of the evening propose telemots at the joint song capely The Tap Tap "The End of the World Destroyed"
The aim of the concert is to collect financial resources for the development of the multifunctional free education centre of STUDEO at the Single Foundation in Prague in the amount of 25 million Kč
The entrance to the concert is 400 Kč, children up to 12 years of age have free entrance to Bohemiaticket
Polish and cosmos.
Last week, at a meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the European Space Agency for the twentieth member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the country of the former Eastern block (after Czech Republic, which became the EEA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of agency projects over the years.
It's been a long time since Poland's journey to space.
The flight to space was fought by the six generals before the second world war; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the presentation of A. Šternfeld in Warsaw's astronomical observatory, which was presented on 6 December 1933 as an idea from his pro-copic work Access to spacecraft.
The opinion of the young engineer (1905) left the audience hungry, and after the years of Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received the price of Robert Esnaul-Peltriee and André Louis Hirscha for entry into space in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish journals, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became the world famous cosmonaut promoter and his profit was appreciated also by the fact that one of the craters on the stolen side of the moon was named his name.
In 1925, a railway train was set up in Poland, which was to be operated by a rocket engine.
However, the author of the proposal is unknown and we do not know the details of the project.
It's not even clear whether the rocket should be used to disintegrate or to steal it.
The information about this drawing is only known from time-print.
Since 1933, rockets have started to launch a Polish firing squad.
The study ensured that the Office of Arms Techniques in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolf and Professor Gustave Mokrzyckieg.
It is evident from the material studied that the research has grown into a state of practical testing.
The entire coming of the German army was interrupted by the investigation.
In 1937 he published in a professional press a proposal for a photoelectric powered rocket designed by engineer Rohozinski and the following year launched the project of Rakieta - a torpeda air and a rocket bomb by the author of Lely-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all draft military use of rocket techniques had been committed by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Timed Scientific Committee) which coordinated all work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after a two-year operation, it ended the war.
Further work dedicated to cosmonauts in Poland after the war in Poland is shown by the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polski Association of Astronautics).
The first is a list of companies in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problem, where there are four more detailed articles in the book of Astronauts.
In one of them, by Professor M. Subotovice, it is proposed to create a company that will remain cosmonautic.
At the time, the projects of the art community had already been launched and it was clear that space research was a perspective.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has sought to enter the International Astronautic Federation (based on 1951) and has already become a proper member of the PTA.
And next year, PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became President of the International Astronautic Federation.
This function remained until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 PTA has been involved in the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Meterological rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and came to the first start on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with access to 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, the perfect version of RM-1A was established and in 1959 a two-year RM-2 double-entry rocket test was launched in the Bladov desert.
Raqueta was a length of 1,4 meters and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Another type of development should already be capable of real scientific work - RM-34 rocket should have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor high wind.
However, further development was discontinued in 1962.
The next first RM rocket became the Meteor-1 rocket developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a dual-use, its overall length was 510 cm and its initial mass was 32.5 kg.
Three types (defined Meter-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which have been reduced to the size of the scientific equipment.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was available a space of 0.4 litres, a Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and a Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
Maximum access to all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 he attended the Meteor-2 Institute for the Development of the Meteor rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Raketa Meteor-2 had a starting volume of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The subsequent versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were established.
Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also joined the Interkosmos programme in search of space for Soviet art companies, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercom monasteries of Vladimir Remkov.
Dissemination of public works law is not a solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court broke the law on public works.
A public discussion of life has resulted in the adoption of the resolution.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic barriers, national economic systems, are in a permanent conflict between them.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free movement, nothing limited to the movement of private capital together with a sound financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in labour prices is due to price pressure.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import the cheap goods into the economic competition by increasing the price of the competitor with a view to increasing its market share and increasing its own profits.
In the mass scale, this means that most businesses are either to transfer the product to the country or to buy it directly or to lose it.The result is high unemployment in countries where job prices are higher compared to other economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and also the responsibility for unemployment produced by it, the social costs of the State are rising necessarily.
The whole situation makes it easy for the employers to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage that has been inflicted on them in the interest of profit.
The situation is so generally known that specific statistical data should not be provided.
Independent private capital practices are created in individual economic situations when governments of individual countries are required to enter into mutual competition with the aim of reducing the social level of their own citizens with a view to attracting foreign capital.
In other words, governments give their own citizens their own capital, regardless of their social progress.
This is particularly evident in the changes in the laws of paying.
The aim is to ensure that its own citizens accept the price density of private capital, in particular in the Mediterranean area.
This is, however, a provision for a long-term unemployment benefit, but a restriction on the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with growing differences between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN, there are already several years of public expenditure for poor people who cannot use their own jobs.
The number of these people is up to a million already.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people to get the right jobs so that they have to be paid to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal has also been published in the case of auxiliary social workers.
Practical measures of all the southern EU countries will undoubtedly lead to the same situation when people are forced to migrate as they were in the 19th century or to live for cold winters at the edge of society, hoping that a private investment capital will come to the country at least once.
Where do you need to ask where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty is moving from one country to another, or it is not coming at all, because China, India, Brazil, or Turkey, Morocco, or Egypt or Africa still work for the European breast.
It's all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to economic disaster.
The sovereign capital of the Soviet Union is based on the view that the state must not be bound by the rules governing the economy.
It should then be asked whether private capital does not affect, now it is in fact guiding politics and the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here's a unique answer already.
The evidence is practically powerful and in all the states of all the different lobbyings.
As a result, there is a reliable situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, by law enforcement, where practically everything is criminal but not criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that the State ministries for the lack of financial resources are tasked with developing proposals for laws by private legal firms which are very useful in linking industry.
These legislative proposals were then adopted in Bundestag.
All these powers do not come from people as they vote in Western constitutions, but from the financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting to the situation, as Appianos describes in his part of the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has been in complete disbandation for a long time and the authorities have been involved in violence.
For payments, illegal acquisition, and using stones or swords.
Subsequent complaints and corruption broke out without any arrest and people went to the polls with the pre-sale vote" ..."the characters did not even know about the authorities, so one day the result of this revolution was eight months without consoles." "The effect was that the only drug in the bad situation is self-government and that it should be chosen by an energy man."
The conclusion, as in the past, is that the current society is based on independent preferences of its own interests without regard to the overall interest.
The private capital is no longer able to understand and apply the overall benefits from its foundations.
The result is now, as at the time, an unprecedented decade without any effort to reform the deeper race.
We must therefore look for a causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the independent liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
At the same time, the legacy of these systems in favour of liberal democracy may be considered to be a certain halt with the expectation of another car.
Especially disastrous is the fact that modern elites are completely ignoring possible statistical losses in life, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnesses to crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new events.
Dissemination of public works law is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of economic competition at both international and internal levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
So this trend is system-wide.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that strengthen the capital participation of the State in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.

After the last wave of violence between Israel and the sand of Gaza, a number of reactions arose, as always.
One stands for Israel, argues about his right to self-defense, and the Palestinians join the role of terrorists, others support Palestine, argues the racist state of Israel, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel stands for the role of a terrorist state.

Some of my views are supported by the available historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who is resp. whose group is the main cause of the events of modern history.
People's actions are in the first series of acts of violence.
In every era, we can look at something like Alexandra the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always those qualities that simply guided their steps and whether or not they were someone who directed their actions towards the stated goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that the money and the power that flowed from them could not come into the lives of a single generation.
Among these astronomical rich families is one that could be considered to be the head of the chocolate shop (if anyone still stands above them, but I don't know) - Rothschield.
They don't care much about them.
I understand.
The first printing agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s to stop linking its name with high criminal effects, which always meant the accumulation of power, the accumulation of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the central banks have no leader or war preparations (before the attack by Afghanistan, 7 countries were, after the attack of Iraq, 5 countries were left behind after the invasion of Kaddáfi, but between Russia, the central bank of the Russian government.)
Whoever tried to fire this family died.

The first war was to remove the great monarchy in Europe, the second had to remove the colonial pantheon, especially the Great Britain, and the third had to reduce the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of children for their comfort and luxury exist and do not need so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (communism is no substitute for such a solution) and the final transfer of absolute power.
The method of the group of the poorest families in the head with Rothschieldy is the development of the crisis and the following solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED Foundation to prevent the crisis from recuperating as it occurred in 1907).
So after they had been killed by the Habsburg successor, R-U, who had to tell Ferdinand of the first world war in Sarajevo, the Russians destroyed the Russians by defeating the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended in a state, war and economic inexhaustible, capitalizing Germany (no longer needed war to destroy Russia) and subsequently resulted in the breakup of the Central European Power, Rakouska Uherska.
In order to facilitate the discussion of the second world war, the Bankers allowed the situation of the latent conflict to be created in Germany by a series of war reparations, which were created on the basis of the radicalisation of the bidder masses, and then were only able to support the Germans with sufficient strength, wines and simple solutions offered by the Leader and further the creation of the international Československa with a strong German minority that was to be assembled, and also the fifth column, with the blessing of the war fire.
By the end of the 19th century, Rothschield’s establishment of the Synod, one of which was based on the creation of the Jewish state, was favored in the area of historical Judah and Jerusalem as the capital city (turning back to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour's declaration created a premise for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine, beginning to arrive at the first show with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks were on both sides.
A second world war was launched if Hitler broke out of the grid on which the international bankers had held him, or everything he had done in his plan was difficult to predict, however, the suffering of the Jews in concentration camps created a premise for the acceptance of the Jewish state of the world community.
Israel was officially established in 1948 and, like Germany’s military repairs, was committed to World War II, Israel’s declaration of the Third War created a fire.
If the international bankers are able to report it, the Jewish nation will, like the second, sacrifice in the first line of wars, now together with the Arab or the general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, a source of energy and chaos not only within the country but also at international level (we will only take care of people as the people are on the altar and reject Israel).
Who is the vine and who is the victim of the Palestinian - the Israeli conflict, where the root of the scourge is producing violence in an endless stream of violence, when, at the beginning, the greed of individuals and their attitudes toward global power?
Here it is necessary to separate the people of Israel from their leaders because, like us, international banks support people to choose their own elections.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, international banker of loyalty, a policy that does everything to resolve the war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), has threatened the transition to global conflict and the control of Iran over the Hormusian sex, which runs 20% of all the world's mines (the flood corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now is the word that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is the general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their image is the world of gentlemen and children.
A world where the rest of the human population serve as a comfort to the hosts of financial aristocraticism.
A world where every new born unit is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a fully controlled habitat.
"And urge all the small and great, rich and poor, free and children, to have on their right hands or on their heads, so that he can not buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the snake or the number of its name.
That's what you need to understand: who has the mind to count the numbers of the letters.
That number represents a person and that's the number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he collected the donations of Islamic students from the American Embassy in Tehran and placed 52 diplomats as handy.
They were allowed to be replaced by the devoted uncle Mohamed Rézu Páhlaví, who returned to the United States after the revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - the walk across the ball could not be allowed, because it would undermine trust in allies in other countries.
The release of arms, however, in Iran, where the revolution was released in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not possible.
It was the morning for the U.S. prestige, which later deepened the lack of attempt to free the arm of the force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after which the Algerian government granted an exemption.
Their actions in the home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-violence.
Debakl in Iran contributed significantly to the failure of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film of the ruling priest Bena Afflecka Argo describes one episode of the history that America has brought about a small victory.
Just before the embassy was removed, there were six employees.
After the complex perpetrations, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian botanist.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to obtain them from Iran, thereby helping an extravagant cross-section of history - divided into Canadian passports as members of the film's state, which looked around in the country for the discovery of scis-fi large film.
Ginger combinations
The plan, which was designed by the expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez, also called for Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the legend reliable, the film project was written in specialized stores, the press conference was organized, and the firm had a real office.
The details of the operations have been delayed for a long time, the film comes from Tony Mendez's memory.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, a realisticly familiar political triller, such as "caper movie", a story created by a box, a statement - can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film, the performances - on the one hand are documentedly marked sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence they are shown iconic contemporary photographs of the event and how the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in it).
On the other hand, it's a remote passage from Hollywood, accompanied by ironic and peaceful overcrowding.
And then still scenes from the CIA center and other institutions - men in the clothing are taking care of the situation at the same table, at the offices, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had an amazing way to start a career.
From the laughing priest, he became a respected director and his legacy ceased to be the purpose of ironic notes.
Argo is his third weekend film, after the dark crime of Gona Baby Gone (2007) and the triller of City (2001).
It's also the first Affleck's picture that doesn't play in the director's house Boston.
The city's atmosphere was also marked by the characteristics of the director's older films higher than the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is also performing it in Argu, where Teheran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the initial sequence of the disaster of the embassy is reflected in its perspective, which at the same time reduces the sense of loss and inevitability that occurs when the action is taken somewhere cleanly.
Similar effects of Affleck and its employees are found in the scene of thought (false story on the Tehran base).
You've done a lot of things in too many places.
The director had to agree with the fact that the story was not really a big deal in the film sense of film scenes.
She's quite successful with this little thing, sometimes she's actually thinking about something - it's not going so elegantly there (the scene in which the terrorist crisis on the Teheran airport opens the phone in America and the honeybee after the race is quite hairy).
But Arga's weakness is the disappointment that comes from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the role of Hollywood employees of the network very charming, but their positions would serve more space and are not alone in the film.
Affleck's film is so much losing dramatic silence, it's a picture that can be followed with a peaceful interest, evaluate the realization and retro style of the exciting thriller's 70th century.
But it's just hard.
As a reminder of a long time in a certain way of living history and evidence of how it has been translated about all-powerful and conscious secret services, it is becoming.
Balcony, bananas and circuses rules
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which issues an annual questionnaire on the most questionable bank payments, has now decided to issue a competition on "the most absurd regulation or opinions from the EU".
"It has led us to this last event when the EU plans to adopt 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the legal editor of the Patrick Nacher survey.
Among the so-called absurdities, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to merge the rate of insurance for men and women has already been made.
Women in the prices of environmental insurance have thus far been vulnerable because they are less likely for insurance purposes.
"More incredible ideas from the EU can be designated by the end of the year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013,” Nacher informed.
The EU Competition Regulation also includes a requirement to bind biofuels to low levels, resulting in damage to the environment, further prohibition of the use of common root temperatures only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances or the directive on the size of blind cells, as it has been clearly observed during the year.
Critics in the past also issued an actual ban on the use of the term of wine butter or the definition of classical grapes from sale.
High-quality bananas have 14 centimetres
The Union apparatus shall often decide on the pressure of either the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually met by a state or group of states (so Czechs now and at the risk of the storm comply with the requirements of their banks).
The interests of the Lobes remained because, for example, bananas had to reach the highest quality in the Union at least 14 cm long and should not show "anonymous coverage".
The European Commission has also protected itself from harmonizing only the existing unanimity of national standards that complicated trade.
The standards concerning fruit and vegetables already exist in the EU through the resistance of some states to the fact that the existing directives lead to food pollution.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also be a lower EU regulation, which requires the caution that children under 8 years of age should not smoke without consideration to adults.
The EU has called for an American research, which states that ballasts among toys lead to the cause of the death of children to breathing.
Similar restrictions now apply to children up to 14 years of age when they are breast-feeding.
Curiosity is born at home
It is quite absurd, then, to speak of the rule of the individual European officials - everyone in the EU who has an official function cannot use the name Macedonia with regard to the sensitivity of Greece and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Jugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with Laissez Faire, the Banking Tax.com server designated the association of the liberal economies in question in addition to some of the abovementioned suspects, and the Union regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established maximum levels of food supplies that could be found in the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czechs then crossed, for example, the fixed volumes in the preserved holes, which threatened his high score.
The organizers of the survey also urged the idea to pay to some country for their lack of sea and the idea of making an application for a grant.
However, these attacks did not take place in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are disabled by having no sea.
We ask the European Union for refunding," said the previous Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CHSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that we had a lot of greenery and that, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, there had to be a full fund that he had to carry out.
In order to continue its accession to Czech Republic, the EU had to pay a million euros per year according to the Palace.
Finally, the European Commission launched a campaign to organise a tender for the purchase of greens from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant grant was offered by the local Ministry for Local Development, managed by the German Minister Paul (US-DEU), and in particular they had to apply for the grant from Brussels.
EU: External regulations are exceptional
The regulations in the Member States are easily becoming the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, more effective functioning and development of the Union's entire development, according to a number of experts, deserve more recognition.
The most serious problem is, according to experts, the EU's contribution to projects which have no sign of any European integration, but which have been excluded by Member States in the budgetary arrangements.
The emotion between the Czech Republic also raises the fact that, like other Union countries, the ČR in Brussels must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, which does not always succeed in this package.
After six years of fighting with the Germans and the Rakushanis, however, the Germans had to convert their producers into the Turks.
The name of the room can only be produced from trite distillate and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of EU-registered products, feta and gorgonzolic acids, marcipan from Germany, or Parmsun, have already been identified, for example, carlovars, peacocks and peacocks.
The EU's protective mark can also be used to swirls and hot tubs.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man attack that he wants to apply to the president?
I don't care to be a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I won't be able to apply.
But I can't see how the last twenty years of the country's collapses, how the more the thieves run, the more people get paid and the age of retirement.
I shouldn't have been a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I was four years old and I'm independent, I have no choice but to apply for a senator or president.
You've reached Senat, but you've put your interest in the City.
Don't you mind the people who chose you?
I've been saying I'm going to war on the City as a result of the senate elections.
Later, I made sure that if I was elected senator, I would apply to the president.
My goal, but it's not working, it's a tool that I can perform my vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest command.
The problem, though, is not only that we as a people spend our time in the home and on television, but that we're going to mislead anyone who wants to try to change.
This includes the media that detonate people and who lie about freedom of speech.
I may have been told that I'm a journalist or that I was the counsellor of Jiří Paroubka.
Let's go see you.
In the fight against the City, you have expressed this heavy and criminal responsibility for politics and back ownership over twenty million.
That's what you have to change the law.
As President, you do not have such a right and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I was a citizen who liked to make the leadership a free life, it was possible to do so.
The problem is politics - if a person comes with a good idea left or right, he's going to stop, and the citizen keeps it.
As an independent neutral, I have much greater potential to receive support from all the parliamentarians.
My priority is that without a page-catching and teaching I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you think you're more interested in a human right or a left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that I have a lot of people sleeping on the left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little transport.
It's important for me to go ahead.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if the KSCHM or ODS propose it, and I will also resist bad thinking.
You'll be surprised when someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Someone can call it populism, but all the suggestions I've been talking about are already in the world, or they've been talked about by significant experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll be left with only the words.
And you won't be long enough in politics.
Or do you think that if you go out with people and talk to them, you might be able, for example, to pass on punishment and heavy responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them to our side so that we can change them.
If I were elected by the President, it is no problem to arrange a direct television broadcast, where I would ask the President of Parliament to legalize a substantial and criminal responsibility for politics, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they should somehow tell her why they don't want her.
If there's a strong personality that's going to name things, you can press on a political scene.
Take the President's direct vote, that was the subject of public pressure.
At the level, I say I'm an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my views and visions, I'm trying to look for connections.
I started politics first, and I'm trying to get a lot of support for my program.
I'm trying to fight myself, but it won't work, I'll end up in six years, and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura should save Czechs.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not doing anything in one person, so I've been running a number of famous people, whether they're not candidates for the Senate.
I went after Radim Janchuro, who refused because of the amount of work he had done.
So at least I supported the research journalist Jan Lorenco, who was covering the ruins with light-temperature oils.
I've been praying that people are really uncomfortable, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people didn't go to the polls, and those who went were mostly elected representatives of the institution.
We're just two independent in the Senate.
People called the Senate so that the changes would be difficult.
Still, I'm going to fight for my vision, for example for the direct election of the elderly or the Hettmans.
Do you consider setting up your own page?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the pure history of every potential customer, and I don't even have money for it.
I don't have any money on the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about property recognition, what's yours?
I'm looking for some 60 million real estate.
In Prague, I have a 25 million gross, ten million, another eight million, an art collection of about ten million, Aston Martin a 3.5 million, and Scotland Superb a million, and then I have a few million on account.
By the way, aston Martin is because it was my boyfriend's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against evil and incompatibility.
You drive Aston Martin, you own 60 million and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to give your own money to it.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Is that what I owe you?
I've already killed 2.5 million people in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors testifies to the fact that my program is probably not that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for my campaign.
The costs of the campaign are basically covering what I'm going to get to the senator's pay.
But I wouldn't take it from him, for example, I couldn't pay for the children of the English school, which is 30 thousand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be a candidate.
So you'll still be a business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're going to slow down these activities?
But it doesn't match the higher wage.
As I promised, my activities were partially wasted.
For example, a traveler will become my representative on the street.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will protect the Republic.
But I need to live with something, too.
How many of you as a businessman were used to taking a month?
Two hundred and 400 thousand, I'll take it.
And if I were the president, I'd end my business.
The entire discussion will be found in the Saturday issue of the Law.
The MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures do not only play in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently established Hora books - 2 photos
"This building seems to me happy, it seems futuristic. It's finally a sight of something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the corner of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technique in a nearby big business, says, "Well, this house is nice."
But I wonder what we still need today.
Everyone has Internet, iPady and electronic books.
None of these old-style books are available today, are they?
Spijkenisse, sitting in close proximity to Rotterdam without his own job opportunities, which are not even for a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest education rate throughout the Netherlands.
In order to deal with this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was to contribute to general education and to establish seven beautiful miniatures of railways which are displayed on the Eurobanks.
The successful educator of offenses, but he wasn't ever back.
And so the working community realized that there is only one way to become the lord of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architectural workshop MVRDV, a master of brilliant sloop graphs, and a manufacturer of funny, often even cynic buildings, accepted things with normal ease and at a competitive meeting in 2003 he appeared with five books under care and a challenge on his face.
And while the Commission was still seriously looking around, and the branches were cut off, the dear Maas made his gifts to himself according to the size, and his active words ended with the words "Dear City Towns!"
So this is my proposal to Horu books in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, 30 million hours were completed.
It is part of the revitalisation project, which also belongs to the underground park, supermarket, mail and several nearby residential and network houses with a total of 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, Hora was listed in the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also named at the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small town now that has never been able to offer more than the post-modern spree zone and an unusual scalding worker, for whose white façade you would rather expect milk, is a little more rich than modern architecture.
But above all, he now has Spijkenisse's first public cultural building in the history of his existence.
Long journey to the nest
First impression: the reader's elegance under the cover of cheese.
By means of the mass of the mountains, the network runs out, but you will find real space and readership very well until you reach the topography.
On all sides, the interior is bright and transparent, the floor of a hot cabin and elegant street lights clearly express the atmosphere of the public place.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park stars, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere are books, books, books.
"Normally there are rules with books under the fascism and in the middle is a big dark space, which is most unusable and personal," says Winy Maas.
We've set up a classic space configuration and we've put space for the reader inside out.
Inside Hory Book is widely used: in the center are offices, online libraries, chess club, ecological centre and central home technology.
In particular, the police are black police on books that are once walled, once parapets and once infamous drawers.
The look, the structure, and the smells are causing a strange thing.
They even attract architects and construction engineers to the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, leading project in the city of Spijkenisse, on a standard magazine question.
And that's how we found an appropriate waste product from agriculture in one French agricultural company one day.
For many years, it has been used as a base under a millimetre root from synthetic weight in the forests and in the fields of the Netherlands.
It's cheap and timely.
The dry textile will hold one, two seasons and then grow up to be removed into a vast waste.
For the library there was rhouna - first in such a quantity - placed on the hard disks of four centimetres.
The groundbouwplastic (KLP) is produced in a dark, homogenous and burdensome material, which flows a little as a new car and a little as a sports boot.
You'll get to the top after 105.
At the end of almost 500 meters long journey, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquettes and flowers.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in the top literature.
Deal a new card
"If you don't believe it, but this house is, despite the fact that it's a large scale of evidence project on the environment," says Trouborst.
He's getting out and cold with the earth's heat.
Though the Hora books stand under a cloud, the light of the sun is only short inside, and it is even in the sun's days.
A wide range of beautiful wooden beams, which stand all around the glorious phase, serve as a stopover and capture a large part of the sun’s warmth.
The air in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of them are fully automatic.
Stefan Spermon, the original IT branch sceptic, has already visited a new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there already.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even marks Boekenberg as "a long-lasted soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Each city citizen was invited to open a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This should be the first to be filled with optical measurements not yet fully equipped with a library, which currently numbers 70,000 pieces.
The concept was confirmed.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than an empty book," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every citizen now has a certain relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just on the back.
The MVRDV took place in a royal discipline called the creation of identity in a professional garage.
Spijkenisse's writer of literature.
Let her be young and uneducated.
It's the end of an exit point for identity.
Sound: "The Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany continued to vote in the decision on the adoption of Palestine.
According to the expert on relations between the United States and Europe Stephen Freeboa, Berlin is thus balanced on the hard food of diplomats.
Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week first signaled that it would vote against the proposal on the observer status of Palestinians in the Organization of the United Nations.
Then Berlin held a vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now Germany must be aware of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think he doesn't even support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held a vote in connection with the establishment of an annual zone.
This is the end of NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand on major international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it is simply changing its foreign policy, and that is the direction from the policy so directed by the United States, to the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult than Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They're expected to play independent roles, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just moving in their role, but they're on their way to "normal" foreign policy.
To foreign policy, which they have in France or in Great Britain.
In particular, what is the "normal" foreign policy from the German perspective?
It shows the willingness to take action in the case of national interests and the existence of which are independent of existing US or European partners.
I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, hence export and its relations with certain areas, whether Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are in certain respects different from the economic interests of others, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Were the economic interests affected by the situation in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
For the first time, Germany has a large settlement in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to intimidate the public, but not even the elite in the Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
I don't want to mention it, but it's not quite a unique relationship.
However, it plays a significant role in the German occupations at any time.
He damaged Germany's relations with the United States when Germany held a vote in favour of the two important decisions, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as Libya's question.
Some Germans even challenge respect.
This also indicates that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has made it clear that he's sorry for the wind.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always been due to American internal policies.
I think Obama's government probably has considerable understanding of the European position.
However, because of the darker political situation, this position cannot, of course, stop public.
I think that differences in views are not really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and the Ministerial President Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very much involved in Netanjahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its difficulties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what bothers the Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they can't be part of a wider line and have to take things from their own position instead.
They're just doing it with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future and will force Europe to a European existence.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of Israel’s relationship.
It was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
See Germany itself in the role of a significant international player?
Or is the lead role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not normal, it is still unacceptable, and for this country it is still difficult for obvious reasons to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always as Germany takes a greater role, the anti-German regimes will emerge.
That's not easy for the Germans.
This is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for the most diverse neighbours and opinions and it's not easy.
The US's influence on European politics is still closing, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the present time.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them, and he's doing it to a lot more unpleasant.
Stephen Szabo is the representative of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, U.S.A., where academics and policy-makers from Europe and North America jointly study the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Freedom is also a member of German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German policy, foreign policy, the United States and trans-Atlantic relations.
"protected character" in China: when Puma and Armani are Chinese at the same time
Armani is a well-known symbol, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What's Armani Polo?
It is therefore hidden from the designation fully officially registered in China, but there is nothing in common with the original company.
However, it uses protection for as long as real owners do not regret it.
And even then it's not clear whether they're right at home.
"For the race, it is still harder to protect its brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violating security rights in the Far East.
Every week, I'll get a new case on my writing table.
They already have a few more letters to be able to record their characters.
From Gucci's marks, for example, Lu-Gucci will become and instead Prada will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way the German companies have been legally copied, perhaps the manufacturer of Puma’s sports goods.
Pattloch will open the list with the Peking's sign office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company was allowed to protect the trade mark Zegna DF Puma. An artificial name that also stands for the fashion house Hermenegildo Zegna.
We know that China's masters are the world's masters in copying and breaking the spiritual property.
In large cities, there are several retail houses in which shops are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases are different. By entrusting its mandate, it is against the fact that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use the marking that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpia", a combined sign.
This word is meant to be "Bang Dakuan."
There's so many women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages trade, we have to destroy it," calls Pattloch.
"The sign is split, the excellent position disappears, the damage to the image is huge."
Financial losses and court costs incurred by the companies go to millions, especially in expensive products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest market in luxury products and the fastest growing market, with a market of 15 billion euros per year.
However, the collection of missing records in the register can be difficult and something is involved.
The motion may be delayed for up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch reports cases when the court dismissed the complaint, because the name of the complaint became long-term "market reality".
When he has a regretful party, he still has to pay the plaintiffs because he has damaged his sign in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes he's breaking the law of the jungle.
The known cases are also related to the graphic primates.
In 2009, Daimler won a legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sany's construction machines, a company that recently took over the German steel producer at the Pitzmeister concrete mill.
Chinese people today can use a emblem that resembles Mercedes's star.
Geely's company, who bought Volvo, originally used a modest logo that remembered BMW. The track was rented, Geely had to change the logo.
Manufacturers of the fashion product Lacoste lost in China with Hong Kong and Singapore, who were known for their procodes in the wrong direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO network will agree that there were insufficient staff and space in 2010 due to the lack of a large number of employees.
But in the last year, it was reported that "the process of working has returned from the emergency situation to the normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed procurement arrangements amounted to 22 per cent.
There were 57 000 of these cases closed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting at the office for 81,500 more devices.
Something against that is expensive.
As it is often in China, these are impressive numbers.
In last year CTMO was granted more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the mark, which is almost a third more than 2010.
It's a record and it means China's set up for itself leads to a list of new reports worldwide.
It also pays for the number of all payment security signs - it's up to 5.5 million.
In 2011, there were 1.8 billion Yuan in payments.
Simply this means that each statement in the average is 1280 jones or less than 160 euros.
There are several ways to start this conflict, as the case of a German family company Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarists for more than seven years.
The Germans have found that his illegal production of imitation car parts has been destroyed.
However, the distributor has guaranteed Chinese rights to the Freudenberg symbol and continues.
We would remind ourselves of this because in Germany there can't be a protected name, says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO's trade mark office has also forgotten the company's acquisition.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg received the right, but the fighter continues today.
It's important to pay attention.
Now the case is delivered in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that this will lead to a good end and honor the professionality of the courts.
But she also says, "The driving is extremely expensive and we have a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs cannot be calculated. In the archive, companies had even had to look at hundreds of years of old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg's company, on the contrary, offered a "high six-six-pound share in the euro" for the purpose of combating.
"You see what that means for us," says Wentzler.
He's afraid that danger from the Far East will affect Europe as well.
And it's in case the imitators make sure they don't have any protected marks.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to sign Freudenberg for meals and skin in Germany.
This area of business has long been abandoned by the group, although it has been able to withdraw the registration.
"There's a need to pay serious attention," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch lawyers advise German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law. The foreigners would rather have "all the ways in which they stand for protection, to report to China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
The result: if Freudenberg's company in the final performance of its drama is subject to a sign, then it will probably have to pay the licence fee for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be in the dispute segment pushed out of the market.
World Day Fights Against AIDS: Smoking, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Impura Congregation is being tested - and in Switzerland, orphans are happy to be among those who have died of AIDS after their parents.
A connection time that exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, it's a shower: Kovboj's high boots, basketball boots, ladies' boats and panties are looking for a ticket park and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then, gradually, the voice of songs - al, bass, tennis and soprano - moves, moms and each other.
The 29th-year director Fiete Hopfa is almost twice the size of his textile boots when it connects the voices with his particularly wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music scene of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbuntu congregation is trying a new song.
There were dozens of songs and songs between the ages of 23 and 69, from the study of human genetics by the home.
"Om'Obani" is not easy to record, each assembly voice has another text and is also in very foreign languages - the gold spoken by tens of millions of people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Switzerland.
Help With Self - Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Prevention Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of that 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Switzerland there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents died in AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, he found a group of Voices for Africa’s bosses in Germany.
70 of them visit the second grade school.
In 15 or 20 hours a month, the pattern may be taken.
It guarantees a school, school uniform and one hot food every day in the Gogo Centre.
The iguns are called "the storymaker" or "the one who loves."
No one can speak in this room, just sing.
For almost ten years now, the congregation has been singing songs in this foreign tongue and has often brought back to where they originally came from: to Africa.
In the air distance of 8,733 miles [8,733 km] from Heidelberg, it is still in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of the village of Esitjeni, which is dependent on the ability to vote in the German congregation.
Forty percent have been infected
There are 2,000 people living there, some still in simple slums or broken lakes. Most of them are children.
More than 300 of them don't have parents anymore, because they've infected you with HIV.
In Estonia it is seen in the small one, the capital of Sweden: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest expected life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The clothing of a male predominance, which is apparently lowering the risk of a semi-trailer, does not allow the public to accept.
More than four percent of people in Switzerland are carrying the virus of weakened immunity in themselves. There is no reason to die in less than three decades.
This village appeared on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. However, in particular, Impuri members saw many children on the streets that lacked not only parental care but also clear everything: food, clothing, education.
Without finished school education, they have no chance in the poor country.
At first, it was a private meeting of individuals who were able to send a child to school for a few hours each year and give him a warm meal every day.
A year later, however, a group of Voices for Africa was established, which has been the ageing of orphans after parents who died on AIDS, almost professionally.
Fact about sexually transmitted infections
Who are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI contains syphilis, chlamydia and gonorea.
The common viral PPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes gential or hepatitis.
The mucus and mucus belong to the parasitarian SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most successful?
Syphilis and pigs are primarily supplied in men who have sex with men.
Robert Kocha's constitution is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany have been transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases often resulting from chlamydia infection, trichomonade, candidosis (plysin), lung and human papillamavir.
HIV is relatively small among heterosexual adults in us, but 20 per cent of the new infected HIV population belongs to this group.
Among young people, Chlamydia infection is more common than in other groups of citizens.
According to European studies, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, among young people, there are often human papillamaviruses.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to Robert Kocha, the number of reported syphilide was more than doubled by 3698 disease in 2011 from 1697 disease in 2001.
The number of new HIV infected people has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
It's about a decade less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause joint damage in the area of genitalia, stomach problems, vomiting, subcutaneous pain and diarrhoea or chest pain.
Often, however, no disease or other symptoms are caused and therefore remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Dangerous orders can reduce condoms, however, do not offer 100% protection.
Because the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted and infection from unclean and difficult physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, particularly in the case of frequent sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of timely diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the PPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charity gifts, and in the endless series of honoraries that the congregation is making to sing throughout Germany, some money is collected.
"We have already sent a total of 200 000 euros to Estonia," said the president of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is spent in the unique village of Zodwa Dlamin, a woman of course who can move.
It's also about finding adult children, for example, some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the U.S. language says to the old women, they're the defense of the neighborhood.
Some of them even took 14 orphans, gave them shelter on their heads, and took care of their children every day in school uniforms.
Children who no longer have any children go to Khanisile, a single woman who pays the same as two cooks who spend more than 200 hungry children a day.
"Voices for Africa" also founded a school of milk, set up two kitchens, and together with the American health organization PSI, arranged that many people in the village would not have done a HIV test.
Even though the disease is so obvious in the whole country, everyone grieves about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in the country where the king officially holds 14 husbands.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his unusual lifestyle.
Let's take the place of democracy.
This country's approved way of life is also guilty of the rapid spread of HIV virus in the past decade.
But there are many migrant workers who have spread the virus throughout the country.
Annette Lennartz says the condoms are on every corner free of charge, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - an unprotected relationship."
To support the cultural exchange at least a little, the Impura Congregation travels once and for two, three years together in South Africa and sings songs full of charms, war, faith in the future and of the blacks themselves, many in the south of the black continent are still familiar with the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing in black words - such appreciation brings not only joy and happiness but also tears in many wild foreign soldiers.
The road always leads to Estonia, where singers visit children over whom they have a patriot.
Even though you'll find this village on maps, the Esulo River is more than famous.
"Go to Estonia, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is here with an air force of 8733 miles, to the dulciful songs in the experiment at Bergheimer Straße, you see that light shines even here.
Messenger: NASA appeared in Merkuru Led
Sonda Messenger found evidence that it's on the planet Mercur ice.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercur.
Although the nearest sun is located, there is also cold water, as it derives from three studies published on Thursday by the expert journal "Science".
The Sonda Messenger found evidence that there is ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent wall.
This is reportedly a minimum of 30 cm and possibly up to 20 meters strong.
This water came from all comets or perhaps from asteroids that were found in Mercuri.
Let's not give up, but find ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said the leading scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature at Mercuri can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, research may help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Sondy, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unscathed landscapes, participate in the study of deep space.
From time to time, the pictures go to Earth, a small stream into endless gifts.
The picture comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Maxe Planck Institute.
Eight planet our solar system, besides the patient planet Ceres.
Just like Pluto, which surrounds the Sun surrounding Neptune, Ceres is not according to the new concept definition of the International Astronomy Union of 2006 "planeto".
This expression from the infrared picture of Spitzer's telescope shows "family portrait" of countless stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the proud are red-coloured "noorozed" on the birth of the star.
This area, where stars are created - scientists call it unromanticly W5 - revealed Spitzer's telescope in the vicinity of Cassiopeia in the distance of 6500 light years.

One of the largest and most accurate images of Hubble's telescope: viro-galaxie
The pictures of spiral galaxies, according to their color, are made of actual artificial parts.
The exhibition, published by the European South Observer, depicts a few thousand light years of a distance from the Trifid valley to the Stargate.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "tripidus" (distributed on three parts, three-fold), because dark red dust makes the heart of this star family to three parts.
In the universe, the astronomers photographed the discovery of cosmic weapons: in the distance of 400 million light years from the Earth, a woman is a woman of two moving galaxies and has to come to a wheelchair.
This creation of stars recorded Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like the technical cuts can call it a south windscreen.
The photograph of Hubble's spaced distance shows the appearance of the Iris valley in the vicinity of Cefea.
These 1400 light years are composed of work miracles, which are ten times less than normal domestic wages.
This picture was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It displays a ring from the black walls, which is a distance of 430 million light years from Earth.
This galaxy group, called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space remote view for NASA.
These larger spiral galaxies are called UGC 1810 scientists.
In this star valley there is the smallest group of the young stars of our Milky Way.
The star’s orbit gives rise to new developments.
Also this starship, associated with the voice of Rosette, is still born of new stars. They are 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this clear-cut galaxy with a little black hole there's no rain yet, it's probably just fluffy.
Scientists believe that it was just a short time after the Great Cross, when it was a major guide throughout the universe.
Our views on the universe: the most important telescopes
The remote view was apparently found in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Even before Galileo, he used it a year later to observe the star.
From that time onwards, the perspectives of optical distances have increased - and the views that are centralized are still deeper.
The world's largest remote spot was 30 years old, and it was from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope to the observer Palomar close to San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
There's a Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, U.S.A.
It enables you to observe the universe using two telescopes immediately, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescope Canarias interior on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. The view is only about 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to meet the costs.
Still, his average reaches a depth of eleven meters.
The failure of the left method of construction: the telescope is secured by a lift in a high position, which limits its mobility.
In the upper floor, the telescope Hobby-Eberly has been fixed in Texas.
His particularity is the high strength of the light path.
Despite the relatively small scale, it is equal to the world's largest telescopes.
Radio telescopes in Arecibu (Portoro) provide scientists in the universe with international signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - search for foreign intelligence - it can help any computer owner who can provide its accounting performance.
Review of the observer for the European South-South Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andean Islands.

This remote view with a full four-eyed view can also highlight the middle-infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large distance is also planned for the ESO's Chilean observer.
Its main mirror shall have 42 meters full and shall be composed of about 1,000 mirrors.
However, the pictures can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's remote views of the Hawaii Mauna Kea were considered to be the world's largest by 2007.
They're offering two glasses, each with an average of ten meters.
The Czech remote sights are part of the Mauna Kea observers, who, in addition to them, observe the universe and help the telescope Subaru and the IRTTF.
The Mauna Kea also has a new range of telescopes - with a diameter of 30 meters.
Here you can admire her on the picture.
But the most significant experience in space, however, is the medium of Hubble's space remote view.
Since April 24, 1990, we have been provided with distant worlds.
The space telescope Kepler leaves March 2009 after extrasolar planets - especially after those that are native.
2 February 2011 NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
The picture contains the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The spacecraft James Webba (JWST) will be launched first in 2018 to the space on the Ariane rocket deck5.
The primary surface of the space inframinated telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Great Cross.
The scientists come from ice on the south side of Mercuri.
However, there is no reliable data for this because the Messenger is traveling along this planet far closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have been showing for several decades that there is ice in Mercuri.
Thanks to the Messener probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first one that runs around Mercuri, scientists are now in security.
Eat butter daily and live 168 years

There's even a long-term museum.
Looking for a step in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live in Bible times.

Looking for a step in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'm going to get a ride up Talish. We can call a romantic divorce.
Microbus is calculated by means of a series of multi-trailers along a wide range of deep-rooted peaks, wooden rivers, and simple railings.
Everything's green and fun, almost seems to be in Schwarwald.
However, this is the largest in Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here, the Caucasian ethnic group of Talish is living, which is not too well known, except that it speaks the perfect Persian and Azerbaijani language and lives very long.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is surrounded by too much monumental architecture from the Soviet times, which is not going to the small mountain region.
Tourists from Europe don't travel here. The arrival of the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, is very difficult.
It takes eight hours to 323 kilometers because the train is just one way.
The richest land for which the thankless oil in the Kaspic Sea has not yet reached me on the outside.
However, Pilate Fatulajev (48) is convinced that Lerik is about to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the great price of Eurovision in May - and we will have the oldest people in the world this year," Fatulajeva says.
He's the director of the long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a documented life of about eight tucs of Talish from around which are older than the year. Fatulajv shows a black photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he still had a baby.
However, the bright star of this museum is the shepherd of the Şirali Muslims, apparently 168 years of age.
The birth certificate does not exist yet.
And given that the oldest man of evidence was 122 years old, Islam's age seems to be quite a mistake.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
This man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he still had a daughter.
Did not Shirali Muslim mention his age for a few decades?
However, he also heard about the flight people in Central Asia, Rembrandt Scholz, the gerontologist of the Maxe Planck Foundation in Rostock.
"A lot of people of advanced age also live in certain areas of China, in Japan or in the province of Hanza in Pakistan," says Scholz, "and in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men."
However, there is no scientific evidence of age due to missing foundations, especially when the matrices are missing.
Every day the cut-off butter is released
The fact is, people in the area around Lerik are often experiencing the Bible’s age at an alarming rate.
There are currently 20 people who are 100 years of age.
Then why does he live here on the south of so many people?
Azerbaijani translator Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special genes of Talish.
The director of the Fatuljev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's starting to happen.
However, the very calorific taste of Talish, who love meat, bread and, above all, milk products, and many of which drink the cuts of the left butter every day, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, it does not seem quite reliable.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps the young people young? In Cgegemeran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik, is inhabited by Rubaba Mirzaev.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young in this rural area.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He's sitting on the ground with a hammer that doesn't seem to work.
Under one roof, eight people live here, except one of the sons of Mirzay and the daughter.
Two little children are coming along.
In the kitchen, a tea is prepared for guests, which is presented in typical dry "armad".
The white teeth of Mirzai make a perfect order and under the hat are hidden a long dark blonde copy that is hidden in front of us by the hill of her son.
I always washed my hair with milk, so I didn't look like it and kept a color.
"I've never used champagne," says Mirzaev.
Monthly Life Retirement
She always ate only what came out of her own yard, lunches, hamburgers, games.
For the rest of my life, I didn't even buy food in the supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was the second world war.
But everything got better when the universe took over the "loved father" Geedar Aliev.
The propaganda sounds from the mouth of an old woman strange.
However, the cult, which is built around the image of the fathers of the nations that ruled his country as dictator, in Azerbaijan does not know the difference.
He was in power by 2003, then took over his son Ilham's wedding.
Old people in Azerbaijan don't have to suffer at least.
Mirzaeva gets a monthly salary of 230 ments (about the same amount in the euro). This is to a greater extent the amount from which it can be saved.
And maybe he has the truth even a long-lasting son of Mirzay: "Old people live in our culture with great importance."
They live among large families, they are loved, protected, and happy.
If that's not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
I understand "human rights" in the constitution is missing.
The revolution came back to Kahiri.
Indignant demonstrations in Cairo revealed a deep dispersion of the country.
It is a matter of urgency to discuss the future institution based on the right of the sari.
The Egyptian president didn't shoot the path.
We need to create a transition.
"And because this happens to us, I'm responsible, before people and before God," he said on state television.
His word was addressed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Capts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular people.
All of you, now hopelessly questioning the suspects, they're afraid.
Fear before "God's State" on the Nile on the mercy of the strong Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursey almost apologized that he had repeatedly limited the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own ways to "save the revolution."
However, a 61-year-old engineer who has a doctor's title at the U.S. University in southern California wants to save a ship, and there is no clear Egyptian world.
Should the court be free of power?
Paragraphs 234, which have been approved by the Constitutional Assembly with the movement of Islamists shortly in the Pentecostal night maraton, are partly alarmed.
As in previous articles, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "laws" mean?
This was and is an explanation and it can be feared that Islamists are using this unclear formula and associated legal space for a more precise explanation of the scarier.
At least this explains the new added paragraph: In all matters relating to drought, it is necessary to consult with the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great impact on the entire Sunni island.
It does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy will carry out a review of the law, which would actually bring justice to justice.
There are many things in the proposal of the Constitution
The problem is also that civil law of military courts must continue to be maintained.
These courts served for the Mubarak government to deal with the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As they suggest, the state should also protect "the right foundation of the Egyptian family and support its moral and values".
This is explained on the legal basis in such a way that by this paragraph, the State institutions can even control the content of film art and literature.
It doesn't mean anything but censorship.
Finally, no paragraph provides in writing for the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the prophet Mohammed and his dispatch.
However, it remains unclear what Hanobe is and how it will be done.
It's also mistaken for the wording that it's prohibited to "injurious people".
Is there already a presidential charikature or a joke on the account of right-holders?
The explanation, as many others in this proposal, that must be submitted to the signature and, according to its words, will be "very soon" to present to the Egyptians for the purpose of human vote.
"The revolution has come back."
A few weeks ago, opposition to the violence of the Islamists was formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in extraordinary abundance on Friday evening at Tahrir’s place in Cairo and were willing to destroy the constitutional document before they started to pay.
"The revolution has come back and we are welcome," said Hamdin Sabbáí, who settled in the presidential elections in third place.
The Nobel Prize winner and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradj announced that the proposal of the Constitution is "in the event of an accident".
By means of the short news service, Twitter accused Mursey's allies that they want to carry out "a fight against democracy".
"If the referendum is published, we will go to his palace and pick him up," said opposition officer Jasir Said.
"We're not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not wasted," said Egypt's media of opposition policy Chalida Ali.
A number of judges announced that they did not want to look at the referendum that would be free of charge.
"The Koran is our institution"
The well-organised Muslim brotherhood, however, did not show up in Tahrir, but after a united prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Kahir University.
She was attended by a number of lasafi women and supporters who called out, "People demand the use of God's law."
They said: "Purity to the earth." And they said: "The Qur'an is our due station."
The battle of superiority over the symbolic city of Tahrir, in which everything started, was likely to trigger a similar civil war.
The Murseys obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim brotherhood declared that the opposition and the rest of the motion for a resolution had been voted out and made quite clear.
Now it's time to let people in volunteer hours decide which direction the country should go.
Most are certainly considered in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear at all."
The constitutional dispute that should, in fact, continue to go on to the uur and integrate all the social forces, reports Háfize Abú Sa'du.
The eight-year human rights defender and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) denied the members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in or before the court of Mubarak.
Not because he would share their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
That's why he was killed, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now there are no words 'human rights'," she complains in the conversation for "Welt am Sontag."
The forced expansion of power on all three potential components in the state has brought this right to the withdrawal.
These measures are a scandal against democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Where the president forced the civil society, he actually broke it," Sa'da laments.
However, democracy cannot function without the organisation of civil society.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which follows the ideologieal fraternal competition on the Nile with the mix of consciousness and enthusiasm.
It could be his turn.
The demonstration on Tahrir's place warns: "You've created a monster that you can't control anymore."
Norwegian fishing: The world's largest fishing?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's secret of success be linked to the local appetite for highly fishing fish?
Take a few overcrowded cheeses.
Place it in the center of the collection of spinal and soft photoball equipment.
Let it lie for a week.
So you'll get these paralysing raffles, one of the biggest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, three hours from Osla.
There's snow, beautiful view, and in the air there's an all-embracing atmosphere.
Rakfisk is an isolated pstrophied in water for up to a year - depends on how much you want the fish to swim.
As it wakes up and starts to be cold, Norway here in Fagernes is starting to celebrate a festival dedicated to what it says the best, most appropriate food.
"Drink it acids and then drink it to a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional cook, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival's activities.
All around us people eat little bones of fish and drink a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit rather than a raccoon," Havard says.
The pot can pass through the pipes.
I'll try a few kisses.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a sushi shirt that was on a long road by bus.
Rakfish is a very different product in Norway when it was poor, and because there were still no refrigerators, the fish on the ground were trapped in the airstrips with water and salt.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well dressed, they came out and had breakfast, and the meanings of their prayers were no doubt filled with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norways were forced to leave their country and find jobs, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% create immigrants to attract a large number of jobs, high rates and a wide range of care systems.
The Swedish people, the old river, which was still much richer than Norway recently, are moving to the country for work.
It is considered to be something important, unsustainable, even though it is a relatively impressive part of the Norwegian past.
Patriots are among the most expensive items on the market.
Even though the treasure is all - small beer or sandwiches are going out for 9 pounds (14 dollars) per cup.
Norway does not often receive worldwide reports - and it seems that most citizens do.
The name of Anderse Breivika, a right racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still talking about the lack of hunger.
Instead, the shooting is called the 22nd July event.
Norse can only find it hard to believe that in their dying country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
With the current wealth of Norway, one of the world’s largest iron and steel industries has grown since the early 1970s.
"But the rose is not the only reason why we're doing so well," she says when giving Tallers with a lyrical inscription on our Anna, which with its long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes represent the prototype of the Nordic leaf.
We're, as you're called, very thoughtful people.
Its English, just like the English majority of the older people, is simply free.
We don't talk about it. We don't like the show.
Norway is very careful with its gross wealth - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for the future generation.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial crisis distributed money that they did not have, Norway had a strong grip on their masses.
"As long as we can lie in winter and go on vacation, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfis," adds with an old-fashioned smile.
I'm standing in the snow at the front of something to eat. I've got enough raffles.
That kind of burger is definitely something else and it's pretty funny.
But tonight's a fascinating fish back here.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where coffee is served for dinner and where guests love the best, or more for whose most important fish.
They have a connection to a live television transmission, where the modulator is a model surrounded by a raffic workshop.
It's like a Eurovision competition.
"What skin do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our boots, Howard."
It's called a smile and a smile.
With the seat of a fallen man, maybe made of water.
Or maybe all the fish's explosions.
Enrique Pena Nito from Mexico has a hard start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take over the office, Will Grant from BBC is looking for the challenges facing him and for the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that has been hit even in these best times, steel barriers have been blocked by closing several key paths into the main city and moving on the streets of chaos.
The aim, however, was not to prevent those coming to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sheriff and take over the leadership of the people.
They're carrying out their mission.
Mexico has been leading a good economy during the mandate of Philip Calderona, but the country has been in the early drug wars, which have already taken 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Nito of the United States President Baracku Obama of the United States at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he joined the American president, President Pena Nita gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old home, the people and the vast state of the capital.
A real man.
For example, in the foreign city of Valle del Bravo they remember him well.
Its citizens contribute to the development of tourism in airports and infrastructure development.
To the city you can now reach one of the new distances that Pena Nito has left to build. These distances are a huge improvement in the transport of wood and hilly roads that were here before.
The discs with his name also ascend to the walls of the modern sports center and the impressive interactive museum with thematic climate change.
"We expect to make a real and lasting change," said a friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state envoy on the side of President Pena Nieta, a Party of institutionalized revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was fired by Vicente Foxe.
Ambassador Olvera acknowledges that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there is much to expect from Enrique Pena Nita.
And he rejects the statement of opposition that characterizes the new President as a human being without a basic content.
He's a very friendly man, very busy with excellent views of the country.
He's a great statesman, and he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the idea that he has from his former governor of many people.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, there can be no contrast with the narrow streets of Valle del Bravo.
The property of Mexico’s own capital, located under the remote entrances, is well remembered.
And the problems in the self-righteous city are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was allowed to help control drug gangs operating in four quarters, especially armed violence against women.
Only in the last two years have the bodies of slain women been buried in the deserts along with the huge debris of waste.
During the time that Pena Nieto was a governor, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, much more than in the Nooristic violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is a symbol of the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pena Nieta say that during their actions in the office, she went to the office in an adequate killing with the problem of the murder of women.
And in the worst case, they blame him for shutting their eyes.
In the concrete house, typical for the fourth quarter, Irene Buendia shows us pictures of her beautiful daughter, Mariany Luny, and tears her tears.
According to the official version, Mariana lost her life in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I got into her house, it seemed as if her body had lost someone," said Mrs. Bundia.
There were marks on him after the shots and there was a death blow.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross on which is the only word "justice".
However, this is exactly what the family says, exactly what they were told.
The state authorities were treating me like I was old-fashioned, pregnant, and pregnant.
They want you to just take what they say and kiss.
"But it can't be right when it comes to such a mistake and I remember," he says.
The Sherpa, which will be held by President Pena Nito on Saturday, is entrusted with great responsibility.
In the last six years, dozens of families in Mexico have been subjected to violent crime, and the new president has promised that within the time of his action in the office, his priority will be his.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was a governor," says Ambassador PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what families are afraid of in Ciudad Neza.
Bradley Manning didn't insist on wrong behavior, military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's claim regarding gross behaviour in the race.
The hearing is intended for Manning's stay at the military service in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be suspended on the basis of gross conduct with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the army of Bradley Manning, who is accused of the most secret material in the history of the United States, has missed a lot of opportunities to rely on a cruel attitude that he has deliberately endured in the military battle.
The military prosecutor of May. Ashden Fein, at the cross hearing of Manning's army at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Maed, Maryland, said that the records of the weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the units during nine months of military service in Quantico in Virginia show no difficulty in misconduct.
The cross-examinations that occurred during the hearing of the proposed refusal to prevent a case against Manning due to a serious behaviour during the period of pregnancy, which was itself a self-sufficient party, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in the case.
An analysis of military intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
Material was posted online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the fifth hearing, the military prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, passed a form filled with officials after meeting with Manning in a federal prison in Quantica, where he was held in the regime with increased fear from June 2010 to April 2011.
The officers of Manning asked questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday at this form, Manning admitted that the behaviour of his guards was considered "excellent" and the overall behaviour in the device was considered "very professional".
The forms do not show any difficulty in the wrong behavior, even though the officers of Manning directly asked about how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that the concerns relating to the various problems were expressed orally and that the officials who visited her spoke to him about these concerns and pointed out that they were going to be killed, however, these problems were not recorded.
"There were no "no problems" (after they discussed the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manninga why he did not consult his own person in January 2011 when meeting with the Commission regarding the suicide concerns which he had expressed in the form several months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury".
The army indicated that it used this restrictive regime (one step under the control of suicide) for its protection and security of others.
"I wanted the audience to know that I was okay and that I wanted to break this treatment regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it here," said Manning.
Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq on Thursday and transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to the federal prison on the basis of sea voyages in Quantico in Virginia in June 2010.
He said he was looking at suicide in Kuwait, and once he thought about it for the sake of heat.
He indicated that he was not allowed to know what was going on with him and what was going on in the surrounding world was very appealing.
"My world just died on the base of Arigjan, on this hill," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning pointed out that after coming to Quantia he spent most of the day (minimum 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in small ones without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one matrix, cover, nicknames, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleep or just lying was during the day against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He realized that if the guards could not see his face when he turned around on the other side of the night, they would wake him up and have to turn around.
Manning's legal representative made formal difficulties with the Manning Army in January 2011.
Manning was sentenced to military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned the charges raised in the fourth hearing concerning the fact that after he had been sent to sleep for one night at his destination in Quantica, he was also forced to stand naked before the guards and the other colleagues in the morning counting.
Manning told him he wasn't allowed to hide his cover.
At the fifth hearing, Judge Manning indicated that by order of his guards, he had found that he had a cover which could be closed, but admitted that no one had given him a warrant for his resignation.
On Thursday, Manning told me he had been taken to bed last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning indicated that the officer said he could use a dog from his underpants or his summons to hurt himself, but he didn't do it.
Manning told me that this night he was removed from his target by his lower work, his nicknames and his glasses.
His legal representative hopes that he will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that in the case of his testimony before the military court, which is expected to begin next year, he will significantly reduce his punishment.
The defense indicated that he planned that Manning would confess to the crimes in lower criminal cases and that he would fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to deny the necessary conditions as justified.
The Pentagon introduced a declaration that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all detainees detained in connection with the maximum threat.
The charges against Manning include aid to enemies, unlawful means of publication of reporting documents on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If he is charged in all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient opportunities they have.
The Mexicans have to blame those who left; they remember hard times, they say.
Navarette says that Mexican Americans are lions between the two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital city of Mexico, I barely passed through the roof and I got to the immigration agency room where I found the problem.
The chips pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexico" ("Mexico") and the other for "Extrajeros" ("Cisinci").
I stayed there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life was called "Mexico."
It's an ethnic short, just like my friends in Boston call "Iry" and my friends in New York identify themselves as "Italian".
So later I ended up marking the Mexican American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need to use cuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to control both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I don't have the vocabulary of my mother-in-law and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I took off my American passport and set myself up for "Extraneros."
I was thinking about the time this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House of President Obama.
The programme had normal concerns when leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Penna Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same possibility that Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they move to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and full of enemies' feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and led its leader under the threat of arms to sign half of the Mexican territory in the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in terms of time, not minutes, the memories are universal.
So a minute after the U.S. representative will say a little bit of a criticism about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite difficulties about how the Americans enter into the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezum are going on a war trip.
And yet, for Mexico, this real development is related to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about enemy feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who offer opportunities to the country, and others who don't.
One reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that in some of our family trees there was a person, maybe a parent or a relative who had an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seems, this person was responding to the profile - dark skin, poor education, the cause of poor neighborhoods, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we're living in an American dream now, we're going to good schools and we're having a good job, we can never forget that we're living an American dream, not a Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And yet we know that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeats and see us as a sub-racial race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our journey to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is based on their opinion only on seduction.
If our families hadn't settled in Mexico, they'd never leave her.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped by a vicious rival, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and when she was born legally in the United States, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexicans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexicans don't.
Even though he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time a lot of Mexican Americans, I know, don't feel like anyone.
We love the Mexican team, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You're gonna get the best out of both countries, but you don't even have the roots in one.
He's looking at us in Mexico like America.
And in the United States, we are considered to be Mexicans.
And to make matters more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my flight, want to connect with the diaspora again.
They want Mexicans to work for Mexico as a "professional ambassador" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American citizens how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to establish relations with Mexico.
No, no, no, no.
That's not gonna happen then.
You've got a lot of enemies' feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of revenue and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's on you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a year and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still do not feel the way their family members were connected in the near future.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the pillar between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain foundation for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabia and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another cycle of blood transfusions indicates that every such accident is serious.
Among the usual remnants of those who began this, many buildings were transformed into heaps, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most civilians, and six Israelis. And the first came rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city Jerusalem.
But even though it seems that the Israelites and the Palestinians experienced a long conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab yoke has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis whether they like it or not, they are caught in a heated chaos in the region.
Maybe that's why their war will be more bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to think that this can prevent their dying condition.
A war that is neither won nor won.
At first glance, there seems to be no reason for optimism at present.
Even if the stop of the bomb closed on November 21st, the wars of this week were forced on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, an Islamic nest that has been ruling in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have led the Israelites to leave, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
And by killing some of the leaders of Hamas and closing the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most sad and most perpetrating places on the planet, Israel did not allow Hamas to be destroyed.
And actually, Hamas gets the influence of the West Coast, the next coast of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his busy rivers from Fatahu, the more peaceful Palestinian fraction.
In addition, leaders of Hamas can be very well aware that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world had a greater influence, so Hamas gained a strong and rich friend.
Turkey, a renewed regional power, which was once the closest Muslim relative of Israel, added to Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in Zaliv.
The prominent people of Hamas say that the Islamic semi-months are slaughtered around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the ruling party/milicy of Hizballah, across Syria, where the rebels who continue to cling to Islam, can meet Bashar Asad, as far as Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king.
And above all, on the south coast of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursey in Egypt, far from the most harsh and harsh Arab country in the region.
Husní Mubarak, a secular desert who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood is the brotherhood of Hamas and its leaders are more influential than the public.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as a player who cannot be expelled from Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israeli residents of the hard line will come to the wrong conclusion.
In military terminology Hamas was put back into bed.
Israel’s anti-traitect system of iron copper proved its price, and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
The Israelites could sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unchallenged as ever. Many European countries also won Hamas from the beginning of the last cycle of violence.
And above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahua, the president of the government, who ignored the peace process most.
Although the rockets from Gaza killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, in Israel there were relatively calm from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall, the main part of what the Palestinian state might once be, and protecting the Jewish forces that continue to grow, despite their prejudice against international law.
The Prime Minister of Netanyahu, whose side of Likud, at the beginning of the campaign to vote on 22 January, joined the more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in good position.
Why would you let the wealthy Palestinians go by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Coast, they wouldn't fire rockets like they did their natives in Gaza?
It'll be better if we hold them for that wall and we'll kiss them when they blow their heads.
The remaining ones may win hard lines, but the Arab yoke can change their props.
Although Muslims who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have enough love for Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defence expenditure is higher than the total expenditure of all four Arab neighbours.
The launch of a new war with local sovereignty will help the new Arab government to heal its economy.
The fact that President Mursi worked with President Barack Obama to achieve the stop of the ball is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also take a long look at the situation.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates a violation of Palestinians' right to self-determination with the gun job that has to be fired one day in the areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that blew up last week in Tel Aviv.
In modern times, the repression of the Jewish state of democracy and democracy still worsens the situation as the Arab population grows.
Blood attacks against Gaza, which take place every few years for Hamas' arrest, will continue to select a diplomatic tax.
Both parties need tenders outside.
The answer is what wise people on both sides of the world, most of the outside world, and these news: two states, when Israel enters the land for security.
In the short-term view, there is little hope that the stopper will at least give pressure from outside at least a little more influence on the passing of this thing.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to stop supplying weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever before to convince Hamas to accept the opinion of the Jewish state based on the 1967 border with the change of part of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
Arabs also have to press on the agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than a free tender of virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama also has his role in getting Israel to the governing table.
During his first free time, he forgot to present his own plan of peace.
Now, back in the White House, it seems to be equally attractive in its entry into the process.
It's unfortunately short-lived.
America has a vital interest in the stability of the Middle East.
This means a peaceful confrontation between Israel and Palestine.
In Australia, the laws on silhouette cigarettes were applicable
Invisible green cramps, which are the same for all signs of tobacco, are shown to protect the skin and the disease of the body.
Australia's laws on the sharp edges of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, and the logo and color of the label were replaced by the general olive green crabes with ophthalmous images of the disease of the body and the appearance of children and newborns of the disease resulting from the burning of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the cross-sections of the label, which are printed in the same small letter is required.
It's one of the most urgent regimes in the world about tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to get young people out of smoking because this crime will save their lives.
It is based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, 99% is the chance that they never start smoking.
"And in very young children, you can see that the understanding of the relationship that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says Tanya Plibersek Federal Ministry of Health and quotes studies that have shown that children are connected to the concept of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the world's lowest number of chickens and changes will have only a small impact on the profits of international companies, other countries consider taking similar steps.
The tobacco industry was very much in love with the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to lighter and more accessible cigarettes.
"With this legislation, it will lead to serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The participants from China and Indonesia will bring a lot more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, small family companies, said that the demand for cigarettes from the silicone serving to hide unsuspecting scraps, two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies lost their appeal to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and expected new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As far as possible, experts point to the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is aimed.
According to a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, monitoring of sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes in front of a direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, however, it cannot limit foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space for the promotion of your products, the online space is an unforgettable place where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the value of social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "meaning Honzo".
We need to ask ourselves, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave you work and created this video, or is it a marketing company involved?
The UK American Tobacco Australia argues that the sector is focusing on how it puts new rules rather than on marketing.
The sector began so far as it paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the attack of new regulations - countries in the framework of the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfair, even though no country from Australia is significantly commercial.
The implementation of the SOO Decision is expected in the half of 2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government is conducting talks with other governments that consider similar laws relating to defence.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photos in 2001.
More than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine, have now expanded.
The laws of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India take into account more closely.
There's a lot of chicken growing in Australia.
Pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You take out the cigarette and throw the box back," says Victor El Hage, at the purchase of the box with the photograph of the nose in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack in Sydney centre, claims that thanks to a single box, it's harder for him to match the rules.
"It took me one hour, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we would say, "OK, it's over, we'll close the window," he said and stretched his hands.
It's not so bad in the world of constant engagement
The last day of the thank you, I was unexpectedly spending five hours at the airport when our plane was having mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So we've had a lot of time to think about Christmas.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting for half a day on the airport for the next year is a nice meal, even through the distribution of books, magazines and iPhones (not only on duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development continue to come with praise.
They say we (and our children) have good times to offer.
It's a force that can go into interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And since most of us are still attached to some screens today, we have no chance to enjoy it.
So, should we support the offer?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'm going back to that.
For one thing, like many people, I've assumed that the offer is a relatively new egg that came with more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is author of the book Bored: A Living History (Historic History) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, he has a long history," he said.
A Latin inscription on the walls of Pompey was found on the walls of our first century.
And then it's also a question of how we define the nude.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After considering research literature and the presentation of the opinion of the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the smell as an example "I wanted to do something that would calm me down, but I wasn't able to do it."
The offer is determined by the fact that the person is not involved in anything but wants to be.
He says there's no need to do anything.
He says that the core of the bid is "the destruction of the attention process associated with the bad charge and the feeling of a little killing time."
Nuda can remember a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a mutual relationship, people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem themselves.
Sometimes we think that we're getting married when we're just having trouble focusing on it.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Bored in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues taught at an earlier experiment, where participants listened to the tape that a person read from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and uncomplicated TV program in the next room, others heard it so excited that they almost looked at it, while the third group did not even hear it.
Those who heard the TV program were more nervous than the other two groups - had problems with focusing, but were not sure why and did not subscribe to these problems.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, you can reduce your attention to zero, said Mark J. Fensk, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "as it's looking for the bad parts on the business line, you can ask for a song to help you not to laugh."
In fact, he said, we now know that the bending and cutting, which is often viewed as a sign of the offer, can actually help people to fight and keep physical attention.
"Studies show that children who are allowed to return will learn more and keep more information than those who need to sit quietly," said Professor Fenski.
We've all all been alive at times - late for my summer, a cheerleader, especially a long-term film.
But some individuals have a greater chance to offer themselves than others.
In the 1980s, scientists developed the "Stupids for Supplies for Supplies" (Boredom Proness Scale).
The column contains questions like, "Many things I have to do are repeated and it's monotonous," and "I have so much interest that I don't have time to do it all."
With these levels, scientists have found that boys tend to sacrifice more frequently than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, said, especially if there is a need for more and more external stimulation.
However, teenagers are generally not competitive.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment that involved about 400 teenagers and their parents about seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 per cent of the contributors indicated that they were offered at school and at home, while 23 per cent indicated that they were offered when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents indicated that they offered.
Professor Larson pointed out that he did not know whether the percentage of nude expression would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "sing is a great time for the nude", which is significantly caused by the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So return to my original question, "Is the gift good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes no, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take an absurd physical risk, play gambling games, or abuse the natural substance as a way to measure it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the link between supply and creation, said Professor Vodanov, who had studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nada is a way of telling you how to do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do here.
If you offer and use this energy to play guitar and fire, it will make you happy.
If you watch TV, however, it will only make you happy for a moment, not a long time.
So if your child offers himself and you give him an iPad, he won't offer himself anymore, but he won't learn how to just play or manage on his own, Professor Fensk said.
And "This self-control is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will learn not only how to have fun, but he will gain greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate Christmas.
But we shouldn't even be too critical for her.
Our goal should be to feel more comfortable if we are from the achievement of continuous pressure of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to offer more, but the offer is painful, unsatisfying to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people really are looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In the middle where we're still being overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to enjoy when the ball goes off."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado
Nineteenth-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at high school and a footballist from Southeast Colorado, is accused of criminal acts for something that will soon happen in the entire state of law - for holding several grams of marijuana and smoke that he used to burn.
Mr. Orozco said that one Saturday he went with a couple of friends in Lamaru, on the beach with Kansas shortly after he was stopped.
After the police found it in Marihanan's car, Mr. Orozco was asked to keep drugs and equipment for drug use - small procedures for each 100 USD trial - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the coloured vote on the legalization of the small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of fewer drug cases is more than right.
Cases of detention proceedings have already been resolved here and in Washington State, which adopted similar measures.
The police department has ceased to accuse adults at 21 years of age and older for holding a small number that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the following weeks.
But the complainants in the more conservative regions of Colorado have announced that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and continue to accuse people of being held.
At the same time, several cities from the city of Denver, heading west, vote to ban the opening of new, licensed trades with marijuana in their cities.
"This concern develops so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads of wood and regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidelines on how to set up a licensing system for packaging, production, distribution and sale - all by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or in bad, is in front of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also for recreation.
"Colorado has a better regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the licensing of the sale of alcohol in Washington State.
But as Mr Smith agreed, no place or system can do more than suggest what could work.
"There is no real precedent that we could manage," he said.
The Washington Law, i.e. I-502, holds the functions of December 6, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will be no state licensing system yet, but legal detention yes.
And there are hidden mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, such as the consideration of the State Directive on "relevant approach" to the licensed marijuana with its prohibition of trade with a cap of up to 330 metres from school, parks, children's beds or children's facilities.
"There will never be a more difficult place to place licensed trade with horses than in urban areas, especially in the Seattlu metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for Legal Horses, recently founded research groups.
On 21 November, police chief Oates from Aurora sent his officers an e-mail informing them that the city's complainant would no longer be able to prosecute the small amount of marijuana in every 21-year-old town and that the police would stop the prosecution of people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would violate the urban laws governing drug dealers of medical marijuana and that they would continue to steal drug dealers and dealers.
During the World period in northern Colorado, the county prosecutor Ken Buck presents a more accurate view.
After the vote, he announced that his office would continue to proceed in cases of detention of marijuana, mostly as a means of pressureing users to seek treatment.
At the present time, a charge of 56 grams or less is charged to 119 people, although many of them are charged with another charge.
"Our authority is obliged to bring down a criminal charge that was criminal at the time of his arrival," Mr. Buck pointed out in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places, such as the external period of Mass, where the volunteers stopped the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period, no longer accuses adults of holding a small number.
The interim prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to stop all ongoing cases of detention.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing in law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the Coloured Volunteers supported the measure, the introduction of recreational marijuana into government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the counter-attached reactions to the state revealed, in view of this great state-wide green experiment, a deep dispersion between local officials.
For the procurator, it's a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is responsible for the detention of marijuana, and local speakers of the National Organization for the reform of the laws relating to marijuana.
"They've done so much of their lives by moving people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to which the small number of marijuana are placed as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become the national testing cases for drug law enforcement.
The prosecutors and the state authorities plan new restrictions on legalised sales and at the same time eagerly await instructions from the federal government, who is still planning to consider the sale and prosecution of convicted of federal crimes.
Law enforcement advocates are confident that the Ministry of Justice is in favour.
In addition to several arrests of marijuana dealers for medical purposes and patients who took care of it, the majority of the federal government left trades with marijuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 countries in operation.
While anti-drug agents will probably not open the door to capture a small drug mix, it is likely that they will open up the opportunity for the state of regulated trade with the recreational marijuana approved new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser to the anti-drug policy of President Obama.
Several colored cities don't wait for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new marijuana trade, even though it will take about a year before the power of any trade will be opened.
Last week Montrose proposed a semi-annual ban on the west of the state and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to get caught up in the situation when we give someone a license and then we'll have a big federal case," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our people voted against this addendum.
We're looking at what the village voted for, and we're sorry for what the state voted out.
There's really a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was brought to the exit of Oxford because I'm a conservative."
In their opinion, only today's university students are attacked.
I don't remember ever going to school at Oxford University.
As my father, my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest scientific community, a modern Greek symposium that motivated two pilots of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And while I was at the end of the 80th century, two weeks after I went to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, cut the covers, and I got back to my first life scandal.
My father broke up and cried.
My friends were suspicious.
The Daily Evening Standard claimed that I gave it up because I had intentions against the love of the students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson publicly declared that I was leaving because I was forced to drink from broken bands.
I mean, it was less comical.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic schizophrenia and fear.
Not because of my weird name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was followed by a single reason, and in this cycle of thought enlightenment, it was as big as barbaric as it was: my father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly established consultant, Margaret Thatcher, and I was a Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm making it up to now.
It is simply because the latest reports indicate that the new generation of students is suffering from a similar survey from the middle.
The institutionalized and growing hatred against conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students won the same protection of equal rights as gays, health professionals and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Youth Youth Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views they are often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and have been exposed to the fact that they are not victims.
They call for the creation of a position in the University Committee for equal opportunities to ensure that their views can be communicated freely.
Their situation did not even help the recently mentioned BBC TV series Two with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Pohadka country: young, intelligent and legal) about student political actions that the conservators seemed to be partial and inconsistency.
In the series was presented by an absolute Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (conservative Association of Oxford University - OUCA), who carried Rolls-Royc, was dressed in bright clothing and had a hair with a gray head.
In other high schools, conservative students say that they have been treated as "sacrifices".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Nottingham University), said to non-partners that "Levial influence on universities grows.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
One-hundred-year-old historian at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the noise for greater protection, says that such a climate is "failure", while nine-year-old elected president OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that access to JCR members has resulted in an increase in the number of people from the middle.
"This represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of the members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was less than a member.
I grew up in September 1986, 18 years, and in a protective way.
The hatred for the Conservative Page was the worst.
A year ago, the university voted to refuse the award of a prestigious title by former student Margaret Thatcher, for reasons of failure to finance higher education.
From the atmosphere, there would be a steady stream of concerns.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students met each other and with the professors, I was able to enjoy the bird he was supposed to come.
I've found out not only the teachers of milk approve the preservation of condoms, but it also makes sense to him.
The policy of Horoniki, privatization and opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in the Republic of South Africa was brought to the attention of the officials.
My first presentation was about the translation of the 18th century French text into English and what followed, I was not prepared.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "Please replace the first paragraph."
I've had enough of that.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a dog's neck, was very rude.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were hygienic.
I'm looking at my eyes with tears.
"I propose that you take some basic lesson in French in your free time, so if you are not too busy with social affairs," said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room with a smile.
At night at school, I sat by myself when I felt a slight fall on my shoulder.
He was a student of the second anniversary of James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," said suddenly.
I'm sorry.
Anyone who suspects conservatism is the target.
It's too bad for me, but your father knows he's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most of the condoms suggest they're workers.
Later in the local home, I tried to pretend.
I kept myself from agreeing with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved to be a failure.
A first-year-old student in the field of philosophy, politics and economy, who (like irony) went to Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist poet."
You're pregnant.
The other students made contact with him.
I was brought back, dirty.
"How do conservators love each other?" asked one.
It's sweet, isn't it?
I felt like they had to feel gay before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever take a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have to deal with people just after the meeting?
Should I switch to the lab and get my natural clothes?
Three years ago, I was raised as a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who sat at my college, was the only conservative professor.
He was hated not only because he's conservative but also because he's a consultant, Margaret Thatcher, for foreign policy and one of those who write words to her.
He wasn't almost there.
He hated this place for his province and his smallness and for his example to the Marxist-Deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he attended a lecture at the University of Bilkents in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started going from Oxford to the home of my parents in London, looking for an attack on my busy metropolis friends and family.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his four-year study at Oxford, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His blind eyes were smiling.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
I was cut off by a number of trips to London, and my silence had deteriorated.
My friend, also the Conservative Party, dropped the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the study, when another professor of history publicly declared that I was a "enemy of people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was in the middle of a red school, I admitted that my parents broke my brain and I called it "old crazy."
The scene was just a short time ago.
My father called my father on my oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two letters every week to Murdoch's newspapers.
My door was closed.
I got baptized inside, and after five minutes my pursuers took it away.
When they left, I took my suitcase and got the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a fucking weak one.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational institution of such fear and greed.
Even more tragic, though, is that it was Oxford, from which not only took 14 conservative primers, but also conceals themselves today as an undeserved history of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has more elegance than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Naty Abascalov, Fiono Thyssen-Bornemiss and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, an old residence of Isabely I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentina Garavani's exhibition.
The rapporteur confirmed this at the beginning of the famous retrospective "Valentino: master fashion design", which represents more than 130 models of high-quality methods created by his workshop over the last 50 years.
"I worship this castle," he says with his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il Signor" Garavani is the only protagonist that could not be written without his valued clients.
Valentino has always felt overwhelmed by the strange and distant world of aristocratism.
The first volume of exhibitions, which runs until March 3rd, is a private correspondence and photography with the signatures of the most prominent slechtics, from Princess Salimy Aga Khan via the Greek Princess Marii-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as a trophies of his social appearance: from a simple cross from Voghera city in northern Italy to an image of the international "bohemic mural".
Having a royal family is not bad.
"They at least don't touch you a cup of cigarettes into a great cup, as some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiss.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in Alpach and were good friends.
Valentino is a typical guest and guests are having a nice and elegant taste.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close friends of the forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelio or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always had more elegance than glory.
And yet there is a star from it."
Valeria Mazzová presents Valentina
The designer's charisma doesn't even mention the Argentina model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we've been visiting Piazza di Spagna in Rome for one night.
We were 20 and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every small part of his apartment, entertainment, food, music, and everything he felt and felt his spirit.
All calls could make him feel important and loving," recalls the top model that started working with him during the Paris Week High Mode in 1995.
"Never comes out of fashion, because his suggestions are artistic works," he concludes.
A review of the urgency
A saved life is not a story of inheritance, it is not really a repetitious love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House's gallery was stopped at a personal 70-metre-long pass that offers a change of role: the visitor changes to the model and comes to the passport to observe the "obscenity" of the dreams that Valentinov's mysterious work on it as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that she had in her own Monica Vitti's "night" or a cup of wool and goat that belonged to Caesar Farah Dibaov.
In the public, the manuscript is named Sibilla Lucemburg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulharská or Sophie Habsburská.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "not to forget about it."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were calhots, shirts, gillettes and sac from the 1971-1972 underground collection.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the propellers.
"I give him the other advantage for his feminity and great love for women, because it sustains our beauty," adds an ex-priviator from Feria.
"I love the colors that he uses, that make a lot of sense and give "juskrum" faces.
The proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget how Valentina dressed first.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she tried to be full of clothes and have an opportunity to wear one of her dinner watches...
It was finally expected at the end of the 90th century.
"I bought my first dress from Valentina for the occasion of celebration at the town of my cousin, Princess Edouarda de Ligne.
These were red clothes that were to be cut off by the bells, the raised animal and the floor without the shoulder.
It was a dream that became reality," says the widow after Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is a laxic to fashion, his hair is overtime," explains an Italian aristocratic, whose life varies between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a set of designer wedding dress "very tight... because the dress is not just dress, it's also a memory file that they have in them."
King mode
The golden grave of exhibits in Somerset House are the wedding dress of Marie-Cantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greck in 1995.
In the creation of these silver-coloured sloven-coloured clocks with all the pearls, twelve types of different terrain and train lengths four and a half meters were needed for four months of work and 25 "colek" (as the propeller calls his candles).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authorities of the specialized press, these sets represent high-level ways at the end of the 20th century, "to turn customers from high-ranking companies".
Valentino is now the best example of his elite "savare-estre" during the summer.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and a well-known series of common legends gathers as many poets as any of his client's wives.
"My attention has always attracted his choice, calm, adjusted and perfect view," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner in the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, my big friend.
He was innocent, he left no time for it."
When she says that princess...
The world's toughest move: wearers in the Kawah Ijen Company
In four euros, the Indian syllables are captivated by their life and health when they weigh 70 pounds [70 kg] of silhouettes below the steep stone walls.
They're people whose work is burnt, and they're the ones who actually work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 climbers who learn to live by getting cheese from Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, every day it must reach the bottom of the crater, where it avoids acid rain from inside the earth, and when it is in contact with the air, it passes into a strong condition.
After a large block of cheese that weighs up to 70 kilos, it is taken to the shoulder in two bambosus bones after a few stone steps.
At the top of the tower, which is 2,386 meters, it is just 250 meters, but the worn-out boots last more than 40 minutes than they are exposed to the cold temperatures above, because they maintain balance and basically expand their steps so that they do not break up and fall into destruction.
He knows that any inconvenience could be a life like that of a French tourist who came out of Kawah Ijen a year ago.
Kawah Ijen is making five cents per kilogram of cheese that weighs
When they're up, they cross the road by tourists who photograph it, like they're in the circus, and they're quick to take heavy hair to the bag that the bottom of the company has put something down in the sea height of 1850 meters.
It is about PT Candi Grymbi, which has been a heavy company since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rubies (five cents) per kilogram of cheese.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rubies (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this growth has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of tobacco, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar whites.
"Because it usually carries 70 kilos, we make about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) per trip," explains Anton, who usually completes three roads a day.
One trip takes him three hours and he's finally gone, but he can make 138 000 rubies (11.5 euros) per day.
Even though it's considered an indispensable part of such a neil effort, it's a third of what he's gonna do on the field.
"The daily wage of the hillers is very high here. For example, for the collection of coffee, 15 000 rupees (1,2 euros) are paid per day and 2 million rupees (167 euros) are paid per day," explains a guide who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a wall.
There he paid 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and work was not so hard, but Anton returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the village, for a serious reason that is as convincing as a sister in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's breathing badly, he's always breathing, and his eyes are affected by toxic fluids
In his 27-year-old, Anon takes three times a day to risk his life in Kawah Ijen, whose cheese has already begun to choose his taxes, although he has a face protected from special masks and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's got a bad breath, he's always breathing, and his eyes have toxic fluids that escape from the soybeans.
It's the price he has to pay for getting his dream.
"I will work for another two years, because I want to open the trade or study Spanish or French," he promises more than an existing English.
This sympathic and intelligent young man brought to court could be a tourist guide, a reader or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does a work of the wearer.
She shares a spinal wooden hat with other wearers and rises every day in two hours in the morning, because the cheese does not stop growing in the night and its characteristic yellow color changes in the blue and dark.
And over the surrounding darkness, Anton goes to the crater and lights up the road with a little light that he has added to his helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 bearings hang on the edge of the hair with cheese from the bottom of the crater.
Although the company has high income, the weight of the cheese due to cost savings has not been reduced, nor does it provide carriers working on their own income and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from the photographing facility, which together with the attendance of 15 000 rupees (1,2 euros) select the natural park viewers from tourists who come to photograph the suction and its human remains.
"This work is for life, not for people," says Madrusin, a state-owned 42-year-old wearer who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can take up to 110 pounds and ensures that he keeps working, "as far as it goes", because he needs money to teach his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to bed, I'm going to die here because the husband was my whole life.
Even though the sire burns the throat and lips in the eyes when the wind suddenly turns around and the tops up in the thick shelves that come out of the pockets are so strong that none of them complains that they are suffering from serious disabilities... it is obviously from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee disease, and wounds caused by your bones.
The unainik, who weighs his tail on the back, can weigh only 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Each day, he and his colleagues release 15 tons of cheese, and then three trucks take the narrow road between the woods to the roof of Tamarsari, 18 miles away.
"I won't go to bed, I'll die here because the husband was my whole life," Uainik announces and opens up the wide mouth in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, he's the oldest, thirty-three-year-old, he's also doing the rape.
Time is running, but the constant existence of one of the world's most difficult puzzles remains from generation to generation - puzzles that run human balls in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore sells a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans argue that they don't have children, on careers, stress and cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm the owner, you're my wife and you're the owner.
It may seem unbelievable that this complex part of the advertising on mentole bonbon, but still - or maybe that's why - video from the beginning of this year in Singapore has massively expanded on YouTube.
These clouds are part of a rapa that uses local flags of the "dum box to dust" type as the highest fertility rates in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, who created the video, hopes that this advertising will be able to alert them in an attractive way.
The artistic director of the agency Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to fulfill his "public duty."
"It's a great deal about the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had to feel that it's the subject we have to touch.
We know that the government has tried a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing a list of dinners.
Many of these ideas may be quite complex, but not entirely functional.
So we've been thinking why not do the most creative thing here, like making a rap to solve this problem."
1,2 children
The one who takes it very seriously on a light load is the Singapore government.
Each year, they spend $1,300 on raising citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for the child, grants a mother’s permission and grants a financial contribution.
All these measures, however, had a small impact.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservatives of its representatives and strict social controls.
The rate of birth in Singapore with regard to population breakdown is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The latter exceeded the birth rate of value 2, which was considered to be re-peace, in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Mingo, director of the Committee on Marriage and Family of the National Population Authority, says it's due to "better education" and "larger career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of opportunities, with regard to the goals and priorities of life, is not just wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in Community standards have contributed to the increase in the number of free people and to the disappearance of marriage and childbirth. As a result, the decline in fertility rates in Singapore has been seen.
While there was a drastic effort in the framework of immigration policies to increase the size of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of citizens, this resulted in a lack of independence among local citizens.
On some Singapore websites, it is seen an unsolicited xenophobic against many new visitors, especially the Chinese, who are critical of maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why the government of Singapore has recorded its worst voluntary outcome since the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, there was a problem of trying to solve using quotas and higher payments for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, certain unexpected consequences have also been achieved in Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence trade with property.
The City Development Authority has begun to regulate the number of small houses known as "bots" that can be established in certain urban areas.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have great success in selling.
However, he fears that these bees can support young life-styles and influence developers to build large families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of El Developers, claims that their "bots" are sold far faster than bigger houses.
"They are more popular, and so they sell from day to week faster than houses with more space.
That's why the money flow is much better for us."
However, the new standards set out more clearly for developers who were previously confined to offer too many small houses in one project.
Addition
Singapore is a city state.
Although this new rules could lead to an increase in population fertility, the discussion with Singapore workers in the financial quarter in the city centre indicates that they will not have a major impact.
"People are still in stress, homes are expensive, just like education, so many people refuse," said the young official.
"The rest of them have children.
But it's important for me to focus on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women drop out of their career, stress and cost of living and education as reasons to protect them from having children.
So if the government is trying to force citizens to have children, it is the same end of Singapores who have the last word for the family.
What is private offline is private and online
Soukromi.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, there is something that has a personal attitude or "the power of private life which has every right to protect against any violation".
What's private for a 16-year-old man?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and on social networks?
Do I understand the danger that is presented when it publishes information on the Internet that would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Newspapers from ElPeriodico spoke to five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age, who have been a respected Internet user.
In four cases, they considered the concept of private "all of its own" in a personal level and as "user name and password" if it was about a social network.
"I wouldn't reveal my greatest secret," said 10-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy at places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They are very secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I give the FB nice photos or pictures as we play.
I'll talk to the famous people there too.
I wouldn't share a photo that wouldn't be mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscenity photographs, photographs of the naked person or photographs of the crimes, or to write down degrading or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all the 35 friends he's got on the FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are neighbors.
There's a mother with the name and the password of one of the accounts.
"I have put an account on Twitter so that I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just giving them that," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to neighbors who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to a stranger.
The case of fourteen-year-old José is different.
This tenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and in the last mentioned network that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of that, because we have something common, for example, music," she says.
According to this boy, none of them hated him for anything, nor did he want a address or a phone number.
"If they're looking at me or asking me for it, they're just removing it from their account," he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading his Twitter recommendation.
These guys are not unique experiences with what is called cyberbulling today.
"A well-known friend on the social network was fired.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never found out who it was," he says.
According to José, the victim didn't issue an account.
"You've only activated your private mode."
Then it explains the series of steps, how to count safely.
Unlike George, this boy would have confirmed the photos known in unpleasant or tragic situations.
"Of course, I would do that if someone guided me or just wanted me.
Even if I know it's cyberbulling," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of the Education and Education Division, has to understand that the main purpose of these networks is to provide information to children and adolescents in social networks.
It states that "the Internet has become a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game have changed."
Marrios Porrasov notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a graduate professor at Yale University and author of the article Digital Homer and Digital Traveller, introduced these ideas to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital mothers are children and young people who were born in the time of this technology.
We're digital passengers who have to learn them, and then we're learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that it is a complex theme, "because we ask them to know what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, in the age at which they are not grown up."
Also, to be - as to the environment - disgusting, in a time when the most challenging thing is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adults what is private is to ask questions that are needed to think about.
"Tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Dále Marrios Porrassa mentions some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to publish your photo like you did to a friend?
You know what others say about you?
When you're marking the people on the photos of the show, did you ask them for permission?
And one more: Everyone still needs to know what you're doing?
The next point is to find out that they have to behave in the Internet as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
"A person is governed by respect, moral and other principles outside the Internet and should be on social networks," he says.
View
Esturado Guardia, a university professor, teacher at the first level and educator explains that it is necessary for parents to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If they understand each loyalty, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences that the online account can have.
For example, concerning age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is key to remind children of the traditional rule of "not talking to strangers".
Summaries of South America's end and Lim's Declaration was not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Peru today ends without the publication of the Declaration from Lima, which was announced and which was officially signed by seven present presidents.
The Efe Agency repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Presidential Offices, who initially decided that the document would be published after the end of the summit, indicated that it would be published later on the Peruvian Government websites.
They further indicated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanto Humalou in several short press releases.
The journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, video from the presidential meeting without a voice was transmitted to the press room with a message of "confidential sitting, sound transmission".
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were attending, however, never by the Peruvian language.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participants with the presidents, which did not allow hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidential Office sent an e-mail with "a final statement" from the summit, but only about the statement of President Humali, not the official document that the summit closed.
The last round of Peru hosted the third summaries of the South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Paises Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the Declaration from Lima was not originally published, although it was strictly demanding.
On the official ASPA pages, it can be found that the document was published yesterday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities were required to ensure that all journalists were sent, but were totally limited in access to information.
The summit concluded with another joint commitment by Chile and Peru to take action by the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the dispute on the border between the two countries.
President Peru Olanta Humala and President Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decisions of the International Court of Justice in Haagu, which, on Monday, will begin to hear the exaggerate statements of the two sides of the dispute initiated by Lima against Santiago.
"We will defend ourselves and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are conducting today in this international court," said President Humala with his Chilean interpreter.
"Chile was, it was and will be a country in respect of international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added and congratulated President Humalu with a strong hand in the train of both countries.
Both of the Presidents confirmed that the decision of the International Court of Justice was made after Colombia adopted the Bogotsk Pact this week, which expressed the interpretation of the judgments of the International Court of sea borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely incorrect.
The summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Roseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the call of the current President, Fernando Luga, and the meeting was not attended.
The hotel president Olanta Humala was entrusted with the commencement of the morning talks and the completion of the summit in Lima shortly after Sunday.
The President read a final document stating that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects between South American countries had been planned with investments of 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the agreements adopted, UNASUR's member countries will take "the important steps leading to the goals of the South American population for which the housing agreements have been extended".
He reported that actions have been promoted to improve "citizen security cooperation and international organised crime, to improve access to medicines and cheap internet in all South America's markets, and to joint and effective measures against natural disasters".
When Europe is in the crisis, "there is no economic consolidation (Latin America) a victory basis, it must certainly serve to expand our productivity and show our people a better future," Humal added.
"We have decided to preside over a group of 31 symbolic projects that improve transport connections between the various parts of South America, in particular the foreign and foreign areas... in order to improve our countries and create new economic ties," said the Peruvian president in a reading.
He mentioned that five of these projects were related to Peru and the historical islands of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two others were related to a better relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its return to the Union of South American nations," from which it is currently released.
Another concern that the summit had developed was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is Celestial and has a good neighbourly relationship.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said in advance of his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan successor Daniel Ortego on Saturday in Mexico in order to proceed with respect to the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the dispute on the sea border that is suspected of Bogotou.
"It is possible to meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We order all the solutions, none of them are excluded, nor the Treaty with Nicaragua, which would require a union with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to say to the President of Ortegeg that we will lead the most civilized and most carefully possible form," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to take part in the opening of President Enrique Peñi Nieti.
Within the framework of the summit, the Union Defence Ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which reinforces dialogue and consensus on defence issues.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country mentioned is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary president of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of a common society is a goal in which South America, in this case, must learn from Europe.
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the United States of America (Unasur) in Lima, announced on state TV Peru that the Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but are now practically one state".
In this regard, the project of creating a South American population supported by the Unasur Member State.
"There must be a free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already in the midst of the Andean community, yet there are still back-up areas that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he would agree with the recapture of the Organization of America (OAS) under the condition that it would reduce the impact of the Anglo-Saxon States and take action against those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
"Those who are in the head are never bound to anything, and we the South American are signing everything.
It is understandable that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has been funded in Washington by the United States," stated the complainant for political asylum provided by Equator WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that this decision did not matter because he did not violate his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to third countries without regard to the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised the Swedish court, which asked him to submit a hearing on the Swedish territory for a particular sexual crime, while "the Swedish own legislation allows for the hearings to be conducted by a video conference talk which could be carried out by an Ecuadorian referendum in London".
Correa indicated that there is a risk that Assange will be affected by physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him for a while, what's on our anniversary, but I've been very excited to know that he's got little trouble, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But he fears that his physical and mental condition will worsen, because he is closed to a small space without the possibility of moving to a clean air.
This would mean everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the settlement of Assange's asylum from June to the Ecuadorian Republic of London on the basis of a permit to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, and emphasized that the discussions were held with London to resolve the detention of WikiLeaks.
"We do not act on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have always been discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, because Assange's Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings at various European institutions," he said.
He said, "If the Great Britain leaves tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Swedish Mr. Assange listens to an Ecuadorian report in London or via Skype, how it enables the dark legislation and how it has been implemented in other cases, it will be done tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a freer of pressure and explained that he strongly did not tolerate "the hypocrisy, wrong thoughts and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
We are not the biggest enemies of the free press, political parties, even bad journalists in profit, oppression and exploitation," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "no bankers, neither hegemon countries nor bourgeoisie, do not govern Ecuador", and he said that if he is again elected, "he will continue in the changes made in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the opinion expressed by Paraguay regarding the membership of the Union of Unasur at least in its next elections and argued that the aim "must be strong and not tolerate opportunism and punitiveism based on legality", because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian president stated that he considered "all-appropriate" the invitation of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the trial of the International Court of Justice in Haagu, which decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's about the problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but needs to be overcome by a desire to run together.
It is necessary to judge them to be convinced and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed the hope of resolving the maritime border dispute that was resolved by the Peruvian and Chile Court of Justice, and expressed the view that "it is proper for Latin America to seek an international court if both countries are committed to adopting a judgment to be as hard as possible."
With regard to the possibility of candidateing in future presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in the order of the third term, he noted that he considered this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa announced that if the election expires in August 2013, it will leave the public life.
"I have never been very interested in myself, but the unjust situation, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be managed by political power.
My political reputation believed that I was the one who promises this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I were to win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we win, she's waiting for me.
I've decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health care treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Cháveze in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Madurem, who says that President Chavez went to planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It's not about a relapse in the president's health status," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today participated in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the South American Peoples (Unasur), which was completed with the challenges of increasing regional integration for the purpose of maintaining development, equity and security.
Victims of AIDS are today due to post-diagnoses
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test results were confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like a blow to me," she reported at the moments of truth, which the doctor tried to "fuck up a bit," but obviously without success.
The guy's in front of the family chair.
He decided to take his disease alone on his own and started to inform her about it, and with such surprise that he had already celebrated 43th birthday.
It is certainly one of the most recent HIV units in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajár (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battle with disabilities.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which has been something invisible from the beginning of the 1990s when there were a lot of doubts, little possibilities for treatment and more progress.
At the time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) did not listen to him, "because he had a bad morning".
At that time, AIDS was a sonic death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disability and arrive when the virus has caused an organ infection and has sent out the immune system and then become victims of appropriate infections.
31 years since the outbreak of AIDS in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "it means great success that the patient’s life span, which begins in time and in an appropriate manner, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, leading HIV Unit in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, with the fact that this information was confirmed in the autumn of the year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and specialist on HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a cause of death, but that the duration of survival and adequate life depends on the extent to which the immune system is diagnosed, while those who do not use drugs are better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply stated, the person who has been diagnosed with HIV for 25 years may, according to these terms, "be able to live without problems for up to 75 years," explained in a doctor’s discussion.
To highlight this progress, it is appropriate to note that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years today.
Although deaths in recent years have decreased significantly and in Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS) is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011 and in the summer of the year, 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
Why do people still die from the effects of disability?
- "I don't think the problem is in access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not missed the supply of medicines. The problem is that patients are coming in very advanced stages, because they do not know the condition of the seizures, or in the late stages of disability."
He adds: " Nine out of ten patients are coming when there is a combined infection. The only thing we need to do in order to influence the whole death is first diagnosed disease, and therefore, in a large measure, we need to offer tests to ensure the inability of all those who ask for it."
In its proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco state and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who had come to undergo tests to a private laboratory only because he did this to his friend, and through his minor age, he had already suffered from AIDS and also had to suffer from Capiso sarcoma, a rare disease that is one of the most common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're dying, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for better, for better, for them, for flowers, for taking medicines."
Today his parents know only that he was suffering from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead active sexual life, but I pay attention to myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge to share his experience with Aunt MILLENIO JALISCO, to motivate his witness today in the face of World AIDS.
"Let's let them do tests. If they're risking, let's know first if they're positive, and if they're already diagnosed, let's know they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This report contains the title of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms for powder
Among the health and general population programmes is a great loss, Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who provides information on HIV virus.
And the biggest mercenaries are in danger.
In places that are believed to be responsible for this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before we were given one or two, today they give us bottles and these condoms, which are very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the quickest to the new orders, they're overwhelming.
"What do you want?" is the usual question of full irony and consideration from social workers, school counselors, medical staff and healthcare staff who want to avoid, says the reporter.
He suggested that this ineffective distribution change, so that the condoms are not just for pulses, but that they are located in dosings in public bathrooms, in places where young people often walk.
"It's not promiscuity support.
It's not even "pay them beer and motel," as Governor Emilio González answered the question whether he would agree to divide the conservators in his period.
It's best to access the condoms of those who already lead sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco State
13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) were reported.
This is the fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13 places in relation to HIV.
92% of the order runs a sexual route, 6% of the bloodway and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, since in one recorded case there are four to five people who do not know about disability.
The judgment approved by the Court of Appeal of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the Group of Vitro’s company’s competition in Mexico, constitutes an inequitable precedent for any national business with its neighbours in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It appears, therefore, that the restructuring procedures for the company which enables Mexican laws, in the country of origin and the stars, in spite of international agreements, do not pay.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year, Judge Harlin Halem, in the competition court for northern Texas, leaves Mexican companies in practice without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river El Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican producer's door to the Supreme Court of the United States with a call for three differences.
In the introduction, it should be said that while the judge of this case claims that the creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the appeal court of the fifth period claims to sit in New Orleans that the main procedure is the competition procedure in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of international enterprises.
For this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was established for the purpose of harmonising international trade law, which is appointed by the arbitration body of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of the district of the internal business structure, when it is recognised that the duties of the parent company Vitro against the districts would not be met by the required majority for the restructuring approval.
However, this possibility is guaranteed by the Mexican law.
In fact, the case of Vitro was not the first to accept this scheme.
There are half of these examples, such as Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Competition Institute has managed its internal debt.
In addition, it is true that even after the vote of the side, the creditors - who stood against Vitro's company in the U.S. courts, i.e. "groups", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not get the majority.
The vote would reach approximately 45 per cent by 37.
This statement is not taken by a court of appeal.
From another point of view, the Vitro court is responsible for the difficult situation that has taken place since 2008 - behind the serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, Gonzalez Sady’s family company calls for a new assessment directly to the appeal court to make the assessment complete, thus to the participation of five judges, because they initially voted only three.
If he fails here, he will be required as the correct means of revision of the process by a higher authority, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In this case, it is important that the court mentioned the document sent to the Mexican government as an attack by Amius Curiae, in which the procedure described by Vitro within the framework of the Competition Act is described and shows that the company has facilitated its accession to the agreements signed by the two countries in order to counter that law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
It also shows that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, which is the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for creditors and creditors.
Look at both sides: punishment for Vitro and state society.
Total valuation
Without prejudice, several months of notification by the Mexican Air Force Committee against former owners of Gaston Azcarraga Andradem, who had been called out of the double course, and according to the team of pilots, has already passed away.
The Authority in charge of Carlos Díaz Chávez Moreneaue directly appealed to the National Banking Commission and to the Commission for Value Papers, which is accused of an obstacle to achieving justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction carried out by the undertaking, where the company’s name was chosen by the company F/589 from the IXE bank.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of the share of the Professional Department of Hotels (Administrator Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Azkarrag Andrade is a major shareholders of the Posadas hotels.
The relief of Dragon Martu
In the area of Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens who accepted the creation of an association were gathered on the weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as we know, about a large commercial and distribution centre with products from "a country with a big wall" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include the living area of 150 companies in the lower part.
The Canacintra (Camara National de la Industria de Transformación) has already been able to unite the leaders of the Southern Zone to stand against the monumental area, which would, in part, undermine the protected area and represent the root cause of all industrial resistance.
End of proceedings with the ACTA document
The request for a Senate which the Government did not take in a passport and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Prosecutor signed in Japan the Trade Agreement against Coding, known as the ACTA brief, was rejected by the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicoo de la Propiyad Industrial).
As we know, it happened despite the fact that the dream itself created an opportunity to consider it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was sleeping with this solo sport for over 60 years and was processing thanks to him all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have so many memories of the history of local basketball, such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he died in 2008 on a bicycle race, burned to this sport over 60 years ago, to be a player of the youth categories, a national basketball league BSN player, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or the president of the Puerto Rican basketball Federation.
"I have had a lot of role in my life in basketball, including a few at the same time as when I was President of the National League of BSN in the '90s, the general leader of the national team and president of the federation," Reyes reminded reporters of Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamon, where he has been with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes's in his claim of non-refoulement.
The walls of his house, which are almost all photographed and monumental objects from his long career, testify to it.
Bayamón in hearts
With the greatest enthusiasm of all the races, those who remember his performance in Los Vaqueros from the mid 50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as a co-rapporteur or team owner.
"It was my best summer, which I enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity with a team of Los Vaqueros since 1967 to participate in eight missions, whether as a master, a partner, or a coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I broke up with one champion -- in 1981, when Jerome Mincy started in the BSN.
At that time, the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a big two-foot player for you.
You want him?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended to me the player Raymond Gaussey, who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon victory to the champion, Gausse will contribute to the next."
The champion, when he played the Vaqueros Gausse team, was pleased, but he's just gone too far because in 1988 he had already performed the function of the president of the basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to be fully committed to his function and to enjoy Mincy's place in the national team.
"I remember our first defeat in the United States in the qualifying Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world's mysteries in 1990, where we ended fourth, but we had to have a bronze not to be the Canadian decision that allowed us to repeat our final arrest," Reyes said.
Is the man from the world's mercy in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who hit the Dream Team on the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in the Spanish games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we fired the United States men, who were quite like the one that fired a gun to the world's mysteries.
This man had not only Mincy, Gausseo, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers of León (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of the injuries of the knee.
A man who may not have a perfect composition, but who showed us to win gold medals and bring great joy, was a man with Olympic qualifications in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on the record, such as "Canito" Nijeves, Pablo Alice and Junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who rewarded players for their performances in the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we have won gold in spite of all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was no mistake of Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are decisive.
No one in Portorica had achieved this level of results such as Piculin.
He's not talking about his behavior in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation belonging to Julius Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arilla from my young age.
Which success in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of national men in the years 1988 to 1995 and that the national league of BSN was held in one season to 17 men from the early 1990s.
What did you not prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, such as the distribution of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other islands only in national games-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too much games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits of compulsory certificates and courses for trainees, decision-makers and decision-makers.
I'm glad.
What do you owe me now?
I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I enjoy the night and I often go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always on my side.
He died here, Larry Hagman.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, announced the world's major role of John Rose Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, where he was killed by a man who ate indiscriminately and was seductive and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of J.R. Einga's play in the Dallas television series became a symbol of lacytics in the 1980s, died.
It was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official notification of the family, which the Associated Press agency provided to Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon on the basis of the cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role that he had the worst," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on the day of thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in a remote hospital," reported her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, great, fun, nice, sweet and talented and he'll be very much after me.
He was unique and lived his life in full," Linda Gray announced.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver surgery in 1992 and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot of alcohol for years.
In 1995, he was found in the irons of the cavern and Hagman was subjected to transplantation.
Years before the Dallas series was released, Hagman celebrated on television as a listening guy in a relaxed comedy I Dream of Jeannie sent to NBC stations from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the position of Captain Tony Nelson, whose life changes when he hits an attractive girl (genna), who plays Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedians who were sent only briefly, and to The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film performance included the role that was well-accepted by the critics: The Group, Harry and Toto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's master's performance was like an incredible repugnant J.R., which led him to the star peak.
A dramatic series of CBS stations on the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was sent from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jakara?", which was supposed to create expectations about the role of full emotion when Hangman's situation was almost killed, caused not only a huge number of speculations around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in tax offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in monitoring.
The October 1980 part, in which the answer was revealed, was followed by 41 million TV shows. Dallas became the second most popular series of history after the release of the MASH series in 1983, which followed 50 million TV shows.
On J.R., he shot his swagger Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened to sign her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack her.
Hagman played Ewinga, an unsatisfied champ with a charismatic smile: a lstivian businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, into treatment.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the wall," said Hagman in 1988.
It's supposed to be, "Here's the honor of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't happen to him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled on Friday at Hagman as someone who was "great on the beach and beyond."
It is unforgettable and unforgettable for millions of fans in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were to know and love it.
Ten parts of Dallas' new series sent TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second row have already been completed and the sixth has just arrived," the television station reported.
There was no announcements from Warner's company or from the TNT station about how to proceed.
The father of Fort Worth in Texas was the son of the hero and singer Mary Martin, who grew up in classical fields, such as South Pacific music and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when, in 1931, Larry’s father, lawyer Ben Hagman, was born.
From the early 1950 ’ s, Larry experienced the happiness of the circuits in New York, and then in 1952 to 1956 he served in England at the airport.
There he met a young Swedish counselor, Maj Axelson, who married him.
A couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time they lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrites live.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tal (and Absolute Truth) Tales about My Life.
"I haven't been there for anything I knew would hurt someone or hurt him," said the Press Associate agent.
After liver transplantation, he began to pay for organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped battle patients.
"I'm working with them, I'm giving them a lift, I'm dating them when they're going to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a break in the sense "Don't worry, it'll be a little unpleasant, but you'll be healthy."
He was also active in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that explores "the end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Professor Stuart Charmé of Religion decided that this seminar would make a course about the end of the world, he knew it was an endless curse: the end of the "long number" of May's calendar, which will come on December 21, came to a large number of people as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what he was waiting for in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the calculated destruction that some call the "long Armageddon", and the growing conflict in which Israel is trapped, the place in which Christians theorize about the end of the world begin Revelation.
"I didn't realize this would be the most exciting semester he'd ever be," said Charme this week to the students of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When a person discovers what's going on in the world today, like if we had 30 days, it's really a good time.
And remember, it's a bad sign for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only teacher who's offering courses about "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in the days.
At the University of Temple, a professional assistant, Barry Vacker, organized the course "Minds, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We're going to figure out why these ideas are expanding with time," she says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
If, for example, nuclear material is delivered into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic subjects and examine how they look at real life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, reliable and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the National University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solario, a professional assistant to art and anthropology to organize a course with a simple name of the end of the world.
"We don't agree "2012," because we always count on the opportunity to re-establish the course if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
And through the "dangerous trap" students must study, create projects and make final tests.
At Penn State will be a final test at the end of the night of the Apocalypse, which does not give students the opportunity to work "as soon as the expected end of the world is at night," said Restall.
The dogs have become quite popular.
"He broke up in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high average of 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received an e-mail asking if it was still a place.
Personal students make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to make themselves happy," said Bridgid Robinson, a student in the field of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutger University in Camden, 23.
And then apocalyptic, worldly or religious thinking is just a matter of escape or absence.
Will Weekesa, a 25-year-old sociology and healing student, said he saw all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be studied," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But none of the said students, and then professor, said he didn't believe in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project announced the Mayan Prediction, and we will certainly destroy it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple from West Chester.
"Mayo's never preached the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that in Western culture there is a apocalyptic disorder that takes several centuries back, which people react to changing their environment by warning of the end of the world.
The development of these speculations has caused the Internet.
"People don't think about it," he said.
That's what happens in most English speaking worlds.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who spends the year in the Philippines, asked if he knew about a course on "the end of the world", answered quickly.
"Philippines are not involved at the end of the world," he wrote and pointed out an exception to the highest authority.
We have mercy from Papeje.
Restall noted that during the last few days of the court, he spoke about the last few days of the trial, and said that if nothing happens to December 21, "people start to think immediately about the next date" or to philosophy that the 21st December is the beginning of the seventh period, at which the world will end.
The date will be taken by students and professors.
Several told them that they were going to celebrate "the end of the world."
"I'll call a few friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year-old student of communication Samira Ford.
