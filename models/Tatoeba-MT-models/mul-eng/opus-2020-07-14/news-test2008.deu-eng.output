Food is responsible for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area was the rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, tension was expected to be higher than in November - after 2.6 per cent in October an annual inflation rate was recorded by 3.1 per cent, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 per cent out of 3 per cent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian Nottbank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced its management. According to your estimates, the rising raw materials prices and the slight decline in unemployment will benefit from the creation of an inflation spiral.
The ECB intends to maintain inflation rates by at least two per cent, or at least at least on the two per cent market.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the fields of concern: inflation must be "responsive" to exclude subsequent action needs.
With 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate reached a twelve-year record in Germany in November; in Spain the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The increased food and energy prices were responsible for increasing inflation in the euro area.
The Mattif rating increases by 88 per cent, and the course for Sojabohnen has also reached a record record since 1973.
Food oil and milk products were also a major threat in 2007.
The world market price for Roh oil increased by 52 per cent this year - in the past month, the price per face of the black gold reached nearly $100.
As a result, the ECB will increase inflation in 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent, however, it will be estimated by a decrease of 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts from a 3% inflation rate, the annual average rate is 2.1%.
For 2008 experts estimate that the ECB will double its interest rates.
Gallup short government crisis
The number of Fidesz sympathithians has grown significantly since the beginning of December. The party has been on the largest base since 2002, while the approval for the Socialists has reached a point of 13 per cent yet.
In the case of the party voters, the difference is clearly due to the high resolve of the opposition proponents: more than two thirds (71 per cent) have a fifth (20 per cent) approval for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are a question under parliamentary rule: they come in the general population by two per cent.
The number of participants has increased by a percentage in both camps.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic outlook has continued to deteriorate - never before was the proportion of those who judged the country's economy as "expressively evil" so high (41 per cent), while 46 per cent of them remained "severely bad".
Following more promising views in the spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial position again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population calculates a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth of the population is affected by an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - judged the prime minister's work as "more evil than right".
Thirty percent of the respondents have expressed great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the proportion of the complainants for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% don't trust the head of government, compared with 27% mystery against the Fidesz Party.
One of the indicators of the political vote is the number of those who, I think, could get the discontent with the Prime Minister without change of government.
In late October, 35% of the government and the head of government had spoken after the disturbances, but today this proportion is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees only the solution in new halls.
According to their interest in the referendum, 60 per cent responded that they would "participate with security" and another 20% would vote "probably".
In contrast, the parliamentary elections would take place this Sunday, only 55 per cent would go to the Urins "with security" and 15 per cent would hold their participation for "probably". In view of these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be invisible.
74% would be against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital-Tagged.
As regards the group of participants in the public consultation "with security" the proportions of students, practitioners and hospitals' fees would be even 81, 84, or 89 per cent.
Raised at the top of the screen, Tesco increases by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Bulgarian trade area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% over the last year, with the difference that this year did not increase VAT.
Article of Napi Agriculture
The price of the typical Christmas basket of the Napi has also increased by 16 per cent this year, but in all hypermarket price increases, more than 1,000 HUFs have been recorded.
After the prices in the food markets have been "davonkaloppied" in the last December, the tension is not so bad that it is relatively high, early starting levels.
However, it is quite surprising to consumers that what they have paid for in the last year is still below 9,000 HUF, this year is not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" cart exceeds the magic 10,000 HUF limits to at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remain close to the previous year's level, however, the prices for powder-brushed, nut and mohn are high.
Prices for milk and bread speak the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, however, there were 1kg brothweeks for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price chain on the product under 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola Pfand bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drinking included only 257 HUF.
However, this year cuts the price of the "Napi" commodity basket comparison at the price, and the price of Cora.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping basket compared to the Christmas prices in the past year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by 18 per cent each.
The difference between the cheapest sales volume of the previous year and the lowest prices of the current year was 12%, while the increase in the cheapest sales volume of the previous year and the lowest price of the current year amounted to 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase last year was still at 1.206.00 Forint, however, the VAT increase was observed at the last Christmas season.
This is exactly what has been done: it seems that the owners of the goods could not decide exactly what price savings they should apply in the individual articles, as the effects of price increases on consumer behaviour were invisible.
(If the dealer is planning a product's pace of transition bad, he may fall in the price range, which is based on the traffic intensity.)
In the past year, the tenure of the "Napi" commodity basket has been radically demonstrated that the costiest corb exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, although the price difference in the cheapest corb was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the cost of the most expensive corp cost 1.630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the most cheap, there was a price increase of 1.284.00 Forint.
In comparison with the last two Christmas season, a catastrophic price increase showed that the price of the daily consumer product in the hypermarkets increased by less than 20 months by more than 30 percent.
(This does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: In some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 per cent control over 12 months.
So in near Mehl, too, at eggs.)
However, if you look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible at the last time, since the price level of the product already priced in the previous year has been estimated even in the worst case by almost 10 percent.
It is obvious that mehl deliverers are in a stronger position than the eil deliverers - at least they were able to reduce the drastic price increase to the multitude.
The hypermarkets don't complain about the gold trade crisis; it's been reported for good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three shopping houses are no longer looking at the prices.
It will be purchased from all the large quantities, sustainable food will go to pallets over the Ladentics.
On Monday morning morning, there were endless shouts in all three shopping houses at the casino, as suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported from the country, so many people regret that they could not even achieve the intended consumption, and not only with food, but also with sustainable consumers.
Multiple places are divided into disinfectants
Yourer was recorded more than a thousand infections in hospitals that were to be returned to an inappropriate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not directly attributable to the introduction of the infections, are the leading doctors of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many places are also divided into the disinfectants.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, a MRSA infection was diagnosed shortly.
The antibiotic bacteria were found in a male patient who was administered after a severe accident in the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there has already been a similar infection.
The loss of a severe car accident was removed from the hospital, but later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation was not yet performed because of the bacteria still present in the patient's body.
Up to 10 December this year, disease houses 1094 were notified of multiple-responsible infections to the National Nosocomialis Survey System, thus leading doctors of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many cases of multiple-resisted infections were registered in the hospitals, which should be higher but should be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were resolved by the MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus against methicillin-Oxacylline.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry about a third of the people in their nose, without causing a disease.
SA-conditioned infections (such as haemorrhage, mandating, skin dispersion or swelling) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are healthy.
However, if the funds are highly dosed or not used, they are derived from the well-responsive bacteria antibiotics that rapidly spread within the hospitals.
In particular in patients with weak, or chronic poor functioning immune system, but also in older patients, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause serious infections such as fungal infection or bleeding, so Sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is not unique, such events are part of the day of the hospital.
The infection should not be replaced with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA did not only exist where it is not searched.
Antibiotic resistance
"These patients are isolated, the care staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics that are necessary for the treatment" - Tibor Nyulasi.
However, when they are given into the hospital, patients are tested at MRSA, an infection cannot be avoided at all times.
Samples to be reported
Most of the infections solved by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the prevailing conditions and circumstances are not available to reduce the outbreak or spread of the multi-resisting agent, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly patients, the Spitalians should immediately investigate the patients and isolate MRSA infected.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not often practiced as well.
Not least because there are no references to this investigation outside the State disease case.
Therefore, most cases occur only in day-to-day light if the patient already has a significant MRSA infection, so the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
There are strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine in the European Union, but there are guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary in order to prevent resistance to the medium, but this Directive will not always be included in hospitals.
Among the ambulances or patients in primary care, microbiological trials were even more rare, as was Karolina Böröcz.
Concomitant administration of the disinfectants
Scientific evidence indicates that MRSA is transferred from one patient to the other most frequently by the care staff.
That is why handwashing, or walking of hands and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant weaknesses in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by a rupture infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of insulating infected patients in the home.
The rooms are even often filled, the beds are nearly turned aside, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them from epidemiological sight.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to note, even in the less well-planned hospitals, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly benefit from the outbreak of infections.
Such infections are likely to be less frequent, relatively able to maintain the further spread of the recipient where these protective measures are maintained, as Karolina Böröcz did.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections in the Griff cause enormous costs of health insurance, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its deterioration in the government programme, was maintained.
Following the first signs, the program is successful - as published data, the trend of MRSA infections in England is slow.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the emergence of multi-responsive governments (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as a priority.
Deadline police haven't been involved
In the case of the police chief of the XXII. Car accidents caused by the area with lethal output are now the official suspects.
In the meantime, the police chief of the XXII. Area, who killed a pedestrian on a day of the bus crash, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morva, the press speaker of Budapest's Overstated Administration on Friday after the official charges were submitted.
The hostages confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to the police officer had not consumed any alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police chief booked with his own Pkw in the XXII district in the Kossuth Lajos Street and passed over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street to an unknown location.
(According to STVO, however, this is not a mild condition - the length has, even if footsteppers don't cross the road on the Zebrasite, nachrant.)
The driver is responsible for his injuries after he has been admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the Lunker experienced a shock, then returned his functions and sought pension.
The Budapest State Administration has introduced its findings in advance.
Attila Morva also mentioned that the former chief of police from the beginning had co-operated with the investigators.
Other EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday at the total value of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects, which were implemented with funding from the Cohesion Fund. The credit agreement has already been signed over 100 million earlier, with the current agreement on the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement should also be allocated to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit contract.
In the area of innovation, the Contracting Parties signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which is mainly covered by research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
At the meeting, the U-trainline 4 also came into the language.
It was agreed that, as soon as Hungary has explained the details of the EU's travel financing, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed the total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
Credit credits are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is made available by the EIB with an increase of 8 years, provided free of charge.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is well-known - all of Europe is looking at the Balkan state mentioned earlier.
What, where, and who still buys the EU's most cheap market, which will become very expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is now twice the favorite bottle for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap shipping apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamproo and Vitosa are among the most popular, in the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historical cities Sozopol and Nessebar are the renters, but the real estates around Kavarna and Balcik are also asked more and more.
According to the estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's interior will also attract investors earlier or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the famous area of Russia.
The capital of Sofia also offers attractive offers - trade and office facilities offer the highest rates.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and therefore to call in addition to the summer and winter season in the two other seasons.
Presumptuous investors are already buying in a large style, for example around Bansko.
Analysts are also seeking to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but also interested in France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to let themselves down buy either revitalised real estates of EUR 50-100,000, or houses of EUR 5-15 000, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and availability and communication opportunities are greatly written, but also the proximity to a large city, business and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category belongs to those who are looking for a holiday (Bulgaria was registered in December under the top Ten of the German holiday destinations).
The third group identifies business people who invest with the aim of medium- to long-term value increases.
Real estates in the capital are becoming more expensive, subject to growing demand.
Within the EU, the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years, there has been a price increase of 21 per cent per year.
The tension at the real estate prices is further increased by the arrest of the hostages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As environmental Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the experts' meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulted on the Bali Road Plan, in which emission reduction measures have been established for the period after 2012, thus following the completion of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, there is a strong debate between industrial and development countries.
The United States has already indicated that they do not want to deal with specific numbers, but they would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the Conference is whether the industrial countries are ready to support developing countries both financially and technologically.
There was also an agreement on support for developing countries.
The adjustment funds submitted to the Kyoto Protocol should be managed by a 16-capital Council, which is expected to be read in the UNO's Global Environmental Facility (GEF).
Hungary 6 percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its priority role in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that by 2020 the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (measured at the 1990s), regardless of whether the "Committee after 2012" will be successful or not. The Union would even be willing to apply for a 30% reduction, if other major industrial countries of the world, or developing countries are also willing to fulfil their obligations under force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was to reduce only 5.2 per cent, although the EU had already committed itself to a minimum of 8 per cent with its 15 Member States at the time.
The standard for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the years 1985-87 - a standard that will be fully met by the country, as in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The use is high on Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would be safe to enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow the international emission reduction system, which is also the importance of the IPCC, which has highlighted the international scientific climate change committee of the UN in its recent report.
This would slow the emission reduction, and the increase in earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which would have been extremely difficult and irreparable consequences for scientists.
British Army acts on YouTube
British army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity at the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered itself: In Afghanistan, stationed special units have been loading videos about Taliban operations since March 2006, reports BBC.
The recording of miniatur cameras mounted on helmets will be checked at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they will be placed on the Internet.
Political Message Unavoidably
Aircraft soldiers have already controlled 139 such recordings, their "canal" has been seen more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defencehead Quarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonpeace Office) and the International Peace Threats (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq are available on its own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
The Air Force has originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve to inform the population about the real objectives of foreign institutions.
Such propaganda is almost free compared to conventional television commercials, such as defence experts Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos are always a measure of political message since they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the Government in its own way.
American Games with Game
However, the army must also fight against amateur captures, which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored recordings, also create a network - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: In some hichlerical, "official" propaganda films, the most lost, the bloody sides of the war will not be shown.
From the warheads in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of the videos already used have been loaded on the platform, but the British have only recently discovered them.
The Americans compete in the other way, with the free downloadable game "American Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin through a more or less life-threatening simulation.
Christmas party with Tomla and Pogatsche in the ministry
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is not a cymbal: instead of a Christmas party, she is holding a working conference that allows her employees to relax in 2007 with coffee and pogasche.
Some ministers celebrate with live music, others celebrate Christmas with Tomla or anstones in the staff's hearts.
Party, Christmas vote, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas fetter has already noticed the mothers too.
The largest Christmas festival in a ministry will be held in the defense area, but the staff of the ministry will not be expected to do so.
Children are received by fallen soldiers at the "Witness Day" party, when the "mission party" is hosted by family members of currently stationed soldiers in abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resource is around 25 million for the holidays.
In comparison with other resources, the National Development Agency (NIF) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport are fighting the flows.
The 4.32 million Forint will be held in the future house of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and some 350 of 600 employees will be expected.
The focus of holidays is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tomola solution.
The National Development Agency (NFU) has held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas celebrations on Wednesday at the house of the National Court of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a party.
The salmiste consisted of 1 million Forint, the rest was distributed to the more than 400 paid guests.
According to our information, a section of the IMF is also invited at another Christmas festival organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU branches.
For the festival, the building of the playtheater ("Vigsínhaz") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the officials.
What's the point?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the rooms.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The holidays were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] you shared with: It did not prevail on the ball any ball clothes or accessories.
The ministers for health, work, and self-government are preparing themselves for Puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth officially invites its employees not even to a Christmas party, but to a conference for the anniversary.
It is estimated that with about 180 guests, which - such as the press department - will only be equipped with coffee and pogasche, the party will come out with 350,000 forints.
Minister of Self-Management Gordon Bajniai will simply be arrested with his colleagues in the Ministry's Aula.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas party at its own festival, which is expected to be attended by 436 employees.
The expenditure was measured with 2,500 Forint per head - for this money there is a buffet receipt with subsequent discounts.
Since the beginning of the spring of Janos Veres, the PM employees celebrate this way every year.
However, there will be no correct party vote - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because of the celebration for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites the 20th anniversary of a new year's reception, which is the Christmas celebration of the Ministry this time.
The hundreds of guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városligt"); according to the source of the resource, the expenditure is estimated at 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be loaded.
The receptions that are held each year begin traditionally with a short speech by the Minister and sound with repeated reflections.
As the corresponding press posts report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the external or at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of Christmas holidays, the Ministry of the Environment was unable to provide any assistance to the press department.
In any case, more than 400 guests were loaded to the festival, which will be held at the Art Museum.
More and more forces mobilized for the race line
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation shall set up its coordination committee on Friday for the series starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, on Monday, on the day of the public vote on the health insurance law - begins the work of the labour force.
It will be calculated with strict, significant obstacles to transport, as rail transport is almost complete, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will be deployed up to 13 hours.
Details of the strike on Monday afternoon are shared by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
It will also establish a LIGA-MOSZ Street Committee responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, and from Monday all the organizations that have joined the conflict will be down to work for an indefinite time unless there is no agreement with the Government.
In other words, the end of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the Committees shall act together to discuss the further proceedings.
In view of the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even possible that it will come only in the evenings, or even at midnight, to vote on the health insurance law.
The strike that began on Monday will have to take place with significant obstacles to transport: the railways lay down their work for an indefinite time, the morning is the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies.
At the same time, there will be more road closures.
The call for the strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants will be updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced stricts at an unexpected time, others planning a slow workout.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railways MÁV and the free trade of the VDSZSZ railway, although there were more and more people on the train.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be extended by 13 hours at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 hours early, the LIGA's electricity and heat industries will be down to work for four hours, and the teaching industry will grow. The democratic teaching industry has been calling for 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors is currently extending to different times, the EDDSZ, the democratic cooperation of the health and social workers, a subsidiary of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation in the Associations, holds a second warning line.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the Government withdraws the draft for the reform of health insurance and extends a new concept for social discussion.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will fall from the next year.
Request number three indicates that the required professional groups are already able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the supply lines of the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases State risk
In view of the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian guard, which was supported by the "Moving for a Better Hungary" in August, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In the Institute's Risk Warning Report, the highest political risk is that "in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, there is an increase in existing ethnic tensions between the Ziggeurs and the non-Visual population in Hungary, which could lead to even a short-term introduction of violent ethnic asylum".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provulgating of such a replacement, is the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as an area of political responsibility: "People of the public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma youth agenda."
It is suspected that this will create the problem, make the meaningful dialogue impossible, benefit extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent harassment.
In addition, the research institute believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have not been ultimately due to the enormous attention of the sides of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary is seriously damaged abroad, particularly as regards confidence in stability and democratic reunification".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been constantly on the rise, so since summer 2007, several organizations called "national self-defenses" have been established.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly advocate that their members be prepared to prepare defence tasks (catastrophes protection, country defence, order protection), under the influence of the police, the army, in relation to the State itself," it said.
And further: all of this has been done in accordance with the method, which tries to vary, based on the political and party security of the population, on political efforts as a civil initiative.
The emphasis on the character and uniformity of civil society should therefore not be limited to the environment of legal certainty which could arise at the time of the court's entry into force - it is a political strategy at the same time.
As the analysis is to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian guard are also a risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the introduction of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-young politics.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian garden is not a single phenomenon in Central-East Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was established by the Bulgarian Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the establishment of the Bulgarian guard, the Roman Massacres were located in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the same opportunity to establish the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization of "national protection".
According to your opinion, in the last 17 years, a regular "shower terror" in Bulgaria has been devastating, but the state has remained unhindered and indisputable - so political capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have led to a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it is said, the increased risk of ethnicization is also revealed by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they would be opposed to building their own garden.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard as long as there are many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to their own protection at the risk of political capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Each year, risk analysis reports will be published and risk trends should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk report.
Holidays are not all holidays
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so the practice of working day conversion has been established in the meantime, but we are protected in the coming year less than that.
Also in the EU and America, you understand something else under "Fifday".
The Hungarian legal system differs between public holidays and free working days.
Free working days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are free of work days - the last one to be able to blow off the silver-fields.
All year round we have 14 holidays.
State holidays are the 15th of March, which commemorates the 1848 revolution, and the 23rd of October, the day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20th, on May 1st, we think of our deaths.
In addition, there are two holidays at the Eastern, Penguins, and Christmas.
As our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "Workdays" has been guaranteed in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the longer weeks is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
If this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised, it shall be laid down by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation for a period of years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employers, public employees and officials of the public service.
Except for companies and facilities in which the operation is carried out without interruption, including on holidays.
The Rules of Procedure will only be passed on by the holidays of the year: Since December 24th, the lives of this country remain formal, since most of the days between Christmas and Easter are equal, or take their own holiday.
In the next year, more holidays occur in the weekend, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer conversions in working days than this year.
The calendar will first be set on the work day "on the head", so that people can stay at home for the same four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday may be a day of rest.
The second refurbishment depends on the day of the festival on 23 October: On Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work on Friday, 24 October.
However, the end of the year will remain unsatisfied at the mark of the holiday, after all since December 24th, even if silverester falls on a Wednesday.
Six drawbacks to raise colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, talk, we never get - unharmless lies that will never happen to us again: they bring "color" in the workplace every day.
The question is whether you are accustomed to these small inconsistencies, or you are better aware of the challenge and try to avoid these incomprehensible situations.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," said one colleague.
That you've missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to try it again, perhaps by calling at the marketing department and standing hugely, you would have forgotten to deliver the message (this is the least common method).
In most cases, the matter has been resolved with an apology.
Before you cross into stressful situations, you should consider what you can do to prepare your colleagues for really uncomfortable moments and try to avoid these situations.
Something that doesn't belong to itself?
There's nothing worse than getting a document, office owner, or phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the lift device was still on the desk - today morning is it gone?
Or is the lost doll writer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, there should be nothing left of the colleagues, because they will be duly disappointed when they find that something is gone.
So, don't get any envelopes or post-it from the office, because it could meet itself: nothing more if you need it urgently.
You're talking about my colleagues' privacy?
There is no effective means to maintain a treaty that has already been established in the world.
Who's with who, what's done?
Where and why?
You should not attach the information (or suspicions) to your colleagues' privacy as far as possible!
And if someone opens up and delivers us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
The best thing to do is move like a grave instead of just not to fix the presence, even if others know something about the problems of the colleague.
No reason for a disease reported?
If you call in the office to report on painful headaches because you just feel uncomfortable or just want to get out of it, you should be aware of one of the clear things: your own work, unskilled results, projects with fixed terms must now be done by your colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don't normally play with the colleagues!
If you already know that you will not be created in the office the next day or that something could happen, why you must stay at home, you should report it right away so that neither the colleagues nor the chief are expected to face the absence.
Sum, cookies, phone calls
You're just in your work, but are you suddenly hurt by your fellow colleagues' latrines?
Did you ever hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You shouldn't let your colleagues talk with summaries, singing, talking (which leads you through their heads), trampling, lasting scarfs or nerves.
All of this can be very disturbing even if they are not just covered in a task (written, planned, organised).
Is the others always responsible?
If a project is not completed correctly, you should forget an important letter or important message, you should not look for the blame of your own failure in others!
As far as possible, you should not talk to the chaos in the office or to the ladies!
The best thing to do is admit his mistake and apologize if others were involved too!
The question of how to recover the bug, or how to keep the damage, is just about everything!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Traininghouse and sleeping: Easy for home, but nothing has been lost in the office!
Not even then, you should dress so low if it really allowed the workplace!
Just don't be too shy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself as much as you would like to dress in the office - if you like, be nice and elegant!
It wants everyone to be right - or how you become uninterested for others
Stop and go traffic, the car is in the middle of the morning.
From the radio explains a rare melody: the sound of a mouse, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm driving the volume higher.
The time is changing, to the previous sounds comes from the bass, and as a real sound wave, it's a female chor.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which explains on mr2.
The home music scene has not just been popular for a long time with a qualitative electropop.
But now you can see the situation differently if you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so often new and exciting production from the home digital underground scene, slows down a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar quilt is "in", the domestic electropop proves: There are new things under the sun.
Bálázs Zzáser started in Pécs, sang himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a venshaus does not represent two pfefers - he begins to describe his own way.
The break with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, but he was only able to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g., the music of his music) (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which was originally held in smaller clubs, was first known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" was first selected from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, almost single, also in the western marketable trend set.
There was no doubt that Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they liked to wear these brands as well.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album that now appeared with the title "Cannott Walk Fly instead" could open up new ways, but the title has already stressed the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression was created at the time when Baláz Zzáser was still on the way with another band.
The air, flying play would also be fine, however, in addition to the essential character of the music - the time spirit and the trend - the guitar, the influence of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who works with the band "The Puzzle" in England, presented himself at the Millennium Prize.
A member of the album has even made it to the radio player - who has successfully installed the earphones with the "Wings of Love" number since the latest from early till late pop music.
It's all right, so (?)
The hvg.hu questioned at Balázs Zzáger.
hvg.hu: This new hit asks the question: How far do your music keep a certain shadow?
Ballázs Zzáser: The term "Schicht music" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two castles in pop music, and not Mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or ground music can be visible and unsatisfied, so they can be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The reception of the audience also works independently of language and country boundaries according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In the country, especially in the western part of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or twos go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that surround them, much more careful because they also hold them for a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many of your music do you hear?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that ever more comes to our concerts.
But we never made up for the market.
We do not create music to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is most impressive at the concerts, where there is already a mutual impact, but it is only in the inevitable changes of the moment.
However, one thing happened to me: If you want to do it all right, you are no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We are not really going his way, even though it seems that you are always trying to interpret this in our music.
We see ourselves more like a teammate who trusts the musical presence of the other and lets them explode.
At first, of course, our work was inexhaustible, since several of us came out of his gang and joined another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of Mr2 Petöfi is "Wings of Love" and first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style in the direction of a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn't have plans to write a hit that should then be kept as a quote for the album.
There's more to this song.
It was thought to be the end of the album, with which we wanted to solve the soundorgies and the difficult issues.
hvg.hu: How have you chosen the six singers?
Why was she right, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The reason was to make a gay choir.
Then came the idea of bringing together the choir from dedicated soloists of the home music scene.
So the sixth-party chor was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Ennikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized after "underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Are you sure you want to have the song, or have the girls designed it?
B. Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number was still "needs something".
The record of the appeal was formally requested after a vote.
I've caught up with Melody that night, and later they've learned the girls.
It all came practically on offer and shocking spontaneous.
I can remember that I was quite electric at the time, but it's already the "Divas" thing.
With my voice alone, the song would never become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the disc and at the concert, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no Solo Party (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing perfectly together and are not more than the music, so their song will not only be accompanied by music.
They're also on the stage.
Is that an intention?
B.Z.: Because they stood behind, it was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not want them to have any solo roles.
The number also means that you should forget your ego a little bit, forget who came and where you are going, let's just let us get this particular flight, the flight of love.
I would also like to see others of this euphoric state that we have dreamed of when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most exciting song?
B. Zs.: In fact, no one has ever done anything about the musical work, but it has given the mix more difficult tasks.
For example, "Dorian Gray's dilemma", where I played on a concert keyboard, or "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove did not want to work anymore, but after and after he added everything together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is changing with the concerts and even now where I have the album "free of charge".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From the Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Peanuting maclers risked for low-valued billions
Non-repudiation of landfills
This is the name of his former employees Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankeries Société Generale, owner of this Komerční banka.
She came on her way to almost EUR five billion.
But it seems even more so that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same for his colleagues, and it was certainly not impossible.
Unlike all large banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's more physically weak," was to hear from the mouth of his predecessors who showed him to the police.
But how did the French media, for example the newspaper Le Monde, publish the saying that he was a man who had achieved a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of the last year with his business profits?
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he insisted in his statement.
In summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity to do so had been delayed at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those coming in late, or those that had already had previous payment problems, would be exposed to difficulties.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
A lot of people didn't believe it and kept the right.
Over the course of the year, he had earned up to 1.6 billion euros.
"If I had worth the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel continues, saying that he definitely had nothing for himself.
During the entire audience, he says he liked the notes so that he won't get on the bad side.
He even managed to lead his head behind the light, even though the Eureka Towers were generally interested in his business.
Risk profile
He was afraid to fly?
It's too late.
"I thought it was the bad fact that I deserved 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Generale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at Lyon University.
His annual income was about $55,000.
After two years he was already a macro assistant and in 2005 he became a self-sustained mackerel with an annual amount of $90,000.
However, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"When I first spoke in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Keriel explained to the research staff.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Allianz, he earned a lot by putting a half billion euros in the London bombings on short-term losses of this title.
And that was the solution - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you go
"It's like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the chiefs knew of everything, they knew it relatively well.
"As long as I earn money, man closes his eyes."
But then the great tribulation came at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to figure it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer the bank's employees.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros on its way.
And how did they get him to the worse?
He was surprised by a vacation.
"I only took four days from last year.
A macro who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to shoot him in the map," said Kerniel in conclusion.
Chechnya has the chance to get to 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday in total, by which the Czech Republic can reach EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the sums that Czechs can receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive some 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will fly into the transport industry.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that can be obtained from the Fund.
This money is increased according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be available in the next year over 90.8 billion.
The "enterprise and Innovation" programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies to earn money for innovative businesses.
The companies should therefore receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In the previous financial acquisition from the EU funds, Czechs from the new accession countries are at least successful.
Nicaraguan Court of Justice confirms twenty-one-year sentence for the Presidents
On Thursday, a court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, which was sentenced to 100 million dollars (about 1.8 billion dollars) in 2003 due to financial fines.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hasienda at the Nicaraguan Metropolis.
Whether the former state capital (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind the guitar, the news agency AP is currently unclear.
The President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, will now depend on the federal authorities if you allow Alemán to leave his sentence at home or if he has to go to prison.
A court stated four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred the government’s money to foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts were actually among their relatives and most closets.
Some of this money finally settled in a fund that had set out to finance its 2001 election struggle.
The budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is valid.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this Government and the opposition was adopted without the support of the coalition majority.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) was still authorized for the current year because the Minister Sobotka (from this party) had submitted to him, and the ČSSD could not accept it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the mystery agreement against the government, nothing was dramatic this time.
The House of Lords took little note of this traditional, yet the most important law in all peace.
That's some sort of paradox.
Everything begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether or not one likes it.
The budget is a key component of policy, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a better subject for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to him.
A conflict among politicians is much more interesting for the public than for the next numbers.
The state-owned holdings in previous social democratic governments are below three weaknesses which cannot be eliminated for 2008:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure due to legislation, where it is not only about interest, but also about social expenditure, which has been decided by the "suspending" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communist) in the last year before the elections.
The second is the definition of budgetary policy as a consequence of the first weakness.
The third restriction is in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the Communities.
However, the greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and in some ways under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors have given rise to excessive debt claims that they owe to their spouses in excess of taxes, charges and bank loans.
In recent years, they were obliged to pay these debts through massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks that they had received in the course of the state's privatization.
Now this source is already available.
As long as we only hold to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy has been going through a growth phase, as the rest of the world has been a few years.
This provided an opportunity for their governments to arrange public finances.
Instead, these governments owed the state more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have become much more profitable than our Republic.
This is a huge thing to be written mainly by the former governments.
We belong to the countries that are at the global level at the lowest level threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes that have just been overflewed in the last few years.
Even if it has been achieved to raise a part of the unintended populist expenditure that has been adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no disbursement of interest rate and a pension reform in the future, then virtually every policy in this country will end, and, as far as the power is concerned, it will not remain as a clean administration.
It is only easy to pass on when it is said that then will be officials of the ruling politicians, who share the majority of taxes mechanically on interest and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but only the destruction of normal expenditure can be covered by public spending.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns proposed for 2008 would have been excessive if the former governments had not spent in the last ten years, what had just happened.
If we do not really want to make it clear that we will be fully managed by the ruling politicians, we must be patient and not too strong with this coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and charges, we want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only this allows a progressive implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The American Federal Reserves, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
In this way, more than $100 billion will be achieved through auctions on the currency markets.
On these auctions, the banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends $40 billion to auction, and 24 more is sealed for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
Following the accession of 11 September, it is the first time that the Central Banks of the individual States agree on a coordinated procedure to reverse the effects of a financial crisis.
"This step is to overcome the greatest difficulties in the economy, so the growing lack of free capital that banks can afford," wrote a report for their customers Bernard Baumohl from the Advisory Company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the Central Bank has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added the grow-out in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unencumbered loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really worried about what can still happen when they decide on this," said ABN Amro, Kieran Davies' chief economist.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the honour that if the banks have a hard access to loans themselves, their credit will also be more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and destroy the American economy in a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided on this, after they had not been reached, to reimburse the LIBOR, the London Interbank rate used for the loan between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, while the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the halting of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, although the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Class: Ecological debate is inconsistencies
Global climate change is said to affect most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again referred to the problem of global warming.
The criticism now came to the UN International Conference on Climate Change on Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he pointed out that the discussions of the Ecologists were hopeless.
It is therefore unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which constitutes a rare mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-fire, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasized in the presentation of his books that this matter was very important to him and that he was therefore committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often look at the cartoons of my views."
Interested parties could now re-read his setting without delay.
Klaus reminded himself that he was not a climateist, but he had his opinion on sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he was a academic, capable, able to understand and evaluate professional treatments, have experience with statistics and also be economical.
As the principal message of the book, he referred to the fact that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are so normal that it does not give the scientists any consensus on warming that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are excessive, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he held it as someone who has experience with comprehensive systems, for irreconcilable, other unconfirmed views, he sees it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On the question of delegates, he once again stated that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against the militarized eco-activists who do not take a look at the relationship between the rise and the pursuit."
About the same topic, Klaus had already spoken in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people couldn't change their leadership
600000 car drivers canceled the deadline to exchange their old leadership, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can create a new leadership by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the streets without valid driving authorisation.
As a result, the authorities have largely not replaced those who do not want to travel anymore.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of figures, the mayors of the capital will be overwhelmed with requests, and the interest in the exchange will grow this week.
The city administration produces around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stop for about half an hour.
In Prague some 140000 car drivers have not yet changed their driver's appearance.
The exhibition will take 20 days for a new guide.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Autofarms who do not create the proposed exchange until the end of the year and leave without valid driver visas receive a fine from January.
The dividend pays up to 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also be used with a reference to the transfer.
In the case of a transfer, the penalty may be increased to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, those of the Community may also receive a penalty which is not at all valid.
He could have, so it seemed, a punishment of nearly 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the authorities to put up arms and at the highest level to impose a penalty of 1000 crowns.
The speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, was afraid of a thousand crown punishments.
The guide is a document where everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It doesn't have to be a personal way, everyone, and even a valid one.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their leadership.
It is sufficient to send him to the competent Community office or to send him by letter.
During the course of the year, leadership was invalid, which was issued between 1964 and 1993.
In general, however, drivers need to exchange additional types of leadership.
People with leadership skills from 1994 to 2000 have more than three years for the exchange.
The validity of leaderships issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
Hanzelka is responsible for some 2.6 million more leadership.
Justice lower punishment for detectives who were connected to Berdich
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kojřík, who are accused of having done things together with the band of David Berdych, received 13 relatively 10 years' imprisonment.
The Court of Justice of Prague ruled that it had reduced its punishment in a relationship for two years.
Initially, the detectives of the "Amitate for Combating Organized Crime" were 14 relatively 12 years old.
Against today's judgment there is no possibility of employment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this case, but firstly he is the first to be tried.
In other processes, however, he had been sentenced to 16 years in total.
He can't be judged any more.
In January 19 persons were charged with the involvement of terrorist attacks, and today the Supreme Court has dealt with the profession of 16 of them.
Most of the accused contend at the beginning with the grounds, it is a construction case.
The Central District Court subsequently handed over information to police officers, including Berdich criminals, from the sources of the police, covering various robbery incidents and half members of the band to avoid the prosecution.
The band survived for Opava and Kojörík 30 percent of the bet.
In the case of a complaint, it relates to the fines of the band from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, in the case of robbery, the victims often suffer serious injuries, but also in the possession of unauthorized weapons.
In household investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel, laser wire, and a machine gun.
The band has succeeded in reaching the complaint through its robberys for millions of crowns.
In addition to almost 20 men in this process, Justice Berdich and a number of others recognized as guilty of further robbery.
Other men from the area of Berdichs have to be responsible for another process, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulej, who are in the Irish port and are waiting for the final decision on their delivery to be prosecuted in the Czech Republic, have thus far ceased.
Children Replaced - Account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a liaison clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Tříbíč 12 million crown damage plus court costs.
For each mother every three million, for the father every two million and for the children every one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Dostal, is therefore not fully in agreement with the Velebas proposal.
"A proposal like this will help us, it is too high," Dostal said after today's discussion.
"But in order for us to draw up an opinion on this counter proposal, we need the opinions which have created the opposite side.
We're going to find out if it's ever made sense.
But we are in the view that this should be for everyone in the hundreds of millions," Dostal stressed.
The amount should be moved between 100000 and 200000 kroners for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jablonov wanted a million crowns for every month that they had not raised their biological daughters.
For Veleba, he served as a basis for decommissioning transactions, which the university hospital in Prague Motol had developed for him.
The parents of children experience psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depth, depending on experts from the field of psychology and psychology.
Men trust the stress situation better, even if they saw themselves fighting, they would have been able to prevent the evolution of newborns.
The women come back with the effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is just going on, Veleba decided the content together.
Veronika and Nikola were transferred to Tříbič, the hospital nurse in Tříbič, last December 9.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Príbiyslave, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jablonov.
The district chief of Vysochina (Böhmish-American height) handed over 100000 crowns to each family at the end of October as substitutes for expenses arising from the illness in Tříbíč, which was responsible for the area.
All hospitals in Chechnya are protected by laws because of the obligation of port.
In the event of doubt, they must reach a reserve fund, but they can only request assistance from the carrier.
The courts have reached similar low amounts of damage, the amounts determined by tables, and have moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polívka came to Nandachei's Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the battle on the brand "Kingdom of Nanadhei".
The judge of the District Court in Ostrava, however, used the name "Walachischer King" first, but the project had built a team for Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in years.
Polivka did not take part today in the negotiations.
As a result of his attorney, however, the matter is probably not over and his mandate is likely to be appealed.
"The struggle is that Mr Haribish and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitor," said Polívkas Anwort after the discussion.
All presented themselves with the words "Walach Kingdom" just this actor and comic.
The same opinion is also Haribish.
"We have a work for almost ten years behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities," he said.
Next to him is the battle of money.
"After years they have found that the project is successful and that they can have something of it.
They want to win parasites at our work," he continued.
Lukrativas
The court then used the name "Walachischer King" for the first time in a television broadcast.
In 1993 he was recruited by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But this was not in harmony with the intention of setting up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the thought of giving the Waalak's passports.
From an original spatic action, a business and business activity were crystallized out and the Haribish then joined the establishment of the company "Walach Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of his name and signature in the passports and even praised his owners when visiting his farm and his theatre.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
The judge also pointed out today that Haribish used only the idea that Polivka had made in the "Manage" message for his business views.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Kalachi Kingdom," the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was Haribish and his team, who had dedicated themselves to him.
The cooperation of today's fragmented parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš for Polivka organized the official funeral in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the struggles between Polívka and Haribish have begun to begin, which are reflected in the phrase "King Boleslavs I. selected until the day of the Holy Numerals".
The governing role then took place at Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as queen's mother.
In 2002, Polívka appealed against Harabiš and his company against the complaint that the court today filed.
Clearness in the fight could bring the fighting by Haribish about the throne and half the princess.
There should be a new king.
He didn't want details and a term yet.
"We don't want to overcome anything.
It should be something like the king's summaries in the Nandachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Habibish.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Missing advantage
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its characteristics were not very valuable, the quality of the movement, the linkage and the processing could be referred to as less than half of it.
But now he's his follower, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and he's much better.
The KBI with the name SW is still a piece more, and I just remain to review my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain for example about the low headness on the front seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the Kambi's carousel has been designed so that no two-metre man will suffer.
Fast Forwards
I'm just going through the interior room for a short time so I don't want to go too far.
It's a really successful design, where I'm just getting caught up in the middle of the tunnel.
I'd like to welcome something more designer design, where the car makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and over the times are where we may complain about short seats or headaches.
The content has also improved significantly compared to 206.
As far as the range offer is concerned, you can also see here the enlarged measurements of the carousserie.
In Kombi, too, the already mentioned lack of copper is eliminated.
Coffee in the coffee room
But the main thing in this car is the laderium.
I have to call it (also because of the tear-off window) very well-fashioned and space-saving.
The halls are equipped with maintenance grates that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, let each other withdraw, and also hold more difficult objects.
But we'll keep it on the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which is a higher average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle in Czech, this class, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the peugeot remains in a clear supply of 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a vacation abroad or when a child car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still need to mention the very flat layer of the back seat or the very low ceiling.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a fourzyrlinder petrol engine with a heat engine of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's how a 1600-cubik engine should look like a family hackback.
He's empty, he's got a low consumption and he's getting away well.
If I compare him with his opponent at Skoda, who sometimes works as if his blast was hiding with a lamp, then I can only be impressed by him.
The Price List Speaks Bonds
The price of this car is not just popular.
But we need to remember that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good motor.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine is still rising from 329900 crowns.
With our engine, it costs 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test vehicle is also available once again with 80,000 crowns.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic ship exchange resolution, electric window lifts and...
So the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once you count the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a similar sum.
So only the decision that you want to choose remains.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is not achieved
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, leading to further development of local education in the Middle East.
The integration of Eastern Europe continues to be a series of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants are committed to violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the asylum arrangements between native and Slovak immigrants are generally increasing.
There have been conflicts, scandals and riots among students, and there has been a shift in the relationship between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham found a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself in order to protect the young from racial prejudices.
The police also had to attack two minor-year-old girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had apparently made racist remarks against the man and had beaten him with stones.
"When we went home, a young man fell on a bus and knocked on us.
When I told him he was going to stop, he kept us with apples and bees and then wiped out his bed," a mother of Slovak students of the newspaper The Times described another unbelievably incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the natives referred to the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe even as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned relate to the growing tension between indigenous and immigrants in British schools.
In Britain 70,000 Slovaks have been reported to come to work here.
About 30,000 Slovak students are visiting British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors it is indeed an island of freedom.
What you always expect from your holiday will be fulfilled if you only choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves or a sea, peaceful as a treasure.
Palms and All Inclusive with kellners that offer on the beach Pizza, ice and contaminated cocktails.
Kitsurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find that in sufficient measure.
Only on one island do you find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the great ancestors.
By the time of Spain, Cuba was their base for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place you've ever seen a human eye.
Havanna was first moved to a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had bought in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel was created at the end of the 20th century.
Building was one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban) was popularly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, houses grew up, over the broad boulevards were cars that counted on the cultural symbols of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Cojémar he had his yacht.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna you can also leave your autogram.
At the bar at the National Hotel, you can mix Cocktails completely to your liking.
And the cultutatos of the five-year-olds are still here in Havanna, because the first imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salt and hot air have long been different.
May Havanna, especially his oldest part, be strong down, anywhere you find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just released, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, it has provided green light for this development.
In the last five years, not only new hotels have been created in Havanna, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marot that is unique to the world and is especially attractive to railway lovers.
The sugar rose from abandoned plants brought steam and oil-based sugar-producing powders to the sugar-containing industries.
Your park has not been renovated over decades, and so you see beautiful and fully functional Lokomotives, whose elderly guests are standing in the museum for a long time.
Flight destinations
The most important places are not allowed by the majority of Cuba's visitors.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havanna anymore.
It is only to mention that there is a museum in Hemingway's already mentioned site, whose visit should not be allowed by those who may be this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque surroundings.
The upper vegetation grows on the halkbeds.
The mogotas, alkügels and fins, sleighed out of the valley floor, gathered fruity soils, which are also covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco can be built.
In his final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havanna's cigarette factories.
It may also seem interesting that there was the Chilean consequences of the "Major Zeman" television series.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
She brought peace and prosperity to trade with slaves and sugar.
The rich rose in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French visitors, has not changed since four centuries.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was still no road in the last five years of the century that would have linked the area to the other country.
This isolation means that it remains unattended.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was removed, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the environment, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "number of sugar factories".
Then you should go to the Casa de la Musica, which lives after darkness, and where the music doesn't move until morning.
Baracoa
This town is known as the most beautiful island in the east of Cuba.
Surely this view will also be influenced by the way there.
Both roads led by Guantánamo have to overcome high and circular mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly affected by human invasions.
This eastern preposteral post of Cuba was adopted by UNESCO thanks to its unprecedented nature in its world record.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it was built about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, is located, is to see several taverns, of which El Yunque is the most famous one.
About the coffee, the Roma, the cigarettes, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Swine Book and the Isla de Pinos Islands, the Tropical Cabaret, the Holy of Cuban Patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves come from may write many pages of it.
But as you say, it's better to look with your own eyes.
Associates in Afghanistan are passive, claimed Americans.
A small number of soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States following the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should design a concrete plan, according to the words of Minister of Defence Robert Gates, for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to its ideas, and in Scotland, the representatives of the countries who stationed units in the south of the country were agreed.
In addition to increasing opposition from the Taliban side, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, is increasing its activity in NATO units, the UK sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a forward development is fragile, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
Another part of it is to enable the inhabitants to start a continuous development of the economy and security," says the British Defence Minister Des Browne of BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels has achieved the highest status since five years, according to the American army.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, even by six per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of which are located in the southern territory.
As a result, the United States, however, has been subjected to an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they require additional hijackers, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and about how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today the NATO Secretary-General, Jaap de Hope.
"I am not satisfied with what we have available in Afghanistan to countries and in the air.
We have about nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we need," De Hope said Reuters's agency to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the countries involved, there is also a struggle over the past few months to see whether all the allies in Afghanistan give their best.
For example, due to Passivity, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British boulevard "Sun" called this week the German soldiers as Faulpelze.
"Afghanic Non-Stuary: The Germans make games while our boys fight," the "Sun" wrote in an entry that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing the tent.
The German image magazine went through and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will increase by one billion in 2009
On each check, a state debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion dollars by the end of September.
The government had planned to blame this year with 159.2 billion coins.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of public budget policies.
The debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion dollars by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they are estimated to be 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its statements on the state debt of the beginning of October.
On each check a debt of 84000 crowns falls.
Over the last year, the state owed more than 111 billion dollars.
"To date it seems that we will be able to exceed the limit of a billion crowns in 2009 due to the lower deficit for the coming year.
The next year the debt should be moved between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, analyst of the following Finance, observes: "We could come to the surplus of a billion in 2009.
If so, it depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation at the political stage changes, and the politicians should be more prepared to save, it could last until 2010.
But from such a change, I do not go out," he noted.
Debt growth
The State debt is borne by the debt of the government and is mainly due to the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by taxes, government debt payments, direct loans or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt increased this year to 719.4 billion dollars.
The foreign debt of the state is currently about 1.7 billion dollars to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable debt came to an end in September 803.3 billion crowns, and since June it has reached 13.7 billion.
The average incidence of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased from the year 1 to the third quarter by 13 percent, which is really much in view of how well the economy goes.
It is interesting that growth is to be recorded mainly in debt transfers, where growth is 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt increases, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the treatment of public debt for 2007 suggest that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion dollars for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion dollars due to the better development of public budget policies.
This is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is clearly reaching 76 billion dollars this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also the maximum planned funding for the Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten billion reserve for the payment of interest, the financing of state debt flows for 43 billion and the contributions to the European Investment Bank at 1.8 billion.
Because she has given a name to a Teddy bar, she was brought before a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who was charged in Sudan for the persecution of Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a court in Khartum for 15 days and subsequent expulsion.
The British was charged with allowing students from six to seven years of age to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although every expression of the Islamic prophets is denied.
She would've deserved to be trained.
After the parents of students complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who was active at the Unity High School of Khartum was arrested on Sunday at home and charged under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code for Islam.
In fact, this matter takes place in September when the teachers ask their six-to seven-year-old students to look for a name for the classenddy.
The children beat eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, told school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class ends, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as favorite names.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophets, but above all, one of the most common predominances in Sudan.
Next, the children have created a book for the class, with the picture of the beer and the picture title My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not take a picture with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the expression of the Islamic prophets is considered to be a suggestion of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to bring her up a religious belief, I just regret that she had asked the children to vote for a name, which she thinks is just an innocent mistake.
A view that tells many of the students who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in the class.
It is thought that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given name in Britain, which exists in 14 different English manuscripts.
This often chosen name by Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the prophets (which is often given to the first-born of a family).
But how do the rules apply to the use of this name?
For example, can you give him a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the error
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo spent Wednesday mornings in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion session without being able to overcome their disputes about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status , explained the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna .
Stressing that the peace in the region is at stake, the American opponent Frank Wilsner Belgrad and Pristina called on them to fulfil their obligations to achieve peace and to continue the discussions on the end of the negotiations.
No violence will be expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are clear tensions.
End of the hearings on 10 December
The Troika media, which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet once a day in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the Albanian-speaking province could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediar Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko reached the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the past August of UNO had received a new commission.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the completion of their mediation mission on 10 December.
The Russians who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council were on the basis of further negotiations on this amendment.
Russia was and remains the speaker of a negotiated solution, an acceptable solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries maintain independence under the supervision of the EU for the only solution to the future.
Pristina is ready to announce this on the one hand if the Security Council should not decide on its own interests.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached , the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, met at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations had been conducted since Monday of the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade for the autonomy of a past which led to death and deportations.
Domino-Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo before the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence in the province.
Belgrade believes that there is a particularly "domino effect" in a region that is still very weak through the independent wars of the 90s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had concluded that every decision would be taken solely and exclusively in the Security Council, where the Russian allies had a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
The Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica explained that only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia.
These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.
The journalist, Fatmir Sejdiu, replied that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status , adding that every unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking people will be carried out in accordance with the Western countries.
Bush concluded an agreement between Israel and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Conference of Peace, which was held on Tuesday under its leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israel and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further explained that Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive arrangement of the 60-year old disputes between their two peoples.
In the case of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must implement its co-ordination work, Bush explained that he reminded the two parties of their obligations in view of the road plan for peace, which it had agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian occupation under Abbas were aimed at an end to a peace treaty that would clarify all open issues without exception, including central issues.
This name includes the three serious problems that are mainly addressed by the conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the state of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were displaced during the 1948 conflict from their home, which is in the present state of Israel.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations would be carried out comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the word on his side, he committed himself to conduct the upcoming arms disputes directly and without interruption and to make sure that they can be terminated before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli who are close to each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has indicated that Bush has received a guarantee in this sense by Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries in the way that Israel offers peace, in exchange for its return from all Arab territories that were occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis presents a road in the history of the Middle East, especially because it affects the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, meaning the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Arabic daily funded by Saudi money.
The police are not responsible in the view of state officials.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and reports are against.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the findings of the National Police Discipline Authority (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, a police car was on the Rue Louise-Michel direction of Williers-le-Beel.
He had no use, but he was on the floor, and a police speaker explained with 40-50 km/h, without blue light.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, so not released for public transport (see below), came, driven by two young people without helmet, with very high speed.
It broke the left side of the police car after it had violated its right-wing procedure, a policeman continued to explain.
The alcohol control carried out in the vehicle is very negative.
The condition of the vehicle (revealed cot planes, split windscreens, removed rods) is evidence of the gravity of the fire.
Very quickly, early in the morning, the government officials of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that the IGPN had entrusted it with an investigation of "acts of the inequitable murder and the lack of assistance to persons at risk" in line with the main public security leadership of Val-d`Oise.
On the afternoon, at a press conference, the government officials explained that they had excluded the IGPN from the police's responsibility at this stage.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard on Sunday evening, the police's version, namely that this small force wheel has reached its left hand relatively quickly.
Yesterday, there was a sort of rile, certainly caused by the movement of the footsteps on the ground, that the two vehicles were still intertwined until the police were able to break it.
Vehicles have been seized and become subject to technical consideration.
The body name of the two victims was revised yesterday.
What happened then?
Yesterday, in Williers-le-Bel, a mob quickly made the round, so the police had left the accident very quickly, without the help of both young people.
Although the IGPN remains quite cautious, it would also exclude any serious errors in this matter.
A police source follows this is a more difficult aspect of the findings that are needed for further investigations and where you need to go very carefully.
Liberation has touched a few moments after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct look at the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the sick sister in the hospital, to try to live her again, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely broken cop who turned.
Two more tried to live again, one of the young people who called the fourth.
In view of the tension that had quickly shaped the case and, as it seems, because of the uncertainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers of colleagues who had been attacked in an accident were taken into the car.
Still speaking of this witness, the rescue forces are about twenty minutes after the police leave.
They have also used heart mass, but they have left.
I'm not going to let it be claimed that the police were not helping the young people.
You've read this young man's first help.
The fire rage is coming right now.
It was done everything to try to save them, on the other hand stressed the state minister.
In Pakistan, the effort is increasing
On Monday, the Pakistani police shot down the first demonstrations since two days before General Musharraf was expelled from the emergency.
As a result, there were about 2,000 prosecutors in Lahore, the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, who demonstrated opposition to the measures taken in the context of the emergency, who were injured by the train forces that used the order forces there.
Those who fought it with stones, with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police lawyers attacked and injured.
Several would be provisionally established.
In Islamabad, the prosecutors of the Supreme Court of Justice called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of almost 500 arrests by opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had occurred in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Northern).
On Monday, the opposition received support from the religious parties united in the powerful Mutthahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency, and the waste that had been committed before Muharraf.
Musharraf promises no longer apply
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special action announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharrafs again in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and dismissed by his office.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court , declared by the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharrafs has promised to give the order on the army and to become a civil president no longer valid since the emergency was called, declared on Monday by the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would withdraw his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which he ended his first term as President.
The Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be moved by January.
In addition, the Pakistani Government deplores the reasons for the country's conscientiousness, which President Musharraf had received from his deputy leader, a place of residence.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unexpected births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Gesetz, which allowed the arrest in France, is not planned by three pregnant women (36%) as a study of the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unexpected births.
The Ined appreciates that the different methods of prevention such as the pill or spirals still show a loss rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% to 60% today in 1970, however, the liberalisation of the contraceptive has enabled better control of fertility.
In any case today eight of ten generations have been carefully planned.
In one of the five couples even calculate exactly the month, and, if possible, in the morning, the age at which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his cameras from the possession of the International Space Station (ISS) have been spent over seven hours in the world to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A waiting increase, due to its duration, the removal of residential modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronomers to carry out the repair, has obtained several records.
The problem arises in the middle of the night when the astronomers had downloaded the Harmony module from the spacecraft Discovery, a large part of the cylinder-forming, which should soon take up the European and Japanese scientific works.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you need to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy module for power generation over solar collectors already located on the ISS in order to put it in its final position.
After replacing it, the property was restructured by the solar collectors of the module, whose span width was 76 metres.
And it happened that one of the collectors who let themselves be destroyed like an accordion was damaged by a cable sealed over a length of about a meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to harm the collector anymore.
The astronomers who originally left the spaceway Discovery for a control step and then another solar collector whose rotation system was wrong should be repaired, found forced to turn to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to move here to carry out the repair at the end of the 30-metre-long-run arm of the space train that was brought to the station.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well developed body and long arms.
Thus, the 46-year-old doctor was selected to operate the damaged solar collector .
After taking full account of the damage, he crossed the wrong cable and had a kind of scissors on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained close to the lock, and, from inside, from the other astronomers, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the possession.
The tool he used, a mini hockey sticker, with an insolator, was designed to prevent and build on the solar collectors that built hundreds of people to prevent an electric hit, the astronomers on the station's board had invented and constructed.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely fired before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon the astronomers enjoyed half a day of rest before returning to the spacecraft tonight seven astronomers to the spacecraft Discovery to be expected to take the flight back to the ground.
The title of the EADS at the birth is Sanctified
After the Group announced air traffic and defence that it would have to be issued between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion to counter the A400M return, the EADS action currently shows a significant rise in the Paris buffer.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros in Paris.
The group was obliged to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again with regard to the delay caused by the slow development of the A400M engine which slows down the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport vehicles amounted to between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus , were announced by the parent companies of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce on Thursday the new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007, without further details.
The group also notes that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month return.
In order to remember that the business performance of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, due to the delay of another programme, the costs associated with the very large A380 trailer.
The group originally provided for a first delivery of A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The selection mode of the quintuple
On Sunday it will not be alarmed when the Urns are counted: the mass of Russians will be decided for President Putins Party, United Russia.
After a very successful election campaign, it confirms its efforts to stability, even to authoritarianism.
Three days before the elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed a message to the voters, who were already registered, but whose content will be kept secret.
He does this in his own capacity as a top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, the President had not seen anything when he received the foreign emissaries, and he was pleased to deliver a new point of attack against the Western Powers charged with immigration - his favorite theme during the election battle.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for fair elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without interference, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they remained there.
She engages in a campaign of persecution.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that it had never given such dirty choices, not even in the time of Elstin.
After the repression of the demonstrations last week, ex-Schooltmeister Gary Kasparovder was sentenced to five days' imprisonment, according to his lawyer, to continue his visit.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
Following these parliamentary elections without delay, two further questions are raised:
Who's going to become Putin's next president?
The office journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have been informed by 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he has been elected 2000 and has been re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is unable to act for a third term.
And now there's no trace.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of Parliament and of the General Party of Russia, which will be elected by the Government and the President?
What is always going to be, in Parliament's elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will be triumphed.
That's tradition.
The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Homo Soviets, they are not the Lord of their destiny, meaning the sociologist Lev Goldkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg goes back even further: the civil society has grown very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries to Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again pointed to the model of a state of patriotism, which was fully adopted by the people, so much more because of this new patriarchalism, there was no terror, but a certain economic advantage, I think Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free pieces ignore the personal responsibility they have placed shortly after the fall of the UdSSR.
How long will it last?
These phenomena concern all social events, including the business world.
And the Administrative Board understands the status quo: 65 Governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local election list of the Union of Russia.
The new freedoms that come from the west are often the same as Chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians are not even voting for extremist parties.
The conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: How long will it last?
Those who are in authority are not so bad: why then do they turn away?
A Hard Mind
After they have been treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the shells of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now available free.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which have been filed in Bad Arolsen for a total of 27 km, have not been recorded until now, whether it is with a humanitarian intention, individually and nominally, so on the question of an earlier victim or his or her members.
The eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, have agreed to make them available to researchers and historians in May 2006.
After the ratification process has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
No Information
The access of the historian to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be conducted, in particular on the deportations of prisoners, the concentration camps and the health status of the forced workers, Reto Masters, led by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, have been able to make these nominal documents available to the public, due to the strong nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the spiritual stopping of some deportation victims.
Incentives of the concentration camps or the command of the Gestapo were brought together for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who were deported or subjected to forced labor, and to provide them with evidence of their arrest, if any, to find their way to their destruction.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 fixed personal requests are still being processed today.
However, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing to be expected in these documents, Dr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008.
The trade between India and Europe is already reaching the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the most important trading partner in India and makes 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement 2008.
EU Foreign Ministers had given green light to the European Commission last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the South-East Asian League (Asian).
The EU is the first trading partner in India and makes 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade package will provide the two economic areas with a huge advantage and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million eligible Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products in India, the European Commissioner further explained. Asian and European giants, between the value of EUR 47 billion in value and services in the value of EUR 10 billion, had declared this week Daniel Smadja, President of the European Commission's appointment in New Delhi, and regretted that his potential trade has not yet been exhausted. The EU and India will be present on Friday at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes the promotion to the knowledge and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about the current repeated demand for credit conditions and announced a ten billion-dollar grant with a basic rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to reduce the fears resulting from the conditions of the financial market at the end of the year, and to give the banks a greater knowledge of the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank has the intention of providing a significant part of their savings facilities during the maintenance phase which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it shall be notified.
The Bank further states that in this way, 12.15 GMT 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be brought into circulation on 6 December and until 10 January.
This is probably the first time that the BoE in an open market operation brings liquidity for five weeks in progress.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is prepared to take further steps to obtain from day to day the different interest rates of the interbank loans with its basic rate.
The difference between banks' interest rate was 5,829% on average from day to day.
The trimonium rate has risen to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the sums collected by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties that the banks had refused to take.
In view of some reasons, strengthened by the development of the euro base course, many would prefer to sign for the sums that were incurred by the European Central Bank to benefit from interest rates and with safe discretion.
UMP and NC intend to examine the proposals of the PS for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups of UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the article of the socialist legislative proposal on purchasing power, which is similar to a rejection of the text.
The text produced in the framework of a socialist network (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) included about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PSS on Wednesday, of which the majority of 50% were to be applied for employment, to reintroduction of the TIPP fleet, to a transport check or to rent.
After UMP and NC had voted against the review of the article (180 votes against 115), the meeting was resolved after the main discussion, which partially high exchanges between majority and opposition stand, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television share on purchasing power.
The head of PS Jean Marc Ayroult announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative draft for the reporting of the funds that had been examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival will be born
As a result of numerous complaints about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 presenting, the promoter/producer announces the Vienna Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn Festival.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 shared with Bilboard.com.
C3 features the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival will probably take place on August 8-10 on a 500-acre large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The leader of the Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festival producers.
In 1989 he took the lead in the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which hit 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been involved in production as a partner in the production of licenses and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can take up to 177,500 people in the meantime.
Charlie Jones of C3, described as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been, says his company and Melvin Benn work alongside each other to offer a festival event in European style in the area.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work hard together with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission were motivated and encouraged by this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained involved in political debates with regard to the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
" Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Ben and prepare for a great festival at an extraordinary place that will finally be welcomed by the people."
C3 Presents have developed the Lollapalooza Festival 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago once again after it has been profiled in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the Festival World.
In 2007, the two events amounted to $9.8 million and $11.8 million.
These two festivals take place in the city area.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, although the most vulnerable are on the urban grasslands," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to mix these two concepts together in one way or another in order to communicate at the same time the impression of a rural festival in the European and urban manner."
Vienna is about half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vienna, including the mayor, takes over the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
Finally, it is encouraging to appreciate the conditions of the convention, but it confirms that "they are sufficiently interested in investing in such an event and to hold a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the recording capacity of the festival is "very big" in about 80,000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer delicious rock, but music will be very numerous to attract all kinds of visitors," says Charlie Jones.
His partner of C3, who received the top independent promotion price of the last Ballboard Touring Awards, is Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal's on the terminal.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if there is no lower than the terminal.
These lock tests are part of the delegation tasks.
A political "high-ranking mandate" because of the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who initiates "Runaway Productions".
Is it hard to deal with the Governor?
"I must be careful because it is the industry that decides where it comes from.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are affordable, she will go there.
Our role is to provide those who are best treated," he says.
The run on the festival.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the present cinema has the highest priority at the moment.
The game has begun after the Oscars.
At all festivals at the West Coast, while Sundance, which is from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, is going to present the films from Quebec, evaluate them and ensure that the producers are interviewed.
The dark timer had a successful presentation at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented on the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the plate in Santa Monica and will be presented on the 30th Star of Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films on the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the bear a final year-Rally before? Unanimity with experts due to the US hypothetical crisis
With almost five weeks to the end of the year, the investors are already moving their hands towards the coming end of the year.
However, experts cannot create secure forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that the month of December in the Bourse is normally accompanied by a positive market development
It is not advisable, however, to make forecasts short-term and only on the basis of statistics. In particular, when serious efforts are being made to determine the current market situation.
While other experts do not welcome such a strong rate increase in the last weeks of the year, they also note that the profit rate is determined by the market liquidity and market participants. They invest mainly in interest funds that are significantly affected by the rising trend of assets.
Therefore, according to these experts, there will be a further lateral, price-impacting trend of market fluctuations, especially since we cannot yet assess the extent of the possible decline in the U.S. interest rate, a uncertainty that is mainly due to the rising oil price and the risk of inflation rate increase.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a waiting time to announce a leading market-Rally.
The chances aren't very good, the experts are sure.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its peak on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an intermony analyst, the Ibex 35 could conclude this year with almost 16,000 points on the restructuring of the investment fund and the traditional, each year by this time.
However, the expert points out that this year could develop something different, especially due to the fact that it was already in the second December, and then immediately after the spring of the day of the constitution, which takes place at the end of the year.
According to the analyst, price changes would not affect market religions.
Following an assessment by Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Inversions, the previous assessments of market placing at a close technical level could lead to a difference from the index values, which would at first depend on the impact of the US hypothetical market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values that are required to move the Ibex to a new maximum, the analysers agree.
Solana by Intermoney means this year are the big values on the line.
The expert would count on the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector would be expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from the Bank Investors ensures that the increases are made in connection with the banking and industrial sector.
If the Rally really fits, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS is in the last few months on a discount course, and we hope that other real estate companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will join the same route, as the expert.
With regard to increased consumption during the day of Christmas, the market will be determined in the last half of the year of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two short courses.
At the end of 2003, the technology blassed, led the bears out of their crisis and launched the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 rose to 28.17 percentage points, December showed a rate increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will result in the fifth winning year (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also an end-year rally will be shown.
Populars will open their 200 credit institutions from mountains to free of charge for 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
In total, 200 of these are located in the most economically powerful regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these discounts mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since Popular as the first banking group represents the spring watch to extend the opening times of its branches to 20.30h and set at 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The BBVA Banking Group, which has also repeatedly delayed the extension of its opening times in the Netherlands, has not yet decided on a definitive decision.
The ongoing negotiations between the Bank and the trade unions seem to aim at agreement, with 75% of all branches being closed each day and open for it on a weekly day, even if not for the company.
Whether further banks of the new initiative adapting to business openings will depend on the experience values of the Popular Bank.
And that's the idea that popular pursues with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of the branches, which, because of their position, can be the buyer’s own, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large purchase houses.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 doubles during the next 18 months, as it is not new but modified opening times.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the spaces of the discounts that are already in business zones and match them at the same time the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of opening times is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern, colourless design.
The competent bank representative, Ángel Rivera, ensures that restructuring does not require any greater investment, but is accompanied by an increased staffing, since a branch now needed no more than six, but eight or nine employees.
The discounts that are even equipped with additional space for SMEs will not be sold for financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept and nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience values look positive, so Ángel Rivero.
The downloads of the streets Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a deafer decision.
Popular is currently running around 2500 discounts.
And 60 more who operate under the name of Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, since most of them are offered a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to show any competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telephonica, they have been agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking staff.
The Spanish Private Telecinco doubles its value for the first time and thus exceeds its rival Antena 3.
We made it.
With this sentence, the business leader of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, was able to satisfy his satisfaction at the end of the season. The sender led by him had increased his value to the double of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, touched his joy: That is exactly what hurt me; not that we were a higher growth, but that we had fewer losses, he determined.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not been deeply tired.
Telecinco ended the day with a plus of 2,54% last night.
This profit decreases its previous annual losses by 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value is now reached at EUR 4,488.88 million, with the Mediaset controlling the capital's main share (52%), and Vocento is only participating with 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, with a market value of 2,193,46 million to half.
The market value of other marketed communications companies is high; in the case of Sogecapable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días magazine) in 2,518.53 million and in Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be ruled out by the fact that it deals with two similar companies, so Vasile.
Unbeknownst to me, the question of how much we can actually act in a cost-effective manner, what price and how we can design it at customer level.
Telecinco declared his intention to raise this year to the first television transmitter with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising. This guaranteed Gueseppe Tringali, the business leader of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the company.
If the project should be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, the net interest rate increased by 1.6% in the first nine months (up to 734.4 million), while net rents from the television business were only an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the better flow of telecinco is the analysis of the high payout ratio that the company could be present to date: in 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría launched a 100% dividend insurance.
Vasile, however, ensures that after buying 33% of the shares of Endemol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary even if it is too early for an official notification.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have already given much more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of the endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently facing certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the projected growth rate, which will be reduced from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reflected the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and by 7.5% for 2009.

The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary drafting today, which ended with the decision of the Congress in the Senate on the additional/replacement requests for the project, the Government published the provisions made under the new law with a view to allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of Congress and Senate officials, who had pursued the objective in their negotiations and votes, to establish the best possible arrangement to ensure the safety of investors and to regulate the individual business activities to ensure such a comprehensive and efficient market experience.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which establishes the value-added securities service Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in the protection of investors, the increase in the control requirements of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialized companies as well as natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), consultancy companies, which are associated with the investment and transmission companies of securities.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, thereby adding regulated markets to the multilateral systems of the business and to the systems for the internationalisation of trade contracts, which would end up competing with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms, the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of risk management on the market and all projects carried out to facilitate their control of CMMV.
The Economic Commission for the Congress made further changes in the near future, in which it decided that the debt transfer granted by title should now be regarded as a complex financial instrument by the US hypothetical and banking crisis. (US hypothetical crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal entry into force of the labour sector of diplomatic economic scientists was adopted 30 years after 1977, which was limited to the areas reserved for economic scientists.
The Senate, on the other hand, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic intermediary who works abroad, does not require authorisation from the CNMV and cannot offer its services for the marketing of products and for the acquisition of customers at the same time more investment firms.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) has increased by about five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) which, through the disclosure of data, seeks to compare local and quality with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made provisionally by using the same method as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using different other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistics Act (INE) held that the previously identified indicator should not only serve as a reference value and therefore do not comply with the final outcome announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and Economic and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in GDP in November was a temporary development; at the same time, the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, in the halls of the congress building, Solbes stated that even if the current number is not good, Spain's inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less equal in recent years.
He also explained that in November there were fewer surprises than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced today's public forecast.
Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock revenue of more than EUR 42 billion in the coming three years
The values of Northern Rock have fallen by more than half since the Bank in mid-September of the last year had asked the UK notation bank for an emergency credit, and they are currently only 12 000 million pounds (equivalent to EUR 16,800 million).
At this time, the bank's assets are estimated at 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has been significantly damaged within two and a half months by the loss of confidence of customers, and despite the government's 100% guarantee that money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The company Virginia, which would continue to run the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to enter about a quarter of the UK banks' incomes that will be collected there in the next three years to acquire exactly the 18 billion funds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The multi-billion-year-old Richard Branson, known by his frequent advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, aims to allow 50,000 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) annually to fly in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve his goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, where three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of the insolvency.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for misgivings about participation in urban corruption
Today, the Spanish police have adopted the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) in Murcia, due to the intense suspicion of the development of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the Secretary-Generals of the Community and the head of the Community Police was appointed.
José Martínez Andreo is currently in the office of Juan Morales, currently president of the partyido Popular and then president of the Totana community, and could be based on information from the Cadena SER of the original driver of the complex.
The officials continue to examine the business reports of the Community and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not conclude further proceedings in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was charged with the major suspects in the case of urban corruption discovered early this week.
According to the information provided by Cadena SER , the lawyer of the popular, and therefore privileged rapporteur Juan Morales was determined to leave his mandate on the basis of important binding documents to be associated with the whole.
Other sources of information from the relative payment of Morales are reported to a Galician construction company which provides for the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares of large area was decided.
There are currently eight persons in the research department.
Bono agrees to accept the application of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of a selection page, at the convention.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which will then introduce the list of PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the case of an election of the Socialists, the Office of the President of the Congress.
José Blanco, an organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference, following a meeting with Zapatero at the party's headquarters today.
In the view of the Head of State, the offer has been justified by the former Minister, since it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, the politician coming from Mancha would be calling for a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, as president of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, who announced on November 15th that he would no longer be present at the next general elections to finish his career in public policy and instead to apply himself to the university field for climate protection.
The former Minister had to agree that the President of the Government had been constantly forced to return to the political situation two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for the economy, did not want to prevent citizens from taking over the posts of the President of the Congress in the event of an election, and called it an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, then he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not the exercise or the race to let the citizens appear more like that.
Unfortunately, from time to time, the impression of the only place in Madrid where you can't talk peacefully and let go is the Congress, and the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he congratulated current President Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out that he did not want to have the opportunity to take over the office already, since his political opponents would otherwise call this arrogance.
Climate change
Since the climate debate is subject to unambiguous criticism by both the climate change designers and those who are leading a social and political debate in this regard, the movement must be a strong one at the same time.
In particular, when it comes to a leader of the movement, as in the case of President Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him to the point of saying that he is not a member of his government, which has made it clear that Spain is within the EU at the top of the countries that have met the Kyoto Protocol's standards at least.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance of the objectives to which sectors are to be brought back, and why did his Government, which had proposed the agreement with the planets, not stop this development.
In addition, he has now forced the Spanish citizens to take the measures provided for by him against climate change without any change.
What companies will be affected by the change in the behaviour of citizens, what individual and collective savings measures are required and what economic consequences are involved.
Just tell me who has to sacrifice and will be paid for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and there will be no such statements in the future.
That's because it's about the offer and the payments.
Because the measures that can really be used against climate change are unacceptable.
They are expensive, inefficient and dangerous for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol-cent proposed by the PSOE appeared to Zapatero in a strategic vision so dangerous that he found himself forced to return to the proposal.
Similarly, now it is appropriate to save the planets with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty speeches without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commission, committees, protocols and new bodies.
With his agreements with the planet, the other politicians should not talk about such appropriate campaigns, complain, or demand, but rather follow the demanding issue, make the meetings fun and encourage others with their sanity and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not differ from its pure virtual nature and does not suggest that the road will eventually become the only means of transport, or we can only refresh us with a facsimile.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana, due to a dramatic development in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has established the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor and a hotel entrepreneur for the likely suspicion of urban destruction, took it seriously today.
The city court was established at its residence, from where it was brought to the community office and in its rooms it is still present, surrounded by many agents who were also involved in the urban administration and in the municipal construction of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it appeared that more than 2 million hectares of unclosed buildings should be built for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria. These should be built on the basis of 4000 dwellings after the local administration has reached illegal commissions during the last legislator period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested directly but have been subjected to an investigation procedure, which is carried out by the first Totonas Court.
The first six arrests have been brought before the judge today.
According to the press release, Juan Morales, the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP, will also be exposed.
His exfrau, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current, resident friend in Murcia, is still suspicious.
The president and holder of the Nuaria Group , who was a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, Manuel N.A., was appointed in the municipality of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonura Pablo José M.G., whose company was to be part of Nuaria and was to receive the bribe.
The investigations shall be carried out by the municipal authorities against urban delicitities, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carry out 11 further investigations, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this time, only one person was found in Totana: the owner of a regional known refugee seeker who should have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers in Totana, which was supposed to be built. The aim was to achieve a construction project that would attract the population of the community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking places of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct market sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements in Vigo.

Our Finnish Correspondent explains to us yesterday in the most important Finnish journal, the Helsinki Sanomat, a comment (Finland is at the top of the PISA Study), which refers to the opinion published in the same journal on 18 November; at the same time on that day, its issue included the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the Philosophy Fact has become the subject of the public debate after the tragedy about the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the brutal murder is an abiturant who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsinki Sanomat, the President of the Education Council for the Philosophy Business, Pekka Elo, asked the teachers to take a more critical position on the Platonism and suggest that the Platons be raised from the subsidized teaching plans for the Philosophy to Gymnasian.
We've got three of them.
A colleague informs about the illegal download of Internet downloads in the Criminal Code Book:
A. The download of a member would be a legal breach which would be dealt with in six months.
However, if you start a music business under a value of 400 euros, this will only be a simple mistake (Article 623.1).
B. If you drop the business up to a value of EUR 1000, the stock will, however, fall as a penalty, but the penalty will fall less than in the case of a download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you close a car and return it four hours later, the penalty is still lower than in a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a striker than in a music exchange.
In order to participate in a rebellious detention, a prison sentence shall be three to 12 months after (Article 154 of the Penal Code), while the data exchange shall have an exemption of from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade with copyright-protected films whose authorisation has not been granted by the author is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should have the right, then someone's demands have been very high.

My Hausertzt sends me a long, rare research article with the title: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings arising from the monthly payment are dependent on the content of the colleagues.
The study was produced by a Tomographic-magnetic Reference Analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the Science Journal.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Research Centre Life&Brain, the activation was then the strongest when the participant received the correct answers and his players separated.
Researchers were able to realize that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their answer and then obtained the same amount; but if one of them received the double, it also became a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure if it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Balkans State Council
Carla del Ponte has been in the hands of the Balkan war criminals for eight years. Her office is in the state administration of the former Yugoslav Criminal Court, located in La Haya.
Her mission will run at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a drenched and low eye, as the chief officials of the Srebrenica Massacier - with the hundreds of thousands of Bosnian Muslims coming to live - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian-Bosnic leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the open foot.
Her names are listed on the list of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a proposal for the title of his documentary film La List de Carla (2006, not yet in Spain); a film that, at the time of a political tripler, followed the Swiss state officials from Belgrade to New York for their intention to raise emerging crimes and put the governments under pressure to reduce their nets.
What insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance covering a possible accident caused by the driver includes a high cost-effectiveness, which is again dependent on different factors, including age, sex, time of creation of the driver, family status, type of car and its use, etc.
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the proper vehicle model.
First of all, we have to be clear about what we have to do here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This Agreement shall be signed in writing by means of an insurance agreement, which establishes that the company receives the said insurance premium and is obliged in the event of an accident to submit the corresponding deductions.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance consisting of several factors, including age, sex, time of creation of the driver’s license, family status, type of vehicle or use.
Insurance undertakings shall determine their prices according to statistics, so that, in the event of a higher accident, they will also be subject to higher contributions.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women must pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower incidence of accidents due to their forecast.
The same applies also to married persons, since they are less likely to fall into isolation, as they are said to be of the statistical values, and are subsequently confirmed by companies.
The benefits associated with the vehicle affect the frequency of the vehicle and also the probability of an accident.
You're more likely to use the damage.
When establishing the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs first.
We have now listed the most important points that should be taken into account when choosing insurance in order to meet not only an effective but also a pre-sorientated choice.
The 25-year-olds are faced with the choice of price-friendly insurance on many obstacles, such as low driving practices and young drivers.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance policy to be completed, there are still more valuable alternatives.
The forecast drivers can choose a full casino with self-sustainment so that the services of a full-sale insurance are covered, but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount generated by the damage itself.
The amount shall be fixed before the end of the contract and through the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher than the amount to be paid , says Luis Noguera, Spain's Chief Representative at First Europe, an online insurance undertaking.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures customers against external accidents, but not the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover the loss of fuel, fuel and vehicle.
Here's a Council.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is up to you to reduce your insurance costs; so your subscription will be increased by attempting to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A prescription is a reduction in the basic fee with the relevant insurance company.
On the other hand, a penalty includes a fee charged.
The high rates of fines and penalties depend on the company and its revenues.
If the company has a considerable year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year-old mark is exceeded, it is easier for the driver to conclude a contract. This is why the fact that the accident rate is lower with increasing driving practice.
It is therefore most important to decide for full-scale insurance with self-sustainment.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of the accident, the Spanish president of the European company explains, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the starter's fear has been eliminated.
However, it is advisable for a married customer who does not have children to conclude a full cassette insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
By the insurance company, spouses with children are treated as customers with the lowest accident rate, and thus lower their contributions.
In this case, the best option would be to provide full cash insurance with self-sustainment (with an amount of EUR 300). In the case of a high subscription, an additional insurance is recommended, which is used only for the third year of the vehicle.
They are generally more demanding and possess a greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher payment of their contribution, says Luis Noguera.
For Rentner, it is proposed to conclude a full-scale self-sustainment insurance (at a amount of EUR 150) or an extended insurance which is used only in a high-quality letter.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidents, but also because it generates high costs that require a basic choice that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan on the point for the final
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow are going to fight the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals even before the end of the campaignsleague. Italians need the point to reach the tops of their group while deciding on their participation in the shooting.
The Italian delegation has already had five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an exception in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another way to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not include Befia Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, since the FC Mailand must attend the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will be fought for the first time on the 13th in the semifinals around the final, which will take place on the 16th.
Thus this group will be completed in front of all others and the dissipation in the Gueseppe Meazza Stadium will be the result expected, even if both teams are tried to win. The Italians will not have to speculate at home, namely, the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would have a winning group leader and thus have a better starting position at the end of the final.
The man of Gordon Strachan could even have a lower position at the FC Shakhtar's sleep to qualify. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are equal to the participation; they had lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win the second game (2-0).
This is why the Milaners are going to try to avoid the shots at night. They hope to reach the final end of the round of the filmed champions after they have been hit in the previous game season in exactly the same round by a tower of kaka in the next game time (1-0) and by a zero to zero indistinguishment on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar awaits the victory of the Rossoneri, the man will have to focus on his own game, as both the achievement of the final and his membership in the UEFA depend on his victory and a reduction in the Celtic Glasgow.
Benfia Lisbon, despite its lower position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the greatest European masterdom, could achieve the third place by winning and thus playing with the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the Canadian Vancouver before the eyes of 20,000 spectators of the Committee for their first tour after the release of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Giri Halliwell) shortly before the beginning of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver, the vote in the reunited band was excellent.
In order for 20,000 people to survive the concert at the stage sold, a video about the band’s history, which had provided for the end of the nine-year term for Furore.
The reunification and the world tour are intertwined with the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hit and two more new songs, headlines and voodo, which appears in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold medals that had previously been awarded to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The sporter was among the fans in the audience who led the GM Palace to rejoice, although his wife Victoria's nerves had forbidden him in the previous days.
While preparing for the show Victoria Beckham let the British Star never get to the front of our garden, and that's why I'm already quite tired of what he's going to do with the show.
Sporty Spice, whose exit from the group in 1998 was due to internal differences of opinion two years later the group's resolution came to an end, took her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I wondered why I didn't actually; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm went out to break the band she had hired nine years ago.
The singer also admitted that the conflicts had been eliminated and that they were all again very pleased.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First, the group was introduced to a special machine of the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver after the CTV transmitter's report.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by a gentleman from a child-friendly group.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be held as the next in California, San José (on December 4th) and Los Angeles (on December 5th and December 7th).
In Madrid they will take part in the races on 23 December.
New fears about the global gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) will be managed by Ukraine and each conflict between the two nations will be closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the gas, it will take account of Russia's higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two countries has reduced supply in the EU countries in the last year.
The most recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state-owned gas monopol gasprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to calculate more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional to Earth gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in conversations," said Ukrainian economic minister Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing earthly gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transitional taxes [after Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major global gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies in Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which drove prices dramatically to the height.
Russian gas is a fourth of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas pipelines, but many of them remain underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own equipment with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries.
NHS "Check Foreign Workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the control of the pre-trial registers for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in contact with the approach to the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service does not have any specific suggestions regarding the number of foreign employees.
However, his report showed that other important controls were properly carried out by five health authorities.
The chief financial controller examined staff recruited outside the European Economic Area, following the approach to the airport of Glasgov.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a land car was driven through the main airport terminal doors.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October in the Old Bailey, and was charged in connection with the required auto bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service shall carry out checks prior to the establishment of foreign staff to ensure that they possess the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities Disclosure Scotland uses to review pre-trial records, the Agency does not have to obtain these information on the competence of the Agency outside the UK.
The main test report now contains other recommendations that the Board of Directors should draw up guidelines for the tax exemption scheme to assist workers in checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some personal documents, these have not been routinely carried out," the report said.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines in advance of the establishment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Schottland president Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the event of the establishment of potential NHS employees would identify people who might be involved in future terrorist attacks.
"In the report it means that the current NHS Scotland's preptest works well and it's not clear what multiple value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1.161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, even because the main problems had to be identified by the employees who were allowed to work at an uncertain time.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanrkshire, and Lothaan were substantially maintained.
These include passports, work permits, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently examining its policies and guidelines for control of foreign staff in the NHS prior to start-up.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I had a duty to carry out this work in the light of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines regarding control investigations in the event of the appointment of all staff members - including those from abroad - will be re-scanned next month.
Joy Division Dominant Film Award
Control, the film biography over the late Joy Division Singer Ian Curtis has hidden five prizes at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.
Prices were also paid to major producer Sam Riley, who worked in a store house before he was paid for the role of the Curtis, Director Anton Corbin, and Deputy Director Toby Kebell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded as the best major manufacturer for the Thriller Notes on a scandal.
And Bond founder Daniel Craig won the variety prize for turning the British film into the world's public.
The prices were transferred to a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis up to space with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 with 23 years.
The Black White film - on its audiotrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Orders - was directed for only 3 million British pounds.
However, he has introduced the Dutch photographer Corbin, who has previously been known for the cultural cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two prizes - as the best director and the best director.
Rockmusic was the middle of another prize winner at the ceremony - as Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer came the price for the best documentary film.
The price for the best dealer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian Mafia boss in David Cronenbergs in London playing Triller Easter Promises.
Ray Winston, who is in the race to play hard core, has paid Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently filmes Indiana Jones The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the price that was named after the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney, who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I had the pleasure of meeting Richard Harris a few times.
He's my kind of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really scared."
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group, belonging to the filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia due to a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia has discovered yesterday that 208 million people have been arrested for their involvement in cells that had planned an earlier attack on an oil plant, as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest exporter of oil said one of the cells had planned to freeze rockets.
Sympathetics from Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been a United States connector since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight million people, inspired by a foreign citizen, was planning an approach to an oil plant in the eastern province, following the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 strong fast-injection team to protect Al Quaida from the world's largest oil treatment plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the prisoners belonged to a cell led by a "racet expert" who was illegally deported to the country.
He reports that the militia had planned to launch eight projects in the Kingdom.
More than 22 of the inmates had followed up the report to deliver spiritual and security powers.
The government has warned of further efforts to stop Saudis who are trying to unite with Al Qaida militias, who want to fight the Allied War Forces and the US-supported Muslim government, which is considered by the Hardliners under the sun.
Al Qaida Milizen viewed many spiritual people in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by the attacks of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaida Führer, born in Saudi Arabia, targeted the provincial Saudi government - have looked at foreign housing, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last five months," a speaker from the Ministry of Internal Affairs shared the public television.
The arrests also involve a "medium cell" of 16 from Medina, which was intended to acquire the "Takfiri Think" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which is being burned as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the prisoners, 32 people were also charged with providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on the Venus could give an insight into the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft located on a trajectory show that the planet is still more like a decomposition of the earth than it has ever known.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planets, but the Venus of the sun is something closer.
Thousands of years ago, Venus had ruled on conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabited, scientists believe today.
However, due to the uninterrupted carbon dioxide tribulating effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotational stamp, Venus introduced a completely different development course.
Today the planet is cooled by water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is powered by hurricane-strong winds and lightning waves.
The findings of the Venus Express Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, offer a satisfactory view of how the Earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It will be clear why the climate on Venus is so different from what the Earth is, while the planets are rather relatively similar."
"Our new data enables us to build a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago as the Earth, perhaps with a viable environment."
"Angelichert Uran" attacked by the police
A Kilo radioactive material, reported to have been seized by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police speaker said three people were arrested and that the material was checked.
He did not confirm whether it was a valued uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (48,000).
Already open
When Romey said he didn't want a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency was finally ready to set up a debate on YouTube, to pick up questions on the normal electoral question on video, and to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the Democrats were asking about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party, which appeared in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly as the CNN producers who supported the debate with the selected YouTube Clips to show the current candidates.
However, in the first half of the debate, which was the longest to be devoted to a single topic, immigration was at the centre.
The theme is one of the most powerful subjects for the Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of different voters to serve a choice when they heard things that were missing them: the television station marked the tops of the consent as the candidates spoke strictly about the boundaries.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national president, and Romney, who had taken the lead in the decisive questions in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to block the call, had he been allegedly illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney, in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts, of imprisoning illegal immigrants for work at his house.
In particular, the two asked each other whether one of the candidates would support an "Amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More important candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to review this subject.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but both remain on the race, perhaps because they have gone earlier and older than others on the immigration pay.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same views: harsh borders, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This theme, together with a host of toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinks should be considered a folder.
One of the teachers asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s reasoning that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe the history of Jonah and the wall in Scripture.
Another questionnaire asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressure was exerted on whether Jesus would punish them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too smart to hire a political office.
The race remains extremely open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Pauls' latest customers and his triumphal voices in the midweek debate.
These two are not high enough because the two flights of the party have not yet been able to meet one of the known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate launched the party from the beginning and was convinced of a successful message about the size of America and a winner of both the party's flights.
This time the party is split and the result is not yet clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another group of incidents; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly sedentary.
No adel title seems to be sold, no Parisian hotel bills are paid, no extra lines are paid.
But the discovery that a rich businessman spent more than 650,000 dollars (1.3 million dollars) over four years on behalf of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without the fighter Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the president of the Minister withdrew his request for a choice, in a dramatic way causing the intelligence of the British, claiming that questions had not affected this decision, he hoped that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, who, to an increasing extent, the representative president of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, has developed the first-hand Brown of Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unencumbered rescue of Northern Rock, a related bank, showed regulatory weaknesses and poor judgment powers under decision.
Unfortunately, proposals to amend the tax legislation have brought undertakings against the government.
The tax government loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unforeseeable administrative pfuscheries.
A trio of generals in peace began a protest in the upper house against cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the War Forces, they claimed to be part-time jobs.
Now there are the numerous contributions of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of Labor (and her former executive director) has already returned.
It doesn't mean Brown's unsurpassed direction of departure.
However, governments can achieve a turning point after which they feel unable to control it.
Nor do reliable politicians like to be trusted, but they usually keep their fate back when a new troops arrive at the office.
If once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not need to be there for a long time, it is over: the public service begins to be forgotten; the cabinet ministers start to complain; the press are looking for bad news; and the government will be defensive and vulnerable.
In a way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because he cannot be a new bet against other political leaders.
So if he wanted to lie to Tony Blair, he was his superior.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax authorities, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown has faced as a Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's miss message - as in the long "Gold for Addelstyle" investigation of political party funding - the voters may conclude that he was.
Nevertheless, Brown's position is not as bad as it looks.
The pledges are not as bad as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, or was finally rushed.
And the remedy, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns have always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new witness on political spending is a good example.
The noble Abraham, who compares his donations with his common gifts, does not wish to say a public recognition for his favor.
This may be so, but the decision did not stop him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
What he said was aware of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, it will naturally have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, chief financial operator, who was told about the special expenses in October.
However, Brown is not involved: there is no indication that he was aware of these objections, although the majority of the payments were made after his arrest in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half the work.
He was quick to condemn the violation of the law by his party, but he corrected this resolve by taking a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to complete the measure by a bishop in peace and a judge.
In this case, the "inviting lessons" are not very complicated.
When the law was violated, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unemployed for six months, and making progress with an ongoing reform of political party funding.
This would require cooperation with the conservatives from the hardline of the lab and, if possible, the special financial relationship with the trade unions - more calls for a partner like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the issues of opinion; they have two years to get back to voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through inapplicable legal capacity and solid competence.
Cards
Does the U.S. credit crisis hit the credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that back fluids rise up again.
Now that America's real estate market is broken down, the rabbis have the country's credit card market in the visitor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs estimate that the loss of credit cards could amount to $99 billion if the risk of borrowing from sub-funded credit increases in other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the savings and in the household rates which measure the proportion of the credit which are not unique or beyond 30 days.
The HSBC has announced in the last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion tax deduction from its American consumer funding, partly due to the lack of credit card holders.
It's too early to fall into panic.
Losses and seeds are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter of the population rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage of the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained partly by technical factors.
An amendment to the US Private Solvency Law in 2005 resulted in an interruption of competition notifications that would again result in a large part of the loss of credit cards; the number of registrations (and this would result in seed tax) would increase whether or not the general conditions for creditors were worse.
The industry also reports of sound payment rates showing how much of its debt is paid to consumers every month
and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong despite the position in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the Tower Group, a research company, calculates that the expenditure for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certain: it is more likely that consumers will bear credit card debts, now that own credit will be destroyed.
However, the map manufacturers are looking at the cash flow instead of capital values, so the underlying prices do not necessarily result in a change in the credit worth of the creditor.
You can even be a benefit to the card manufacturer.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay the mortgage rates fall if the real estates are less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts are more important under the refund priorities.
Cartoon manufacturers can also respond much faster and more flexiblely to the harsh conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid reassessment of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and fully reassess the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones chief financial rapporteur.
Even if a sudden disclosure crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are very real.
If the US's lower home prices and a credit reduction are forced into the recession, the industry will no doubt face a worse future.
They continued to look after these haific flowers.
British banks are known guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who should be brought before the court for their role in the corrupt system with the former chief financial leader of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally spent seven cases of meetings using telecommunications means for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial envelope in 2000 to save themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was applied on January.
But during an hearing before the U.S. District Court, Ewing Werlein Junior was responsible for a case of fraud using telecoms.
The three former management forces of Greenwich NatWest, one of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during the two years of delivery.
In the United States, its case is a free end to an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original charges against them were made in 2002 by Fastow to note that he was the aim of the government's investigation in relation to the Enron Downergance.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claimed that they had come to Houston in 2000 to investigate a suspicious plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest invested in a subsidiary company of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of numerous anti-fraud enron companies that have contributed to raising the company in the competition dispute.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had valued its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it had a significant value in fact.
A company under copper control purchased the bank’s share of the subsidiary for $1 million.
Bankiers paid a coupon of $250,000 for the company's participation.
According to the complaint, Fastow reportedly claims against Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its share in the subsidiary.
But actually, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, buyers and others dropped about 12.3 million dollars, according to the complaint.
In January 2004, Fastow was found guilty of a violation of his role in the Enrons Pleite in two counts.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prison sentence in the prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has been sentenced to three years and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot on the basis of a $1 million charge, which made it necessary for them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest company of the nation, broke up in the competition in December 2001, was no longer able to profit from the billions of debt or weak businesses after years of accounting tricks.
The collapse has destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former president Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced to their roles in connection with the Enron merger last year.
Skilling is a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays judgements for fraud, fraud and other complaints were not valid after his death in the last year because of heart disease.
Not all down in Moscow
The price of a car of the brand Golfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough wealth to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's small for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulf Stream Station on the last Friday at the Million Exhibition, a four-day agency dedicated to the sighting of the consumer, which was held at a scattered exhibition centre in the city centre.
In addition to the Gulf Stream, more than 200 other luxury exhibitions were built, hoping to attract newly arrived Russians to money, all of them from Mahohoni-tapped yachts to diamond-backed cars suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a bright orange porsche at the next exhibition in the audience.
"It's a nice car, but it's small compared to us," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
The Russian capital seems to be moving with money like Dallas to his glasses.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s as some Americans came to giant wealth and went to Europe, where they were regarded as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab survivors of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are the most visible free of charge in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in gold.
In Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnaul, the president of LVMH, was invited to exchange ideas on how to sell high-cost goods on markets like Russia.
(The Conference is organised by The International Herald Tribunal, which is the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, totaling 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private property in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert degree here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived below the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London juwelier.
She had first visited the show with the Russian trader of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worthy of honor."
As they take Sunday night clothes through the halls, two real estate makers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I got behind the car and tried to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, as a Roter-Tepich Veteran with Joan Rivers.
The exhibition appeared first to focus on the novels, the type of brand- conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stay in the apartment for several hours to visit a suitable store house, the tasteless Cadillac Escalades, pocket meters from platinum, Mövenpick Eisrem, measuring billiards, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybaren.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, the patriotist at a exhibition of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a walled imitation of a Rembrandt image from handmade, blue Mosaic stone.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climate climates."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of subsequent brands with limited number of pieces that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millions, sent by millions or simply tourists, were forced every day through the halls.
And some of them bought it.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, had sold two 70,000 dollars of matrices, made from silk, Kashmir and cotton, with fine gold fields.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, offered a company the High End Autos with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the green orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapted the luxury to customers, would have sold three car coolers for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which is equal to the combined chain armour of 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter an author who was developed for a Russian casino owner with stores that he had passed with colourful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletted.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-year-old.
"The Russian millionaire, the stripper or a picture of his wife's face from a Cuban zirconium will not drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40 cars garage."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karpetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not currently express a lot of exclusion in view of the increase in this real estate price.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they may already be millionaires, at least on the paper if not already in Bargeld," he said.
"There's more than you think."
Those who were not able to do at least as if they were rich at a position run by Alliance Continental, a Russian resource management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were completely suspended with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had published 500,000 incorrect bank notes for the millionaires.
Passants wanted to get the money back, mobile phones, while they returned in the middle of the exchange rate, let them cut off their friends, or simply sign a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Abandoned operation prevented when death occurred in New Jersey
It was the day before the Erndedanskfest as Ronald Livingston through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthy Restaurants here and watched as a hospital car was held at the white Cape Cod two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
When it happened, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the boxcar of the medical nurse," said Livingston, a restaurant overseer, in the middle of the night.
"That was the point I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Agency.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether they died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house at the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs Arroyos' death, and they hope that toxicological studies that could not be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant of the Police Director, Gary F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice has been widely known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-hearted," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"It was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a female nurse.
Eilene Walsh, a speaker for the Union Council of County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house about 3 o'clock in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared before death.
More than a week has passed, and the authorities have informed little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is presented as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a beautiful rose stream is in the close front of the house and a Dalmatian is called behind the house.
A blue fass is described as "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for Vanille in food and perfumes - in the park area along with a door that led to a fall.
Two mountain bikes hang from hacking on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find a decent and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to watch this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce the interest will lead to the increase in the world market
The shares appeared yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, following market openings that the central bank will try to slow down the credit markets by further benchmarks, with disturbing comments from the vice-presidents of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rise in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank's president, said that the policy should be "flexible and pragmatic" on the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to slow down misleading markets, in view of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn, who were the youngest turbulences, said that "partly some of the improvements in market functions had changed from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence remained, it would increase the possibility of further deterioration of the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were received by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step up and to stabilize the credit conditions with new capital prices in the US markets and possible other advantages.
The executions also helped slow down the Wall Street, in view of further bad news from the US economy, as the US real estate sales reached a new record rate in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will have 650 jobs, or 4% of their world workers, in a cost reduction measure to offset severe losses from their lost assets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will be lost in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index is 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S&P 500 index has increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased to 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
The resale of credit pressure on the markets was previously subsidised after a strong demand for an auction of trimonates guarantees from the European Central Bank, which was granted to the European trading banks, to a significant 4.7 per cent, the highest Council since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to invest other capital resources in the monetary markets in London increased as the credit savings increased the three-month "Libor" rates to rent between UK banks by 6.59 per cent on its peak since late September, following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronts the decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two Dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other one.
Who is to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, at least under this special title, is here to decide to help the Chief Chief of Staff Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan, and because the board of High Morries, the English business manager, is generally filled with applications for national voters, if not even for any part of the time.
Anyone who does not always get the sixth hiter position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sports is undoubtedly.
It's never easy to figure out exactly what makes a person reach the tops of his profession, while someone else never gets out of the lowest rank, sometimes because of a lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not just in the cricket where the choice is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Whether to raise the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area if, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leadership forces with good conclusions that are well known to the business.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, whether it will give him the opportunity to swim or fall down.
Of course, numbers have a major impact on decisions, but these also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must get the attention of the captain at the right time if he can take a wicket and a sleeker must get regular opportunities on the order if he wants to make a daily cricket player impression.
The eyes of the selection are more complicated.
There were many more people in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to be playing in the first test, even when Stephen Harmison explained himself for health and how the wind ran into the net.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with every 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same measured average, but both had their highlights and hoped for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in Asgiria Stadium can be just a visual question.
The choice could determine the careers of both men, or it might make a little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five weeks and 40 useful runs, however, it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to establish himself, who created the break into a significant test cracker and who, although he had a double hundred points against Australia, may still be appreciated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following a further discussion of the current web site at Asgiria Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and feelings for Shah's greater experience with Boparas youth entertainment.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks of his working and valuable 88 Test Debt Ints in Bombay, 43 first-class hundred and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against trained horses.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two interns in May against West Indies in the Lord, his home theater as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan, was healthy in order to regain his position for the next game, seems to have taken the sweat out of his wounds, which was still open in Bombay.
On the contrary, all children from Essex have a fun life.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket platform and his attitude was taken away from it when he had recently transferred a four-wheeled vehicle into an exhibition for England's Sponsor Volkswagen.
He experienced minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (of course also posted) out and call his teammates Alastair Cook, who had observed it from the distance, and said excitedly, "Have you seen it?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he repeats his medium time with some effect here on the playing fields, what seems to fit him and hits him with confidence and message.
The right man to choose is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
I refuse to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be well-informed, but if, as the Teexa from Ceylon suggests, he is the one that will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of shipments of money or visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had expelled them from their homes.
In Mansour's bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government van by a dozen buses, the terminal was working with refugees from Syria and Jordan who were returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw in the television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, in relation to the soldiers of the militant Clerk Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces back to the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old skitish teacher from the dominant Sunni part of Amariah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraq was not allowed to work.
His Swiss neighbors in Amariah called him to tell him that a local, supported by the United States, had helped him to expel Al-Qaida from her base in the west of the capital, and sent him back.
One of Jordan's newborns was the leader of a Sunni and Schitish tribes who had been expelled from his home in Sleek, north of Baghdad by an attack with handshake after calling on his citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was back to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaida militia in Slekh and that they needed my support and my boys.
That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been caught by the increasing peace in the capital since the US-group increase and the growth of local "citizens affected" groups, which were armed and protected in cooperation with the American military.
But more talk about being forced to go home through visa problems and financial resources in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exileants that Nouri al-Maliki, the Swiss Prime Minister, who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went on to visit Syria well until al-Maliki and the government no longer forced the Iraqis to give a visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni Renter.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline of violence is that sunnits were disbanded from skitish areas and turned around, which led to the creation of many places where tensions followed.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will resuscitate sequential tensions and bring them into conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest Federal Republic of Germany is leading in vocational training and is even aligned with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the Saarland countries stress the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've been telling a non-State country yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan puts the smallest Germans on their 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in Saarland's education system, which is located in the educational monitor of the German Institute of Economy (IW).
The schools are already working closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their study here with a double or even triple degree.
Similarly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
However, the country's children also bring Saarland to the upper secondary schools - many of them without an end to Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, educational expert at IW.
More than every five young people earn their studies at a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are likewise strongly developed.
Compared to the population, the equipment with double studies is the second largest in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineers employed in the past years has declined to a third.
As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineers.
"In the general education schools, after the first Pisa study, we have experienced various reforms," says a speecher of the Ministry of Education.
So the government carried out a country-wide comparison test.
In order to teach children early, the last Kitai year is free of charge - a model that is also copying among other federal countries.
Whether the performance of the students improves continuously, future comparative studies will only be shown.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students dropped from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, the Saarland was not as strong as other Federal countries.
The Bayerns do better.
As far as the Saarland is concerned, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - there may be other points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbours is a duty to Gymnasian - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks are first marked differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to return to the South American country for a half hour.
In Spain, Chávez is then referred to as the white figure.
As the Venezuela branch announced, a new law will then set the clocks on the world time less than four and a half hours.
In this way, the South American state has a time zone that is not in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez based his decision, inter alia, that the United States of the world would have set aside full hours in time zones.
In addition, on Wednesday (Order time) Chavez announced the breaking of relations with the neighboring country of Colombia because of a gesaliffer.
The left-nationalist said that while the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remained, he will not remain the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it alone because of my will," said Chávez, who proposes a constitutional reform that must vote on the citizens of the Oulland on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly develop his power in the country.
The resolve of the party was to withdraw the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, where it went to release the hostages.
Uribe has been criticised by Venezuela with his decision "in the face," Chávez criticized Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is in all languages.
A new phone-Klingelton provides in the country for Furore: "Por que no te Callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth) the bag that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
Speaking to him, Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was born on the youngest Ibero-American summit of the permanent interlocutors of the left-wing police force, was on his way over his mouth.
German Dracht 2007 Lohnminus
Despite the strong conjuncturing, German workers were expected to lose a real wage this year.
Experts used a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could actually count less on the cash account than in the previous year.
"This is due to the apparent wage development, the increase in VAT and prices in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjunctive Research of the "Image" Zeitung.
New burdens could also be incurred in the unemployment insurance of workers.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker News," the planned decline in unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the current situation is correct and profitable.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not be allowed to ask for credit or claims when it has to be asked. The SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products was the highest rate of inflation for 13 years.
The prices rise by 3.0 per cent in the year as a whole.
Venus is the Holleric Zwilling of the Earth
The Venus, despite its life-threatening atmosphere of the earth, has been thought to be similar: the European Space Area "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and windwirble to the Poles, as it appeared in the winter.
For almost three decades scientists have been convinced that it will be on Venus.
Now the European song "Venus Express" has brought back the evidence - she shot electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The eyes on the Venus shot at a height of about 56 kilometers from Wolke to Wolke, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine " Nature".
According to the famous "suppen theory", lightnings have created life on earth: winters should have arranged in the ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the construction of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today it should hardly give a living thing on the surface of the Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on the earth, it dominates between temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's waving of the earth, but it's a dwilling," said Russell.
Why the Venus, which is similar to the earth in size and size, has brought about such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since since the beginning of the 19th century, no sin has been on its own to explore these planets.
The latest research results now presented in several "natural" articles stress not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system but also the uniqueness of the solar system.
"They also show that the communities of our neighbouring planet with the earth are larger than the first ones," the Esa shares.
In addition to the well-known wind at Nordpol, the researchers also found a cloudstorm on the south pole, which is still much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the Irish winter hemisphere, writes a research team on Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is nearly as large as a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as morning or evening stars, is within nearly 225 days around the sun.
But he is much slower about himself: One Friday lasts 243 days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar is hardly reminiscent of the earth, scientists conclude that both planets have been created under similar conditions.
On both sides, water, which remained on the earth in the oceans, was lost on the Venus, but lost in the outer space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the ground in carbon dioxide, it makes up most of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Köhler protects brands meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler wants an end to the party's competition for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for his attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the view of Germany and has called for the great coalition to end the struggle to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outside world with this question to any nation united," Köhler said the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signaled an understanding of the acceptance of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even though I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to be sensitive to foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but he took Markel in front of the project, and they took a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not withdrawn from traditional Chinese policy.
It also knows China," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly acknowledged the receipt of the Dalai Lama and was therefore affected by the Union.
Stonemeier, including the Union's "Schauster Policy" in foreign policy.
Following the receipt of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor, there was too much irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only issued the German Minister for Finance Per Steinbrück (SPD), but also introduced the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministers in both countries.
Head of China Government Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China recalls that when European politicians officially received the religious leaders of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The words and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he tried, Tibetan and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, to break off from China.
Scattered in front of Krawals like in France
Road wounds with the police, guns, burning cars: Wolfgang Schöuble is warned against Krawalls like in France.
It was necessary to do everything to prevent social discontent in Germany from becoming violent on the road, the Federal Minister asked.
Barkades burned, Randalllers shot with scraps on the police: After the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development.
"We must be careful not to build up social explosives and resort to violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person is entitled to the rapid change in social reality.
The feds, countries and communities already worked with pressure to create problems, said Schöubble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, this is already the first success."
However, it would be too early for the alarm.
Schüüble also pointed out that in German cities there are no urban and sociological problems such as in France.
In the north front of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street wounds with the police during the last few nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
In Germany, the President of the Turkish Community, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In view of the Krawalle in France, Kolat warned against "next effects".
However, the situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat points out that the unemployment rate for young people with a migration background is "over-averagely high" in 25 years.
In particular, more training should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France, "a social control is taking place in the families".
Moreover, many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But yet we have to adjust."
You must give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training as soon as possible.
At night, however, it remained very quiet in the Parisian front of Williers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a Hubschruber overflew the area with Scheinwerfern.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning molluscs and cars.
Since the morning, an offer of about 1000 security forces has been provided for peace.
The police will proceed as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the city.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured in Krawallen in Williers-le-Bel.
As a result, the sleep on toulouse is over.
The Krawals were in a traffic accident when two young people came to life on Sunday.
The police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The fact-finding attitude of the Chancellor shows that the coalition is content at the end - and that it is no longer expected by itself.
In which country does this federal Chancellor actually live?
After her unbelievably speech in the general debate on the day of the Bundestag, which was hot and inhalable, you must say: not here - not in the country that you finally had to rule.
The idea that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel has referred back to a very serious sentence.
That was provincial, she said and showed that she didn't want to understand why the critics were going.
On Friday, she has documented for everyone's recognition how much they have access to their draft.
There was no concrete interest in the country, nor was there any sense of feeling about the problems.
On the contrary, Angela Wolke presented himself: a retired politician who fled to foreign policy and remained there even in danger.
For example, climate protection: It commends itself to the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in these countries.
It is assumed that the self-sustainment - so much uncertainty had failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she's stuck in the bottle that wakes up in people.
So she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of beautiful the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a barrier.
Children's Arms and the concerns of the underprivileged?
She's got a few extra notes for it.
It is marked as often as she promises when it comes to child rearing.
Three steps need Merkel there to get a half-pound set out.
She's proud like a foreign terrain when it comes to concrete.
_Other Organiser
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Met Romney, are delivering a hard exchange - and now they need to be afraid of external candidates.
The promotion of candidates is already on the first topic.
He has made New York a "influence place for illegal immigrants", and in the middle of Romney, his rival Rudy Giuliani presents himself.
On the other hand, this account with serious prejudices: "I would say that his own house was an illegal port," said Giuliani, and asked the former governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants without paper.
The candidates vote for the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear preferences, the eight presidential speakers use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-run 30 seconds videos that Internet users have posted via YouTube are almost more than a worder.
"With this sort of isolationism we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain suggests his opponent Ron Paul, who asks for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq as the only one in the round.
Romany is also able to read the Leviticals from the Vietnam Veterans when he refuses to judge the so-called "waterboarding" by a method of hearing that is simulated by the cracks to be punished as a result.
However, that the main topics of the campaign are between Iraq's war and folklore, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
If conservative values are always awarded and future tax increases are paid, the auditor's audit will be set up.
It shows again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I've called myself at the time," says Romney, "seriously, and before the base and television audience, that he was still a member of the motivations for the withdrawal in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani comes to Schlinger when he is asked to explain the Bible in his opinion.
Musharraf first reigns in Civil
One day after his return as the army chief, the Pakistani Chief Mahthaber Musharraf was elected President.
To end eight years of military leadership in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was appointed on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistani TV broadcasts the ceremony in the Presidential Palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf has to pay attention to the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he had handed over his office as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus suffered international pressure especially from the United States.
Eight years after his conquest in a bloodless military coup, the former General now reigns for the first time as a civil chief.
With his return as chief commander of the War Force, Musharraf had met a core requirement of opposition and of the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the exceptional situation that the Musharraf had joined on 3 November.
Soon after his announcement, Musharraf, according to General State Law Malik Muhammad Qayum, will rise to the exclusion situation and thereby meet another demand for the West.
In the past week, the Supreme Court of the State, which had held the Musharraf after the accession of the state of emergency in November with him, had condemned all charges against the retrial of the Head of State on 6 October.
In addition, five soldiers were killed and four more were killed in the Northern Hemisphere.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Krauttuck Return
Germany's Supergroup of Sevenziger again musics: The three band members of Harmonia replayed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For Revival, there appears a middle of its great time "Live 1974".
Already, they were much more famous abroad.
The recommended sensation then fits into the table in Gestalt three seats.
Everyone has his pockets in front of himself, his cable and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius breaks in the white hemd with 63 years in the middle.
Links framed by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, from the audience, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone's wearing noises, but even a beat.
And sometimes it adds to a typical piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the rulers themselves.
The band harmonia resuscitated, provided some surprises under Krautrock lovers.
Where you can fill in here: Targeted questions indicated that the name was difficult through collective pop memory, but not so persistent to lose this band for 32 years.
But why should not the Germans also celebrate their living legends from the seventies?
As long as what is called unrefined Krauttrick, in England and America, it is becoming more and more like in its own country.
When the music industry lost the echo price for the lifework of the Kölner Group Can 2003, it saw in the hall a questioned German popviewer.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked themselves in Laudatio even at La Düsseldorf and New! bands, the surprise was not limited.
At the concert, Michael Rother later jumped at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old team.
The problem of ignorance here and the declaration in the enemy is one.
That is why the memory has already been challenged with harmony, because the trio has only existed for two years and at this time also has a much lower effect than was assigned to them overnight by others.
Moebius and Rodelyus had already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler before under the many promising name cluster.
First you played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label contained by the church.
Rother had recently assisted in powerwork and subsequently played a call as guitarist at New!, which at that time might have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in Exil to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the old Weserhof, a ruins of the 16th century, they lived as urban communists.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Rodelius was still suffering as a child.
It's a great artist's daisy.
It appears that in the sperrmül, there was also a vampire of the song fair Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some have stopped harmonia from doing this.
The first album was called "Music by Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Because the music is so relaxed and the music also sounds, the band's little material need.
The collection of travel was not the only thing to do.
The currently released CD "Live 1974" was mixed up in a concert in Greece, before a nearly 50-pound record clip, how someone thinks to think.
That was when Rother came to force the harmony and to exercise on occasion.
For Roedelius and Moebius an unsolicited demand.
The band explained their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Spherical and ensured his existence with albums as "flamming hearts".
Cluster was re-lived in the eights and is even more successful than it was Harmonia.
The Grisser Live album is to thank Herbert Grönemeyer.
This platform company Greenland has set its goal to provide the Krautrock as an unclean German contribution to live music.
New! It has already been buried like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical restoration of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidized, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Love Parade Erfinder Dr. Motte.
With which the entire band width of the chroutock's influence on the next pop music would be affected.
Harmonia is filled with the teaching of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno shifts with the most outstanding sound in the hall: "The only true music you hear is the future."
There are pictures showing the producers with harmony in the farm.
The construction of the legend includes projections of other black-white photographs of the devices we've built.
The three vectors are once again included with improvisation.
Not anymore, by putting microphones on the organ and weapon, to unlock the instruments over self-assessed powered tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into a technically hidden tuffler.
Nor does the chor of the house change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, the sound waves are heated and washed and painted in a beautiful place with the "Aaaaaaah!" emphasis.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It wasn't about Rock.
The roots were found less in the blue than in music schools (Can), technologies (graffitiwork) or on flight to artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" has not been entirely wrong, and harmonia can't get out of it right now.
Still, the self-consistency is fundamentally overemphasized at the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
This can protect one of the nerves or flying moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not ethnic enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Musterary Peace", two films are again dealing with the Balkan war.
But they both don't believe it.
Either the concepts are too much on action and gambling or they are too ridiculous.
There's also Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party".
The good news is first: although the war crimes of Karadzic and Mladic are still hidden in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the southern part of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eight-year-old, since too many net-interested roles in welfare films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism were the fun of ideas.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the Jägers are to be defeated" (Why should film title today always be as long as we are as Lokführer's fares?) may be seen.
He gives a wonderful presentation: On the basis of his war reporter Simon Hunt, what could have been done if the skilful hall and the filmmbarache were not so good: a man who has had his best time behind, but who has kept himself as a terrible reminder of his fall still a significant remnant of the single charm.
But despite this storm, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mortderic Peace", which also begins this week, only the final series of disbanded Balkan war movies continues.
With "Musterary Peace" you can make a short process: the film is made by two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovo's heck protection, which is still in love.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are never represented here as the only root of all waves, the TV film loses itself very quickly in gambling and action.
There remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a car, but for this, war.
On the other hand, the "The Hunting Party" can just look for a copy of why it has not yet given a really good Balkan war film.
The history of three U.S. war reporters who are trying to overcome the Serbian supercomputer "the Fuchs" would have been able to become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another driver (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories seem to be a bit touching: both models go small teams into the forest to accomplish something that the soldiers can't and both times it's going to be a journey in the jungle.
One of the reasons for the skiing of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the sinker with his heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to identify him above him another romantic deal with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down to the ground when the reporters in the last five minutes of the timer procedure have lost what Nato, CIA and all the world's chief warriors have not been able to achieve in five years: the war criminals and the Muslim Bosnians have been caught up in the right race.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a lot of human affairs.
He wants to point out that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to run, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they should be extremely few) to be persecuted because of secret political talks.
But the good community and the bad are sometimes so similar that a famous marriage feast comes into mind.
This is about the wood mask of an Asian demon on the roof's workpiece: "I feel sorry to see the squeaked strangers: as hard as it is to be."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly as much shwell hats as they do, but it's hard to be good.
The problem is not limited to the generation of the Balkan war film.
Recently it has been reported in this newspaper that all Iraqi films Hollywoods were large flops.
You can add: It has not yet given a good South Africa film.
It's almost always true: If a star moves back on the world's crisis or mines fields, then something comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Archette, "All borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all conflicts will be too close at this time.
It had to take decades before Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the Holocaust.
A few films are still being filmed - the Vietnam works currently in use as a classic "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have never been celebrated as masters.
But maybe today we know where each mass murder actually comes home at the same two screens, too, just too much about the world's conflicts.
And that brings to the writer's mind the uncertainty that it takes to tell good stories.
"His or not" or "the great dictator" have also become so good, because Lubish and Chaplin have not yet known how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the very far-reaching artistic view of Romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Wordbook" and the Balkan war, he replied, "This is just because some things never change.
Most cities will always be extremely dangerous, people will always be killed in a cruel manner and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
From Beust wet criticism for Olympic Absage
The rejection of the mayor of Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games was based on strong criticism of politics and economy.
Many still want to fight for the games on the water.
However, realism comes from virtue when assessing the chances.
The main business leader of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, referred to a list on Wednesday as "not good for the economic situation".
No other project has ever produced such great motivations in the city as the Olympics in recent times.
"Without this goal, the sport political movement would not be able to maintain the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the Senate not to finish the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "he's out of a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole of Beust remained on Wednesday at the time of previous announcements that the Olympics of Hamburg were not realistic until 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on an Olympic bid, but on the German Olympic Sports Bond," said Beust WELT Online.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation expected for the beginning of December on an application for Munich for the Winter Games 2018.
"This preference means that we will have no realistic chances in the period from which we were expected to be until 2028."
However, don't be surprised at the dream for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Bond (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will make the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to compete for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to take a chance by completing the plan at this time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
In addition, a list of applications is contrary to the statement made by the Senate officer on the occasion of a full meeting of the General German High School Sports Association.
There, Beust referred to the application of Hamburg for the University 2015 "not as a substitute" for Olympic games in Hamburg.
In the past week, the High School Sports Association has been nominated by Hamburg as the City of Bewerber.
The SPD bourgeois group suggested that the Senate should not use valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the small Grasbrooks has been delayed for years since he set on the map of the Olympics and cleared up the building," said SPD coordinators Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grasbrooks has always required an integrated planning for Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU has put together on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games had been a great surprise in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was divided into Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols kittens.
Whoever connects the terms of Sweden and woodkist, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At present in Sweden wood-made woodenkists are making dark layers of Warhols' working directory.
A large part of the Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are bottles.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" some months ago had doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes of the year 1968, internal research in Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to a satisfactory result: the six "Brillo Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén of the Moderna Museum 1995, are copies - and most of the hundreds of other Brillo boxes from the "Type Stockholm" are in circulation on the international art market.
The story is obvious, a confusing version of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol built his first "Brillo Boxes", a wooden box that was based on the red-blue-white design of the boardboard of the "Brillo" sailor.
A exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum in 1968 - with Warhols Understanding - out of paper hundreds of Brillo churches: These origins (from cost sources) were not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartonagen factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their models, just about exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol was granted permission to produce a few Brillo wooden kits in Sweden, which were not issued in the Moderna Museum.
Newspapers now speak of about fifty boxes, which have been entered into the art and auction history as authorized original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-boxes with the title "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have earned over $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontis Hultén later claimed it was produced in Sweden in 1968 by about a hundred woodenkistens, who then left Warhol.
In fact, Hulténs 105 kittens were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol had been there for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museum, also examined three of the six museum's Brillo-boxes from Swedish private property, two of which were built in Stockholm in 1968: their presspants were first grounded and washed out, then white oil was poured out with a brush.
The structure of the copies from the 1990s, however, shows that the color with a painting roll was added directly to the presspan plate - it is also not about oil but about acrylic colour.
"These kits were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes," the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, admits: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museum will classify the six kits in its collection as copies/explosive material."
Already in July, the authentication board announced that it would follow the "hard charges" raised in the case of the ship's powder church.
But sooner or later, you'll be stuck in unhindered sweats.
Rebellious Soldiers in Manila
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers appeared in a hotel in Manila and asked President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo for the storm.
He couldn't answer the blood loss, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who was responsible for the president's corruption and elections, reporters in the hotel.
Government ranks of soldiers had knocked down the hotel in front of the train station.
The approximately two thousand soldiers had appeared in the building for hours.
About half of them stood on Thursday for a divorce trial in 2003 before trial - with Trillanes.
He used the deal to sit with about 30 sympathetic people at once.
The military police who should actually guard him were openly on his way to him and shut down his client.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and requested the direction of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops stopped the area around the hotel.
The President introduced a pressing meeting of the Security Agency.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously banned the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other military units wanted to join the march in short.
Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government will be overcome by corruption for months.
Manilas Finance District has already been the main target of the attempted deaths of about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
After nearly 24 hours of refusal of the army, the resistance broke.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven tests against democratically elected governments on the Philippines.
