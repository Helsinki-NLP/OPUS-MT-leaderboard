Welsh Ams is worried about 'looking like a bear'.
In some ams, their speech should be changed to MWPs.
This is due to the change in the name of Amelia because of the change in her name in the Welsh Parliament.
The U.S. are worried that they can be explained by it.
A Liberian AM said that their group is worried that his voice is with Twp and Pwp.
Out of Wales: In Wales, twp means pagle and pwp means powp.
One side of the AM said their group was "not happy" and called for a change.
A Welsh Consortio said their group has a "open mind" about the change in their name, but he said that the language is a distinct language between the MWPs.
In this context, Welsh harab w is the English word for Jark Sher, like U.S.
The sample committee, which is currently preparing a legal case for identifying the change in the name, said: Any statement that makes the final decision on the name of the sample's archini is certainly the Arakinian itself.
The 2017 edition of Wales government gave Welsh sample permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the subject of terrorism, in which there was extensive support for the Assembly's call for the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of AMs, the commission has been delayed by the majority parliament of the Welsh Parliament or by the WMPs, but MWP has received the most support in the public consultation process.
The AMS is clearly recommending exchange of views, but reaching an agreement for President Allen Jones may be a headache, which is expected to collect legal information on changes within weeks.
There are other changes to the way the law works the sample, including the rules on Ams' disability and the design of the committee system.
During the discussion on the Ams Law, they will focus on what kind of speech they should be called.

St. Martin's hours have been quiet when a group of houses in Harlem faced difficulties
Mr. Adams said that in history, whenever I spoke to the old people, he said he was going to become a house again in every village.
Today they are not two.
They said, "It is only for us to forget the interpretation of dreams."
Today's meeting people is different.
Once again, there are no more places where people went on forever.
As far as the total homes are concerned, they are concerned that the number that comes from the past will not be as long as they are expected, and they will be standing where they were going.
They also said that the group houses can be located in the condominium apartment, which will be filled with people who will not help the rest of the area.
They said, "The majority of the buyers in the camps will be white and they will work to close the homes quickly, because there is little chance that the people who move into the mines will stay in the homes."
These two groups were built by white Foam groups before becoming a black Foam Metropolis in Harlem, which was built by the White Foam Groups, after a St. Martin mission in 1870.
In the 1930s, the White Foam Methodist group took place; it was.

Professor Tuffin of the University of Michigan said it was the first carillion to be run by a Black Foam Muskar Dionsio E. Land, who was transferred to a major carillion house 18 years ago.
Mr. My Lady said St. Martin didn't change it.

In the case of general leaders, Sisters, the managing director of Pears, expressed in writing their views on the priest in July that the issue of architects and regulators who sent the matter would be placed on the street, even though the country was not involved in their completion.
Some presidents have complained about the treatment.

Apparently it was scheduled, but it was forced on different ways.
An 68-year-old electrician Narcess Termis, who shared in the show of private tastes with his wife, said that he was no longer optimistic about the prospects of freedom from Catholicism.
Last year, we had the best time.
I saw my parents crying for joy on the radio, but now we're fired.
In December last year, despite the success of the Marjorie district elections, there are difficulties in maintaining this year's movement, because many of their prominent leaders or volunteers are interested in managing a referendum and later declaring freedom.
A 42-year-old young Mexican pianist who was reporting a complaint in support of the police on the phone said both sides had been in conflict.
He said, “The flood is getting bigger and bigger.”
After the last year, one of the most popular New Catalan Canadians announced the week that they would participate in the European Parliament's elections next year.
He said that standing in European elections as a hopemaker is the best way to defeat the domestic and Spanish government's aggressions in general.
London Darrye: Three persons in charge of domestic work
In London Darry, 33, 34 and 39 were arrested and arrested in a multiple-united murder crime in a house.
This event presented the events at around 19:30 B.C.E., according to the usual time in Britain.
Insector Bob Ballings reported that Gath and the building had been damaged.
A single blast of sound was sounded on the scene.
It's 0-1's on the Langston Ranger from the cave of Manga.
Google won first for Lingston in Dolly Manga.
Lingsten, who has been raised, surprised the Rangers by the success of his career, and the second child in the 18th grade of Stone Gerard as manager of the Abrakes Club.
Dolly Mango's strategy was different when he was compared to the other number with the Toby Holt's team hybrid.
Gerard's team is in the prime of this series, without any victory in the ranks of the opponent, and the next round will be against Harts, who is behind eight pounds.
Before that, the Regiments will be created against Ripdwina in the European League.
In the meantime, Langston took his openings to six gyms, and the Hedch Hall was not hit by any damage after he took his place in Kenya Maler last month.
Livingston's battle against Westers is short-lived.
The Hult team should have taken a long time before the score, when their pun had helped the Rangers deal with all kinds of problems.
Scott Rabbson was severely depressed, but he was able to take his coat to the hard hole, and then Alan was able to spread himself even further before he had to face the Ar Perheader from the wheel of the helicopter.
The team director was pleased to allow them to play with them, knowing that they could put Westers in the seat belt.
And that's what led to a very important goal.
Regiers took a few months off, and Livingston started when Declan and Googleger met up with the Queen of Manga, who jumped from the middle of the box.
Up to this point, the Regiers' arrest had been delayed, but they found that the defence of the Maisban team was inexhaustible and that the Goll Capper took care of Kali was a permanent payment.
It's also going to the second week, if George Fordo Morlos got a siota from Kelly.
The Batman was banned by General Allan McGregger of the Regires, and Lahogoro was taken away from another corner of Livingstone.
In Lingston's house, there was a chair with a chair and a chair with a chair, when only two calls were made from the panel -- when Halkit was replaced by Gillin Mallton and for a headball that was rejected.
Lingston's "without reason" - a sample.
Alice Der Lonton of the B.C.S.S.L., in Tony Macaroni, Ireland
There's no regular operation and result for Lingston.
For a man, they were powerful, who showed more than reasonable expectations in the trip.
The style of their games and team has changed little since their turn back on their boots, but the reward goes to Holt, who strengthened the team after his arrival.
And most of them are Al-Hijjah.
The Captain Halkit was strong, who was very well-managed when Mango placed the Connor Goldson and the speaker on five.
However, it wasn't in Reggies.
The good they're doing under Gerard's leadership, they can't meet those criteria.
They didn't have control over their prizes, and they can only raise up against the guests once -- and this is a time of danger for the Rangers while they're in the middle of the score table.
Welcome to Colon for the Army
On Sunday (September 29th), the sky was snowy, when the Turkish and German leaders met on Sunday.
It was the last day of the conflict between the Germans of the army, which was meant to correct relations between the netizens.
They differed in human rights, freedom of the press and the involvement of Turkey in the EU.
The army later ran to open up a huge new temple.
In this town, the most isolated ones have arrived after Turkey.
The police directed security services to prevent 25,000 of them from meeting in front of the council, but several Hammies gathered near to see their employer.
Several anti-combatants -- more than a dozen of them -- gathered together and the police of the army and praised the German government for their good leadership in the country.
They're talking about this, they're praising some German soldiers as heroes, and others think they're an old-fashioned tyrant.
Dispatched Road Event: Destroy the bicycle rides from the track with the mouse
In London, with a driver, a bicycle was lost in the truck.
According to British times, about 10:15 in the south-eastern city of Buge, an Egyptian street in Deepford was presented at the base of Wood Street and Eloin Street.

And in October last year, the police were asked to fire the emergency police, in which Paul was attacked by a police officer.
The danger of the rivers of Silabi Rivers in Fenx, Las Vegas, Salt Lake, from the seabed (can benefit areas affected by drought)
It is wise to be influenced by the wishes of a hare boulevard, but it is quite possible that this will be at the beginning of the next week when the rest of the seabed will be the most powerful desert in the south of the West and threaten the silhouettes.
The National Motivation Service has previously launched a series of guidelines for the Silabi railways for South and Eastern Nevada, South East California and North Africa, including Phoenix, Flag Staff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake Station.
After the spring of the day with rain, Mongolia is expected to walk straight up to Phoenix.
A national media service in Phoenix said in a tweet: "After 1950, only 10 syclons (about 200 miles) have maintained the intensity of the airway or bogulge within 200 miles of Fenix!
The last thing (1967) was a seagull that was within 40 miles of the Zed border."
The most recent models at the centre of the National Seatown are the 2 to 4 inches of rain, while the most densely populated areas in the region of the Ausna Mogul can be raining up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the south-western part of the desert, there may be between 1 and 2 inches of rain, while in the deep part of the region, there may be a total of 4 inches of rain.
In areas beyond the threat of the silhouette rain, the consumed rain will prove to be mercy because it is a waste of dry season.
Although the danger of the river is a heavy god, some rain is likely to benefit because the south-west region is twice as dry as a year.
According to the U.S. Spring Year Monitor, more than 40 percent of the world's dream areas are the top of the world's summer anniversary, which comes in the second highest category, reports weather.com.

The area of Panta Iguana, where the sea was at more than 85 miles [85 km] away in the morning, is 385 miles south of Panta Iguana, and is rising from 12 miles [12 km] north.
The storm is faced with the coldest floods in the world, and its energy is dwindling.
So, it's expected that it's going to be hit by the force of a hurricane in Mexico on Friday or evening.
In some parts of Mexico, the rain can be severe and threaten the river.
According to weather.com, Baga California has a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain and is possible from 10 inches north of California to the north.
The sun will then set the way over the east of Mexico as a summer storm, and the morning will arrive at the threshold of the wish as a summer morning, and it will reach the right of the moon on the south.
The National Ocean Ocean Centre stated that the food and the rest of it would be extremely dangerous in California, North-West Lakes and South-West America.
As a result of these rains, local silhouettes and mountain ranges in the deserts can cause massive flooding.

In Indonesia, hundreds of tsunamis, where they are right, increase in deaths.
The earthquake occurred when at least 384 people in the island of Indonesia died in a severe earthquake in Slovenia and in the tsunami, where they spoke to the truth and a number of skyscrapers. The government announced this week.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palo for a mile, when the upper lines were cut from the roof at six feet (18 feet) and the people and stuff were thrown in their way.
Sonami was born after a 7.5-year-old fever.
Sottopo Prenovo, a translator of the English BNPB, who had lost his ability to lose Indonesia's ability, told a breving in Gjakarta that when the tsunami was threatened the last day, they were still in Egypt on their way, and they didn't escape immediately and became victims of the riots.
Nagorho said that the tsunami had destroyed everything on trees, trees, houses, and the earth with it. He added that the tsunamis would pass the sea by 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour).
They said, "Some people have climbed on trees, and thus have been protected."
Some 16,700 people have been transferred to the relief center in Palo.
The buildings and buildings are destroyed, burned, and destroyed in a temple water.

He said that the city's geography, which is on a long and difficult scale, has increased to the rate of tsunami.
He said, "It's a disaster," and said, "The homes, hospitals, shopping money, and the dead land are ruined."

Nogorho said that the regime is completely destroyed and there is no information from Dongola.
Red Cross reported that there are more than 300,000 people, and he added that his workers and volunteers are moving to an affected area.
He said, ‘This is a she-camel, and there is more to come into it.’
The week before the announcement of the tsunami in Paulo, a riot was directed against Agnes, even though the pledges indicated that the list had arrived within a period of time that had been delayed.
The unprincipled media is being watched by a person standing on a building's top floor on a stand-up site in the village of Samage, warning people of the coming of the tsunami.
He drew water from a wall of water in the minutes and brought out the buildings and the workers along with him.
The director couldn't confirm the photo immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a sudden explosion on a large scale, resulting in a change in the regime of revolutions around the palace, and it was difficult for the government to operate in aid efforts.

They said, "How many houses have been destroyed in the road!"
It's too bad.
Although the relief teams have started a difficult task of moving resources for relief work, some have complained that the most experienced international relief workers are being prevented from traveling to Paulo.
According to Indonesia's rules, funding, supplies and work from abroad can only begin in this way if the location of the natural disaster is a national disaster zone.
Not yet.
A translator from Indonesia's Red Cross told Olya Aryan that it is still the shadow of the south.
Once the government says it's okay, this is a national disaster, we're asking for international aid, but it's not yet done.
And when the hosts came in the night, they called out to God, saying, "We believe in God, and the Last Day." And when the two armies came in, they called out to God, saying, "We will surely be among those who are saved."

Wae West: Ripper changed his name to (Ye)
The Repurchase White West is changing its name.
Advertised a week's change on Twitter, he wrote, "I'm officially known by the name of the toilet."
Octalis of West has been on hold for some time, and they have used it as the title of their eight-year-old album, which was released in June.
This change has been preceded by a partnership in his subsidiary D.N.L., where they are expected to launch their new albums.
They're taking the place of Aryan Grand, who sold their partners on the construction of the "devils" building. The owner of the talk told them.
With their current presidential name hidden, West said before, that the new word is of religious importance to them.
I think 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'.
So I'm you, I'm us and these are us.
It's from the beginning of water, which means only one, and now it's the same -- which is our good, our glory, our concern, and the story of everything.
The album is a story of who we are.
They're from some famous reporters who changed their names.
Sin Komps is known by various names of CD, PD or DD, but this year he announced his preference for the names of Brother Lösch and Brother Lösch.
A former associate of West, Jay-Z, has also been used with and without a name, with a giant and a big snake.
I am determined not to use the army against the cities of Amlo, Mexico
The president of Mexico's election, Andres Löpez Obrador, has expressed his determination never to use the war against the citizens, as blood transfusion against the government continues to increase to 50 years.
Lupes promised the week in Tlateloloko Square "Never promised to use the army against the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, at least 300 people were killed by the soldiers on the platform in the Gaza Strip, while the left-wing movement was under attack in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to help young people open up to higher education institutions, providing them with monthly education.
They said, "A few young men in want of food and education are going to lead the criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double the funding for the IEE
As China's industrial sense is becoming more effective, the United States needs to double the number to be paid for research in this field.
These comments are being made at a time when various parts of the U.S. government have announced E.I., although there is no government in the United States at all.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year. She wants to be number 1 in the IE's interest by 2030.
He said: O ye chiefs! it will be a great favour to double the term, when all the other countries are from the United States, and we are awaiting a great question.
In an interview this week, Lee told C.I.I.D. that trying to double the Foundation would double the chances that the next big success is achieved in the United States.
But, whose book "AI Sprapers: China, Silicon Willi and the New World System" was published this month by the Huton Miffel Harcort, like the IO of the Synovation Ventures. This company is one of China's top companies, ++Face.
In the 1980s, they worked on an IA system that killed Othelo Plyer, the highest ranking in the United States. Later, they were producing a Chinese branch of the Eggschete and Google.
Like the former U.S. government's technology counters such as the Defense Advansed Recursch, the Agency's robot Sazi's keynote was praised and asked when it would happen next time to get to know the next generation's daughter.
Lee said that in the United States, it takes a lot of hard work to get a government member.
He said, "They're not Chinese, but they're Caribbeans who're taking the teaching classes.
Fesbuk, Google and other technological companies have received professional services from universities to work on EI in recent years.
Le said that changes in the U.S. police can also help the United States to promote its ionizations.
They said, "I want to know who's in charge of the P.C.I.."
In July 2017, China's government council launched its next generation's industrial development plan.
Le said that China's national capacity provides funds from the educational institutions that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies were able to finance, but the educational work in China is less than standardized.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a joint industrial project aimed at involving partners from industry and educational institutions, and White House announced the end of the Silekt Committee on Industrial Affairs.
And this year, DARPA announced a progress that is called EI's well-being.
As far as NSF is concerned, it now spends more than 100 million dollars per year on IA research.
In the meantime, the U.S. law on industrial identity has not been effective for months in terms of the end of the National Security Commission.
As a result of the country’s change of name, the Macedonian government took part in the referendum
The Republic of Macedonia has launched a referendum on whether the country's name is "Magauria North Macedonia". This is a step that will resolve several previous disputes with Greece, which has led to the destruction of Macedonia in the European Union and the Network.
Greece, which is called Macedonia, is claiming that its northern home country's name expresses its appeal for its entry into Macedonia and the United States.
Both governments have made a new name agreement in June, but the people's religious opposition has shown that the change in the name of Macedonia will damage the national identity of most of its citizens.
Dr. George Owenov said they won't go to the resort, and the banquet of Beikat has created doubts about whether there will be at least 50 per cent of the train revenue to be refurbished.
The question was, "Are you willing to accept the agreement with Greece on the network and the AY?"
Wezier, the Great Red Cross, believes that it is a country that is a country that is free from the end of Macedonia's Yugoslavia.
In Sofia, 79-year-old Prime Minister Garrözka said: "I have come here today for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live under the shadow of the European Union, because it means our most secure lives for all of us.
Although not legally necessary, the President's majority said they would accept the outcome of the referendum.
There will be two times in Parliament to change the name.
The Government of Liechtenstein said there were no reports of abuses in the first place.

A 62-year-old boy, Tansuki, in the state of Sofia, said that I came here to sacrifice my children and my place in Europe.
On September 30, 2018, the Chief Executive of Macedonia, Zaran Zheif, his wife, Zarika and his son Dskho, were calling for a change in the country's name in Stromica, Macedonia. This will pave the way for the advancement of Macedonia in the network and in the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Spain, 54-year-old Walader Kawadkov has been preparing a small systage for the reactors of the Kavarkov Refrandm, and the chamomiles are breaking down.
Kawaderkov said we're on the network and the AY, but we want to be involved, not through the service door.
We're not a poor country, but we're worth it.
If they don't want to join us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia Association.
Wezier, the chief executive of the network, says that there will be a great need for a government in Macedonia, with more than 20 per cent of the country's unemployment rate.
After his divorce, Zaif said, "I think it's going to be much worse because 80 percent of our cities are about the U.S. and the net.
They said, "Yes," and they said, "We will believe in the future."
Somvara was released by the police department of the state of Macedonia's police department, it was said that 30 to 43 percent will participate in the Walter River, which is less than the required train ticket.
Another survey conducted by the Taliban TV in Macedonia says 57 per cent of respondents want to give up Tatar.
70 percent of them said yes.
In order to succeed, the train must have a volume of over 50 percent.
In the West Bank, the government will be severely shaken by the lack of power in the West Bank, which has gained power in May last year.

But the teacher, who is always on the run, wants to play against Colorado Raquez, but only if there's blue-fly content for Raquez, who prefers a song on Las Angeles Deggers in the National League of West.
Raquez got at least a blank card with a 2-5 win at Nischens on Friday night, but he's still about to get his first dolphin title.

And he's trying to get back from any source. You're a weak one, you're looking at them.
They don't think who's hurting, and who's running to get power and control, they just need power and control, and we won't give them both.
They said that the Democrats are on the mission of ‘simplification and torture’.
They said to the Democrats, "You have seen this in the last four days."

On the importance of the responsible social policy, on national peace, on Europe, on things that have not been agreed with former leaders.
The meeting of Natengham's meeting at the East Liberian is said to be, "We want to make the meetings fun and upbuilding."
For more than eight years, the local Liberian IMP was like that, for more than eight years, the meeting of the Assembly was exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, many meetings have not been held, and "The promise of mercy and mercy of politics has been long forgotten, of course, even if it has ever begun.
It is clearly clear that the Liberian party has not been subjected to anti-aircrafts and that every view is seen as whether it is acceptable for the party's membership.
It's just about becoming a leader of the Germy, because I was with those who used to think that I had a political point like mine, who started to expect me to take the U.S. train and take the stand that I would never otherwise agree with -- whether it's national peace or the A.U.
When I talk to the public -- whatever I want to say -- there's going to be a wave of tension and tension in the media, there's going to be a demand for resistance, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the lobby party.

Of course, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because there's a lot of political issues about me.
I'm surprised at the well-being and determination of those with whom we are dealing with every day on the basis of sexual and racial torture, but who don't give up hope.
One of the most disillusioned political leaders in the Far East is how it has become a matter of action.
Germy Kurrabin called last week that Liberian party should promote the conduct of tolerance.
In fact, we no longer have a large audience at home, and it becomes more difficult to see a party with the movement of any distrust or a change in the rules of election.
In the past two years, I've been advised to keep my head down, not to be so clear, so I'll be fine.
But I didn't come to politics to do that.
When I became a student 32 years ago as a student of a school, I became a member of the government that was about to finish my Comprehensian School class, and I have been able to apply in Liberia, I have tried to serve the best in public for those who need it most — whether as a local council or as a government official.
I've never hidden my politics, including the previous election.
No one in the Natongham East has ever been killed in an agreement on my policy with the stand-up and current lawyer.
I'm just saying about the people who have encouraged the summit that when the country is hit by Bridget, which will damage families, businesses and our public service, I don't want time and energy to prove my loyalty with the leader of the Liberian party.
But just a message that I don't just want to give to the viewers of my career, whether they're in the library or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise I won't stop me from working on what I think is the best thing to do.

IR 17 - 38 milligrams: Unconquered IR Top
Two recent efforts could result in a slight decline, but there is no doubt that Irre was entitled to win the surprises of this Tenets Premiere Party and the entertainment mix.
They are now the top of the table and one of the ten teams that have not been hit.
Finally, because of their best defense and chance, they were successful and they had the right to enjoy the past Peter.
They said, "We have been tested in our game, and we are still unconquered, so I shall be pleased.
The robin Kristey of Marjos said: "Ir is going to be commended, they've made a better effort on our side.
The 14-minute attempt of Grant Anderson, which was modified by Professor Clemour, led to an increase in Ireland, but the captain of St. London, Rory Hoogs, was allowed to add a yellow card to the number, and a similar attempt was made by Mr. Beugt.
Klemo has strengthened the area of Ireland with a panel at a full week's time. They have scored a score and then turned the single attempt into a score of 5-17.
But Melross made the next week's turn, and the attempt of Peter Anderson, who changed his mind, has changed his mind.
The Reedh Nott was too late to be hit by a serious injury, and when the game started again, it became even worse when Climus changed the effort of St. McDoll.
Then the Irre's neighbor's Captain Biller McFerson was shown by the Yellow Card and once again, Wednesday benefited from the presence of additional radiation, and Bruce Clawen made an effort that could not be changed.
The Maisban team game returned, but when the yellow card was shown to draw the album without a prize, Microsoft posted the prize on the air attack on the network.
Klemo took the scour, as he had begun to start again, before that, Kael Rue collected a bag of David Amerstrac's bunker and made a five-pound attempt at the office.
A new career in St. James's Star Restaurant
Styl Jim's Star Ford Karenan is ready to move to the factory, and it has been discovered that his name is included in the directors of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star, Professor B.B.C., gives the role of Jack Jaers, who write and present along with a long-term vice president's voice.
They announced that the next nine will be the final stage of the settlement and that it seems that after the Craig Ling, Karen's plans to leave forever are being closed.
According to the top record listing, they're the directors of the Operatorn Limited.
The user has refused to review the news, even though the SATS have said that Karenn Glasgian is trying to get involved in the 'increased restaurant trade'.
"The sea is ours," he said, "that the way may be opened for the people of Paradise.
In La Paz, the sailor is turning into a baobab and is turning around the seaheadwaters.
On top of the buildings, the sea is covered with snow-coloured candles.
From Lake Titicaca, to the seabed, this statement is written: "We have the right to the sea.
"It's our duty to take it back."
It's still fresh to remember that in the 19th century, a bloodthirsty collection of blood is banned from the sea of the sea -- and also the desire to travel by sea in the Gulf.
Now these hopes are now at its highest level in many diions, while Bolivia is waiting for the decision of justice on October 1 after its five-year operation.
A Bolivian consultant, Roberto Calzadilla, said that Bolivia has a sense of force, unity and tenancy and hopes to achieve a positive outlook.
Most Bolivian states will see the decision of the ICJ on major screens across the country, hoping that the Hague will decide on the invitation to Bolivia, that after the numerous rounds of demonstrations, it is the responsibility of Bolivia to participate with it in a self-selective way to the sea.
Polio's technical personality also had to be challenged by author Evo Morales, who had to make a decision on the matter of Sumara.
In August, they decided that their country would be very close to returning to the Pacific.
But some scholars believe that justice cannot be judged on the issue of justice, and even if it does so, it will not change much.
In the Netherlands, the state has no authority to bring them to the justice of the Union, and he has determined that he will not determine the outcome of any entertainment.
According to a Chinese expert, in the National Law, the decision of the ICJ is only being made six months after the last injury has been heard, which shows how 'no spread.'
Instead of promoting Bolivia's goal, it may have hurt him for the past four years.
Zarat said that the current management of the island has checked the issue of access to the sea.
They said, "Moralise's argument has ended the rest of the story.
He said that he could keep talking for a while, but then it would be very difficult to play.
The two countries have not replaced the sphericals since 1962.
Former President Edward Rodrguez Lotze, who is represented by Bolivia in the Hague, has turned away from the idea that the decision of justice was not usually speeded up.
He said that Saturday is an unforgettable opportunity to open up a new distance of relations for Bolivia and end 139 years of non-agreement for mutual benefit.
Calzdilla insisted that Morales, who are still one of Latin America's top approved adults, are using the sea as a political tool.
They said, “He says, ‘We will never submit ourselves to the Lord of the Worlds.’
The decision of justice is an opportunity to forget the past.
North Korea: Anti-Alarms Not Trusted in the United States · Global Voices
North Korea's state of being out-of-rey Reyung says their country will never be a member of the Ethmian army when it does not trust Washington.
Rey had been talking to the General Assembly at the United States Assembly.
They asked the United States to fulfil the promises made in the main meeting between the citizens of the two countries in the market.
Their impact has come in the meantime when U.S. refugees from outside Mike Pempio, Singapore, are re-starting a three-month visit to North Korea to start the Etme Safarization.
Rey said: "It's a shame that the US opposition will force North Korea to fall down on the declaration of the end of the Taliban and the Korean war in the camps.
Weshington Pung Jang's report has made significant progress on the secret weapon without being able to publish it.
Less and less U.S. President Donald Trump wants to meet with the other two leaders.
But there's a lot of doubt about the fact that Ping Yang is a weapon that he thinks is the only guarantee of his peace.
The Pope wants to remove the next month's Ping Yang for the preparation of the second major meeting between the Pempus and the tramp.

If you want to increase your host's keys or stop the daemon completely, don't wait any longer.
The designers Vantino and the Tooth Brownie have shown the heads of the big silk head on their SS19 crowns, which has restored the style set in Paris fashion.
At the time of the summer, there was a great deal of heat on the installation, and the designers sent their powerful users to Kate Wak.
The most visible from Valentine's Day was the high-coloured Beige hat, which covered the heads of the medals.
In other large-scale magazines, the trophies, the magic team, and a lot of an ounces -- but they're not designed to warm your head.
Doum also showed the choice of the kind of masks that are being presented at the site of En Halwin.
Most of the gangs were on the edge of Moscow, and they were looking at Hannibal Lecter instead of a new fashion.
One of them was like a Google and a singling tree, when one of them looked like another.
And if you keep going on the fashion story, you're a happy part of it.
It is predicted that in large numbers, these points will become the beauty of your neighborhoods.
The great-grandfather's hat, "La Bomba," came to the front of the gate after the gate, which had been torn two feet from Rihana, and was seen on everyone's head until Emly Radakosque.
After the extremely unpredictable hit, a group of Labels, which had been distributed on the entire Soviet media, brought another big hole in the catwalk -- made up of tanks, which is almost as big as the ball in your bag, which is the model to carry it up.

Jean Edward: The skills needed for the world’s cities
The free school record of education in Scotland has been established, and this record has been followed with great test results in 2018, which has been strengthened by individual and social success in the fields of games, movies, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 requests in full-time states, this school, whose representative is the Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is trying to provide applicants and parents with the best way to provide services.
Free schools prepare their candidates for their next and higher education, as their elected careers and world cities.
As a class of education that can produce and use a better school, we see new languages in schools as an acceptable and popular subject.
Nelson Mandilla said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, he's going to be in his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, he will bring it to his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English in terms of relationships and trust from other countries.
As a result of this year's current test, we can see that in free schools, languages are on the top of the League Tables with the clearest way to get closer.
In total, 68 per cent of foreign-language readers received Hierre Grid.
The data collected from 74 schools in SCIS shows that 72 per cent of students received Hierde E in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German readers, 69 per cent of French readers, and 63 per cent of Spanish readers also received EE.
It shows that free schools in Scotland support the important skills that children and young people need in the future.
The location of free schools and the selection of content in other places is now the only impact of STEM issues (scientific, technological engineering and nutrition).
According to the YO's modest diet and skills, in 2014, one agency found that 17 percent of the problems in filling empty seats had been reduced to 17 percent of the language skills.
So the ability to prepare young people for their career in the future is becoming more and more distasteful.
As there is a need for languages for more jobs, these skills are needed in today's world.
As you can see from the careers, if someone has learned another language, they will be really useful in the future because they have such skills.
Having the ability to communicate with people from other countries is a challenge for a large number of elderly people from outside the country.
YouGov Paul, who served more than 4,000 people in Britain in 2013, said 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language properly, and French is the only language spoken by two Indians, 15 percent.
That's why today's kids need to get involved in language reading.
In a number of languages, especially in advanced ways, I have increased the opportunities to have a good day for children.
In Scotland, different languages are read in each school.
Multi-schools focus more on new classical languages, while others learn languages that are most important to Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child likes, there will always be a variety of languages in free schools, and there will be an effective teaching tool in this community.
The School of Free Schools is trying to provide educational environments that enable children to develop and develop skills to succeed in the future.
In the global business environment of this time, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country, so it should be in the symbolic teaching.
Of course, the new languages should be viewed as "see National Consequences".
This election, diversity and nationalism will continue for young people in the Free School Suite Land.
You have to do it.

This is the first of the five tracks of the first five of the bomb hits for the next week, including friendly locations including tennis and Mississippi for a short time.
In order to build on the empty session of the Sprim Kurt, they are under pressure, and efforts are being made to provide public support for the mid-term elections in the tropics because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of their control over the cancers in the elections in November.
What time is the West Virginia night, and how can you see it online?
In the West Virginia area of the Trip, Rili will be 7 Friday evening, September 29, 2018, according to the weather in Reley West.

It is possible to talk about a week's hearing of the missing person for the tramp press for a week that has been disturbed by the allegations of gender abuse and that the research of the FBI has been completed for a week to complete.
However, the main purpose of the rally is to help the Republicans act for the November elections.
So, according to Ratters, the presidential board of the Tromp's election announced that in the coming week, the aim of the rally was "to create an incentive for volunteers and supporters while trying to protect and expand the majority of the Republican Senates and Evan representatives."
A translator of the Trip's election campaign who refused to reveal his name told Reuters, "It's important to maintain control over the cancer for the agent of the press so that they can travel as far as possible as possible while we are fighting against the Egyptian penal regime."
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's evening in Isbanco Arena, in the Avalanche, "the Hague and Pennsylvania will gather the Hammies and will receive the Kuoraj of the Patzburg media."
In the last month, the other time, the storm left West Virginia, a government where they won over 40 percent of their profits in 2016.
For the tropics, West Virginia's Republical Hope Patrick Morrise is trying to help the electoral police.
According to Ratters, a political scientist in West Virginia University said that it is not a good sign for Morris that the President is coming to bring them to Poland."

After the third half of the session, the second half of the week was the life of this radar cap against the couple.
The amount of Pandolam's movement is completely created with a picture of the game, but a picture they believe with a bright heart, and it's never going to happen like they're in the opposites.
What is the matter with them that they say: "Where is he now?"
As the day progressed slowly, Jordan Spartacus said, "They've got six pounds, and now they're four, so I think we're taking it as a little bit of a move.
Of course, Europe gets better, with four points ahead, when they can try to get ten more.
As Sparta said, the Americans feel that their emotions are too small and that they have enough to hope, especially in the form of beauty and the taste of honey that they've been playing all day, and each received three percent.
They're paying special attention to the funeral and they set an example.
When their radio went up, the screams of the wicked were getting higher when they threw the candle with the light of the light into the basket and put it in four pieces, one at a time when Thomas and they were behind two percent.
When they were hit by 15 their golfers, they were so happy to be raised to cry for evils, in a way that tells you that they don't think the American team was out of hand yet.
Sparta says you just have to work hard for your shirt and worry about it.
It's just that every one of those shots is gone.
The city's way is 18 miles away.
In the past two days, more than a hundred and fifty-six-pounds have been found in Francesco Molenarie and Tommy Fleet Wood, a Muslim story told by the Reider Cup.
The team of Europe is amazing, but it's a couple of perfect, and it doesn't expect them to go wrong.
"Molly Wood" was a single couple who didn't cut a bullet in the week, but they saved the balls in the morning of the week, the rest of the group, and then again in the morning.
This speed, and the measure by which they are able to move from and up to them, builds the conviction that they are the only light that can be reached on Saturday, and that no acceptable light will be placed against them except the arrowwood or Molenary, which can ensure the victory of the European team as the sun goes down on the Gulf of Nessell.
On top of each other.
The words of the glory and glory of Europe have been spoken long ago, and yet again.

Tavara, of course, you won't have anyone to help you get out of the shower.
The interaction between couples, the advice they offer, the advice they do not give, and the amount of wisdom that changes in the course of the day and the time of the morning is very wonderful to see the beauty of the morning and the evening.
The team of Europe has so far proved to be a good game as a team and has maintained its superiority until the last day, but this press session has shown that it is also my desire to meet with the Team Yo S.A., which some people wonder about, particularly the state side.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day of the Rider Cup.
On the day of the week of the political union, the European Leader will appear with a clear majority on the last day of the European Day of the Day of Atonement.
The couple of Tommy Fleet Wood and Francisco Molenary's protest began with two openings on the battle against the tiger Woods in the battle, and in the Gulf, they still brought their trailer up to four pounds.
The European team of Thomas Beiron, who has been trying to maintain its traffic lost in Hezlten two years ago, is headed for the US team in the morning's open-air contests, and is running from 3-1.
The U.S. has been more upset in the face of formal opposition and lives two games, but it has not been completed.
The team of Gem Führck has an eight-point requirement in the 12-pockets of the Tawara to maintain the truffle.
Before the Fleet Wood European Team, the first couple in the history of the Reider Cup were the first couple to get four points when he was married to his miller, who was married to Mole Wood, who was married to a son-in-law after a son-in-law, and was the first husband in the history of the Reider Cup, who received four points in his first four matches.
After breaking up Woods and Petrock Reid in the morning, they brought together the most powerful 5&4-permanent Indians and the U.S. Brice Dachambivo.
Woods, who managed to make it difficult for the week in two, showed an agreement of the same size and size, but they have already broken 19 out of 29 out of 29 out of the summer, and seven out of them.
Hutton's day, who had settled in the morning's neighborhoods, went back to work with Henrick Stanson in Sams, and Dustin Jansen and Brooks, some of whom were the first and the third of the world's rankings, broke off from 2&1.

They won a victory on Spain's life path in the spring, and on Ain Potter, they won a 2&1 victory, and then they broke off the police and Michaela by 4&3 after the two explosions in the morning.
In the history of the radar cap, only two times a team can be returned to the game after the loss of four points, even though the team needed to compare only the match to keep track.
After two days on the other number, it turns out that Tavara's response attack will be out of reach.
North Korea says without confidence, "there's no reason" to be unarmed.
North Korea's external government told the United Nations on Sunday that the Taliban is destroying their country's confidence in the Soviet Union, and in such cases there would be no question that their country is in a position to support its nuclear weapons.
Reyung Hu told the World Assembly's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken up the last year "recorded progress on the four-year cycle", such as the blockade of the Ethme and the missile test, the end of the end of the end of the atom test, and the end of the atomic tests, and the end of the atomic weapons and the end of the atomic technology.
They said, "But we don't see the reaction from the United States to it.
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national peace, and in any case we will not be unarmed once in a while.
When Rey quoted North Korea's complaints about the intelligence of the Tehfef Etme weapon for the "Water War" act, they are well aware that they did not completely reverse the secret weapon, as Pong Jang was doing in the past.
On June 12th, the U.S. President-in-C.A. and North Korea's leader, Mr. Young, referred to the joint announcement that they had attended the first major meeting among them, in which he promised to try to "clean up the Koreans of the Crimea with the Ethmian authorities," while the Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to end the Korean war of 53-1950, but the U.S. government said Pung Yang will first destroy his nuclear weapons.
Weshington also praised the demands to silence strong national officials in North Korea.
Rey said, "The U.S. attacks on "the First Secret of the Anti-Violence" and adds pressure to achieve his goal in the Gerry scale, even denying "the declaration of the end of the war"
The idea that slaves can force us to cut us down is a secret idea of those who don't know about us.
The problem is, however, that slavery is increasing in distrust.
Rey did not mention any arrangements for a second major meeting between the minority and the storm, which the U.S. Presidents had previously held in the United States.
Instead, Wezer mentioned in particular three meetings between the leaders of South Korea in the last five months, and the leader of South Korea, Mondean, and he said, "If this secret group of nuclear weapons had not been in South Korea, it wouldn't have been that way."
However, Rey's speech was alarmingly different from last year's speech, when he told the U.S. general sample that he had refused to build the U.S. territory with the North Korean rockets after establishing a self-propelled machine.
Trump, who had threatened North Korea last year to "completely destroy" this year, thanked the United Nations for taking steps towards the safest nuclear weapon, but he said there's still a lot of work left and there's still to be kept in custody until the nuclear weapon is destroyed by North Korea.
The train said that they have no team farm, no difference if they spend two years, three or five months in it.
China and Russia argues that the UN should pay for the promotion of the United Nations Peace Council.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Poppyo, told the UN Security Council to gather togethers: "The effectiveness of the Security Council's services should continue with and without delay until we reach the goal of a complete, reliable and proven safe nuclear weapon."
The Peace Council has increased its efforts to ban funds for the atoms of Pung Yang and the Belstik missile programs in the North Korea since 2006 with agreement on the North Korea regime.
Pampyo met with the United Nations General Assembly on the Saudi Line and then told them they would travel the next month to Pong Yang for the preparation of the second major meeting.
Pampio has been away from North Korea three times this year, but their final distance is not good.
While running from Pong Yang in July, they said, "It's gone, but only a few hours later, North Korea has criticized them for "a request like a song."
North Korea promised this month a chance to create a missile with me to complete an end to an atomic compound, even though the government took "responsive progress" together.
They said, "The less you told them, "the more you want, the more you want, the more you want, the more you want, the more you've got to do with it.
A program to get enough sleep for the hard heart.
The Harvard University suggested that this year, under a new course, all its entrants should receive more sleep in order to be able to cope with the death rate increased by the help of Kevin through "the night out".
One teacher, Dan, learned that the first world-class university polls are often ignorant when words are very fundamental things, such as how they feel.
A specialist Charles Caesar has prepared a course at Harvard Medical School, which they say is the first course of his kind in America.
After a talk on the impact of sleep loss on reading, they were moved to start the course.
They said, "A girl came to me at the end of the story. She said, "Why does this come to me when I am an old woman?"
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping -- a fact that surprised me.
This course, which is the first time this year, explains how the good habits of gold help in the work of education and games, and also improves their general performance.
In Harvard Medical School, Professor of Mental Health and University Health, Eggsikto Paul Brera said that after learning this, the university decided to get to know the students at least a little sleep during the week.
The course of the hour includes a series of practical techniques.
In a store, there is a picture of a hotel room children, who search for caffeine and light and how sleepless games affect their performance and click on enough hats, clothes, coaches and books to learn about the importance of gold traditions.
In another business, partners are told how to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer from long to long sleep.
A successful partner of the campus, acting with surprises, encourages him to think about his daily expenses.
Paul Cisler added, we know that the situation of the applicant will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know -- just like you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose a syringe.
They said that there is still a tendency to feel proud about "nighting" and added that the demand for new technology and ever-increasing pressure means that sleep is a growing problem.
They said, "Make sure you sleep well enough to cope with stress, fatigue, and anxiety, even if it is to protect you from a storm.
A 19-year-old California scientist, Raymond So, who is studying chemistry and mathematics, helped Professor Paul Cisler to prepare the course. He had previously taken a class in Harvard during his first year.
He said he opened his eyes and made a hole in it to try to start a course in the entire campus.
He hopes to complete the same type of educational program before the next phase of all postgraduate applications are included in an equivalent institution.
Professor Sizeller said that it should be considered when to go to bed and when to stay awake and inform them of the adverse effects of the "Nil Light" coming out of the windows and LED light. This light can cause the sleep problems in your system's change of night and day.
From a cypher at Langston’s Rangers: Mango killed Gerard’s tigers with a bullet
Regiers was struck by another anxiety when a wave of Doloy Mango hit Stan Gerard's unbounded team in Lingston with a bullet in his face.
The team of the Abruks had been looking for its first team record in February after its 4-1 success, but the team of the U.S. Hallt team had managed its second hit on the manager Gerard in 18mm, leaving its team only eight pounds away from the Lidbroks Premierp Leder Harts's acquisition.
Mango stole seven minutes ago, and he was not able to compare it with his passion and enthusiasm to the Regirs Team.
While the regents are now on the black numbers, Lingston has stolen the third number and only followed by Hebron.
There may be further difficulties for Gerard when the Lensmine Colom Spain apparently threw something from the other head into her head.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which led to the Irish Batford Cup's finals.
On the other hand, Holt went out with Livi 11 who made a point from Harts last week, and he'll be happy about the fact that his back was lost by the opponents on each turn.
The Rangers may be missing, but Lingsten has put the prize in his control.
They only scored within two minutes of the start of the game, when the first time they were on the ground was due to the first time they were on the ground, the SAT-Pantman died in the cave of Ellen Macgreg, but Medfielder saved it on time.
When Jaxbs came to the hall by the distance, they were able to get their defence partner Alan to throw the prize only to the back pocket.
Regulators must have gained control of the game, but in the final part of the third, they could only be hoped for.
Fredo Morlos must have felt that he had a pen when he was thrown between him and Stan Lalis, but Refrey Stone Tumson had turned the streets of Colombia.
Regiers could only kill two shots a week ago, but before he was arrested, he had to face no great anxiety from the head of Corleville and the weakest of the U.S. Army.
In 34 minutes, there may have been a rebellion against the top of Levii's music, but no one could deny that it was their first need.
Once again, the regeners failed to break the geekbs plan.
Sut Arreland did not react immediately when the Decelian singer threw him to the feast hall, and he chose to die to finish his plan with pleasure.
In his defense, Gerard replaced the Royal Cant instead of Colombia, and this change was almost an immediate effect when the Negro won Morius, but affected Kelly ran away from his own line to stop him.
But Lingsten kept the guests busy playing his favorite music when the Lahog and the Halkit were playing a long time joke after each other.
In the final phase of the Hult team, he could have added to his team when Lagreo dropped off to Heder Jacquez, but Michael Greer came on the way and failed their efforts.
Gillin Madelton, a replacement of the Rangers, called for a pen when he had a fight with Jax but Thomason ignored him.

Ragerz: "It's a power plant, which is used to record natural dimensions, such as yoranim.

The new system environment of the cancer can train future clients to ‘see’
The new system of cancer can train the future to ‘see’ and kill them.
This helps to identify the system’s benefits as part of the treatment.
It involves removing a patient from a hospital and changing him into a leukemia.
Then they can see a protein, which is common in all foods, and then they are re-entered into the body.
It's showing promising results in different types of experimental and xenophobic cancers.
A wife who has been treated with this vaccine has been missing for more than 18 months from cancer in Denmark, which is training to demonstrate the strength of the vaccine against future infections.
To remove a disease from the pathology, to convert it into a label so that they can find proteins that are common in many cancers, which are called HER2, and then it includes re-entering these cells into the body.
Bethesda, professor of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, in my country, said: "Our results show that we now have a great hope and a hope for the future.
Professor Brzewki explained that the HER2 "is due to the increase in some types of cancers", which include cancer of the liver, the kidneys, the lungs, and the liver.
The same kind of practical wisdom has been achieved in a kind of treatment of leukemia that helps patients to benefit from the disease and make them the target of cancer cells.
After his SNL operation, the MAGA hit the storm storm bridge.
What a mistake it would be to do so!
He praised U.S. President Donald Trip and said that after they fought again for the election of the President in 2020, the Sicter de Nott Lawosche in the Studio showed hostility during the U.S. War.
That night, after his third dream, called Ghost Town, where he was raised by a large American mob, he swore against the Democrats and returned his support for the storm.
"How can we like the storm? He's a god."
He said, "Well, if I were concerned about ethnicity, I'd have been moved from the United States a long time ago."
The SNL has taken a stand with the King's innocent met Diamond, where Hally Wood Star has played a witness against sexual harassment against her by the Justice Committee of the British Kawano's Center for Justice.
Although it was not published, West has been uploaded to the media by the entertainment director Chris Rake.
It's not clear whether Rak wants to explain the weather through this postging.
In addition, Wast complained to Shakin that he had to face difficult times because of his team.
"He threatened me after Steggy.
They said, "Don't go to the stadium with that crowd."
They threatened me!
According to Washington Igzamer, he told me that then he said to me, "I'm in a bad place."
He said, "You want to see where you're going to go?" He said, "He's going to pick up his shoes, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to grow?
Try love."
Ratty Magazine reported that because of her reviews, the Shakin showed less than twice that he disliked himself and that SNL's editors were looking at the anxiety, one of them said, "But the studio was completely quiet."
West was replaced by Glucara Arina Grand, who had been taken as a replacement for the former French reporter Mike Maler a few days before his death.
West was wearing clothes like old-fashioned bott, and he threw a lot of people out of his smile 'I love him'.
Wast was supported by the head of the TPSA religious group's leader, Kandis Turner, who tweeted: "Peace be with one of the most popular souls: thanks to the struggle."
But Taksha's mayor Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just displaying his personality, and that is somewhat surprising.
"I have chosen not to reward a person (to buy his music, or to buy his clothes, or to support his "fun"), which I think is the idea of being a self-containing and forward-looking person who is in charge of my conscience.
He's free.
So we are free," they said.
Prior to Shaw, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now "can normally go on with the name of Kenya West."
He's not the first scientist who changed his name, and the DD, which is also known as PD, is running on the map.
His partner's name was Sonop Dagg, and, of course, former music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
In the Béflast Restaurant, a victim of attempted suicide attempts to kill the Shaqao.
In East Belfast, a restaurant accused a 45-year-old of trying to kill a person on the day of the wedding.

The famous man of the game of Thérones, the star of Cheerington, ran into the worship of the goddess of magic.
The KTHERINGTON HBO is known for its role as a film star in the art of filming.
However, 31-year-old actor Hero, who is a victim of death, was shocked by the behavior of the board and said that on screens, it means that young boys often feel that they have to be hard enough to be admired.
Speaking to The Sande Times Calendar, Kate said they think 'it's a mistake' and asked how #MeToo was dealt with with the problem of the Zoroist worship.0.
Kate, who is currently married to her partner in the game of Thérones, married on the 31st of July, admitted that they are well aware of the problem.
They said, "I am very concerned at this time about how wrong we have been in promoting man worship.
What do we teach men when they were growing up because of the problems we are seeing?
Some believe that a woman named Tili could be held in a position to be responsible solely for her high-ranking men because of her worshipers.
They said: "What is it that he has created, and that he has been taught?"
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, it makes children feel that they will have a special attitude to be men.
I think this is a big question of our time -- how do we change this fact?
'Cause it's obvious that there's something wrong with training young men.'
They also admitted in the interview that in the next summer, when the game's performance is finished, they won't be able to do that again, because they've grown up with war and horses.
From November, a film producer and his brother will appear in the post of True West, a film based on the story of a doctor.
The audience has already shown the fact that they believe that meeting their wife on the day of their meeting is the best gift they have ever received.
He said, "I'm going to get my wife into this hole, so he gave me my future family and a new life ahead of him.

ECH IV/AIDS: 14 percent increase in China's new ways
China has announced 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Doctors have reported that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by it.
Only about 40,000 new reports were reported in the second six months of 2018.
The vast majority of new species have been affected by gender, which is contrary to past culture.
Typically, in some parts of China, HIV has spread rapidly through the transfer of blood.
However, Chinese medical practitioners in a conference in Greece in the South said that this way, the number of people affected by him was almost zero.
Over the years, however, the number of HIV and AIDS deaths in China has reached 100,000.
The transfer of HIV through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT Comunity.
In China in 1997, we were established in spite of racial prejudice, but it is said that nationalism is still common against LGBT people.
Because of the country's religious background, Stedez has concluded that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men are finally married to a man who has sex.
More than the transfer of these diseases, it's because of inadequate sexual security.
In order to address this problem, the Chinese Government has promised to take immediate action from 2003 to 2003 by EchV.
Mexico Waters has been added by their staff to record the data of the GOP Senator, a "dangerous lie" and a "preventive opinion"
The President-in-Office of the United States of America, Maxine Waters, accused the weekly of being accused of spreading personal information from three Republican senators on one of the media pages of law firms.
The Democrats from Las Angeles insisted that such calls are being made by pandas and Web sites of "High-right Lefts".
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said, "It's all lies, lies, and a lot of lies."
In the information received, U.S. senators from South Carolina include the London and North Mike and the Houses and the Phone numbers from South Carolina.
Information collection has appeared online, which was published during the hearing of a satellite panel hearing of a missing person in the Capitol Hall against British Kawano's sexual abuse charges.
This information was collected after some time after the senators objected to Kawano.
Hall reported that former religious sites, such as Gutwey Pandett and Reed State, have been reported to have been banned from the IPA Address Waters book, and to provide information on the work of Waters.
Walter added that it was completely wrong and a plain lie.
Keeping my work, which is a threat to identity, personal information and security as a result of these frauds and false accusations is not a responsibility to take these information away.
It is a completely false and open lie.
Water's statement was immediately published online, which includes the press secretaries of the former White House.
The Palestinians wrote that this was an outrage.
It turns out they don't like to have cancer.
When a person is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
They should not be forced to do so.
They should not be questioned about the fate of those who accuse them of wrongdoing.
So let them ask questions and be careful of (their duty to) Allah.
It was seen that the balance of Flash Water's response was being questioned by the Democrats on Java Kawanuts, who accused Nagan of having become more angry during the hearing of the meetings on Kawanuts.
In the mid-term elections, the rival republican hope age Navaro also expressed his views on Twitter.
They said, "Indeed, he is informed, if what you say is true."
In his statement, Waters said that their books had rejected the law and the law of the law on these false claims.
They said, “We will surely believe that the people of the town are brought before the eyes of the people, and that their deeds are made lawful for them, and that they are destined to be destroyed for another people.”
Johnny English Strikes Again's Inconsistencies Research - The World of the Unauthorized Gessus Ron Atkinson
It has now become a reality to see the importance of Bright's new film on any British point of view, but this is not true of the update of Johnny English's unsubstantiated media franchise, which started with Johnny English in 2003, and was re-viewed with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will the self-contained tone of the article be the new opportunity to come out of this people?
In any case, the eye came out and the face-to-face-to-peak was allowed to update things again with English -- and that its sign was more than anything else -- a larger fun for non-English regions.
Of course, it is a crazy secret agent who has only one head presenter in the 2012 Olympics, in spite of his wonderful and poor creative words.
At the beginning of his work, he was based on a national passenger and bus driver who used to come to the TV shows in the old card and left behind a passport.
It's one or two good speeds in the latest JE dating.
I liked the gold of the English Crown and the flag of the Church, and I liked it growing up on a Halley Capter.
The Athnosene show is on the screen for the physical weekend, but it is not known in the entertainment, and it is seen in a surprising and poor way, especially in the "swift" film brand, such as 007 and Mission Impossible.
Unfortunately, it's for young children rather than adults, and I don't think the secret movements of English are as new and as new as the secret movement of the brain moves attenuation of the atoms into the personality of the brain.
Now the permanent district issue is that Britain is in great anxiety.
A cyber hacker has entered the top secret web network and shows all British agents in the field. Now it's becoming a disease for the existing agent. It's a little less than a sad limit for Ireland.
It's the last sign for the great crowd, which is a hearty weak person of honour and dignity, who has been the victim of a completely political crime.
The counsel of their Italians says that because every act is dangerous, they'll have to bring someone down.
And it means that the letter of error is to bring up the English itself, which is now assigned as a school master in a covered area, but it's a story about being a gessus: it's hard to stop gambling in some places, because it's a school of research that conducts a school of the Rock type.
Johnny is taken to the White Room for a temporary bruffing, and he's been reunited with Bough's long-lasting partner, whose work is being done by Ben Miller.

So in the Royal High Security Service, there is an attempt to reassemble things on the way of the Son of Man and Robin, which is faced by the first Korean month of Guinea, Ophilia Baltofa.
In the meantime, Wezer is dangerously involved in the magic of some sort of trick Arabic tape that claims to be able to solve the concerns of the British computer: Anhoss like the Volta, whose actor Jake Lissie gives.
Johnny and Boe come out of their bright, fast-colored clothes; they fire a French restaurant in the fireplace; they create themselves in a wolt's fishing boat; and the English people who create their own property when they try to use the virtual real estate to be seen from the insides of the Wolta's house.
All of the victims have been saved for the last thing, but as hard as they're playing, the whole movie looks like you're watching the TV of the kids.
There is enough space between them.
And like with other English films, I'm always forced to think, "Can't the British film industry be able to do something that can be just with its ability to do it?"
The Libre party has suggested that it is making arrangements for the citizens of Britain to work four days a week, but it's worth five days.
Jeremy Corban's Liberian Party is considering an emergency plan that will work for four days a week, but it will be five days a week.
According to the information party, the company wants its employees to transfer to its employees a further day-to-day storage and to transfer the child from the industrial memory to the workers.
It's going to be a three-day walk away from the same Andes, but the house will be taken just the way it was before.
She said that it would be “the days” for the party's economic agenda and arrangements that they want to impose on the country on its employees.
After four days of transfer, the Trade Union Congress has confirmed that it is possible to benefit workers from the changed environment.
A senator from the Liberian party told The Sande Times: The statement of opinion on the police is expected to be made before the end of the year.
It won't be that night, but the four-day week of work is a movement that is worthy of the overall industrial wisdom of the party, not to be reimbursed.
The Liberian Party is not the first group to confirm such a picture, but in 2017, the Green Party promised a four-day weekly election.
However, the Liberian party as a whole is not confirming this picture.
One translator of the Liberian party said that the four-day weekly party is not a party and is not a party.
The President of the House of Commons, Mr. McDonald, used the last week's Leber Conference to present his idea of turning the socialist into a myth.
Mr. McDonald said they are trying to get back power from 'unseen designers' and 'fucking food' in the U.S. farm.
It also means that the current Sherhalders in water companies will not be able to return their full share because the Liberian government is able to do the "catts" because of the alleged wrong act.
They also confirmed the plans to establish a collective political fund to include workers in the company's boards and to assign 10 per cent of the new population's income to employees, from which workers will receive an annual wage of £500.
The Dutch team, the soul of Canada, says "60 minutes" about whether the investigation against the cable of the FBI will change their minds.
A study of FB's claims against the GBKWO's claims has been delayed for less than a week in the Supreme Court for their independence, and the question is whether the Bureau's studies will force some Republican senators to return their support.
In an interview published in Tatar, the book "60 Minutes" by the Secretary-General of the Republican Senators of Canada and the London Group asked if the FBI would find something that would encourage them to change their minds.
Canadian South Carolina has seen more babies than she does.
And Canada said, "I mean, indeed."
I talked about going in. I talked to Jag Kawano.
And I called upon Qarun after the news had come to me, and said: What is it that you have done?
They were in a state of stress, and two (concentrations) and two (concentrations) of cascade.
However, there was no clue in the Gremian Empire.
They said they're losing their view of Brit Kawano and they're going to need a dynamic charge to change it.
I don't know what happened with Dr. Ford, but I'm sure you know that Brit had changed his temper. They were pointing to Christine Blassi Ford.
No one can believe what they call a name.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see any big changes.
What's the Global Sitting Festival, and what's it doing to reduce poverty?
This week, New York will host a New York Global Site Festival, which will be the annual anniversary of the music in which many famous gladiators express their own thoughts and thus affect it; the end of the world's greed.
In their seventh year, thousands of people will be gathered in the Gretland of Central Park in the Global Positioning Festival not only to be satisfied with the globalization of Gentt Jackson, Cardie B and Shands, but also to warn of its real goal to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Sites Festival, which was expanded by the Global Poverty Project in August 2012, is a leading international audience that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of people working effectively against poverty.
A simple token for this message (if you want to get a VIP tag is a different thing), the Consortium Shackins are going to complete some tricks or "actual" such as volunteer work, e-mailing a world leader, calling a phone call, or other specific steps to make a warning about the end of poverty.
But how successful is the Global Positioning to achieve its goal when it's only 12 years old now?
Is there a real reason to direct people to take action, or is there another form of "Calcticism", in which people think they're writing on online packages or sending a tweet doing a lot of work?
Global Positioning says since 2011, he has recorded 19 million "actual" of his colleagues for various purposes."
It says that these actions have made the world public more than $37 billion in proclaiming promises and policies that will improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people from 2030 to 2025.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 promises and declarations generated by its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been collected or collected.
The group estimates that the funds received have already affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some important promises include The Power of News, which is a partnership of government officials and executives in Britain, and it seeks to "help children to cope with their full potential". She promised to provide $35 million to help end the hunger in Rwanda after the global situation had reached 4,700 tweets.
In April 2018, The Power of the News Secretary Trissi Minin told a lawyer in London that with the help of the British Government, the U.S. government, national governments and, like you, the global situation, we can make the lack of food injustice a story of the past.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 requests for better food for mothers and children from Britain, the government announced a project, a power of the News, to provide funds, under which there is a need for food to provide 5 million food and children.
One question on your website is, "What makes you think we can end poverty seriously?"
Global Citizens said it's a long and difficult journey - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like movements against civil rights and racial crime, we're successful, because we're more powerful together.
About this year in New York, some of those who represent their own fans include Janet Jaxen, Weekend, Shan Mandis, Cardie Bei, and Geneleel Mona, who will be represented by Debora, France, and Ho Ho Jack.
The U.S. can use its own tank for the blackhead to convert Russian power outputs.
The U.S. Secretary-General of the United States has discovered, as Washington Ogzaminer reported, that "if necessary" Washington's Russian forces use its sea to prevent access to the East and the Middle East.
The woman claimed that it was a lie to seek new powers of Russian occupation in the evening. Russia's government is the head of the country at the invitation of the government of the evening.
They said, "I think it's because of their presence in the Middle East, as they do in Eastern Europe, which is the southern part of Europe.
And they have a way and a way to meet him.
They said, "The government has the ability to make sure that the sea remains open and, if necessary, shut them down so that they do not reach their limits."
Women's kanzemmers were talking about an approach organized by the British Alliance, a non-profit charity group that describes itself as "the voice of power users" in the United States.
They measure the wisdom of Washington's operation to remove Russia and Iran and are affected by it.
They gave Russia a "scaring car" on the wall of their property on the wall. They said about Iran and Russia: "It's a relatively small and very small wall on the wall and replace it."
These comments are presented at a time when the tramp system is responsible for increasing Europe's capacity to take place in Russia, which is more difficult for European users.
In this regard, the Trump Administration's official cover is trying to direct the Germans, Mr. Donald Tramp, to join the "Inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipe line, which has made Berlin "Serious" of Moscow, according to the tropics.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the North Stream of 11 billion dollars is a 2-pecker line, which will double the current pipe line and lead to 110-billion-major metrics, a rather economic plan.
Cremlan has found that the strong opposition to the project of Washington is only on the basis of economic reasons and is an example of an unconstitutional balance.
In September, after meeting with the U.S. Power Secretary of State of Moscow, Alexander Nowak, a Russian authority, said, "I believe that the power should not be used as an instrument for increasing pressure and that users should be able to select suppliers.
Germany has been in a state of shock for the United States, and the project is reimbursing its independence from the project.
The first German business organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said to the United States that they had been separated from the two sides of the AY's powerful police and Berlin and Moscow.
The chief editor of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor and Russian President Walder Patten, he said that I feel very bad when a third country is in the supply of our power.
Mexico City's Senator Al-Zabehi says he'll "look back" to participate in the presidential election in 2020
Senator Zabehet of Massachusetts said that after a middle-term election, he would "swiftly think" about participating in the high-ranking election.

Paul called his arrest "undefiled hand in the army," and said about his sons and other combatants: "They come back a little different, they come back a little hard, they come back, they think that what they, their fellow soldiers and Iran, and all the rest of the army, are going back to the country, whether it is worth it or not."

18 Support for the Police in the New Defense of D.C.
U.S. government and District of Colombia have refused to protect people who have fled from hunger or domestic violence.
The U.S. News reported that the representatives of the U.S. government and the D.R. requested the House to cooperate with justice in Thailand by the police in Washington, D.C.
Grace vs. Sessins, president of the U.S. City Rights Union in August, I was not shown the full name of the case.
He said his partner and "the sons of his violent gang" were angry with him, but U.S. allies rejected his request for protection on 20 July.
He was taken into custody in Texas.
The government's supporters of Grace have made El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala a country that creates the largest demand for American protection because they face the major problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US security police 2014 is against the decision of the Board of Emigrant Appeals, which allowed the non-registered Turkish country to flee from domestic violence.
Dr. Of Colombia's Atternal General Carl Resen told the House in a statement that the new police "response the government, the public and the national law"
The request for cooperation with justice is said to require that the decision of all asylum applications be taken on the basis of facts and circumstances, and this is contrary to this principle.
The complainant further argued that the police that prevented Turkey's entry into the country have been damaged by the American economy because they can become workers and can provide "the necessary Liberians"
In June, the International General Jeff Sischens ordered the American geese to refrain from giving any further protection to those who fled from domestic violence and gang violence.
Sischens announced on June 11 that protection is available only to those who leave their country because of ethnic, religious, ethnic, or any particular political group or fear of the construction of the Esarsian country.

The U.S. Spherical China's "propagand adjectives" claim to "dangerous"
A week after the sale of a four-page deal between the U.S. and China, a Chinese newspaper reported on China, the U.S. Suffer claimed to use the US press to spread propaganda on Beijing.

The claim of the storm that Beijing is trying to intervene in US elections by Washington is a new way of increasing pressure on China, as U.S. contractors have told Reuters.
While it is a matter for non-governmental governments to promote trade, there is a serious trade war between Beijing and Washington, where they announced several races on the arrivals of the other side of the river.
Chinese and American experts say China's response to the war was to set targets for those who came up in the states that supported the Trip's Republical Party, such as Ivo.
In China, former long-term Governor of the United States of America and the IAA and a major producer of agricultural products, Terry Brenstead said that Binging has damaged American workers, individuals and businesses.
Brenstead wrote in a statement in the Tatar Dice Munice Register that China is pursuing propagandistic alliances in our free press and is increasing its threat.
Brenstead wrote that the Chinese government is putting great emphasis on the right to freedom of every expression of freedom and freedom of expression in the U.S. government.
On the other hand, you can hear limited voices against the government in the new state in the streets in China, and you will not see the real picture of Chinese people's perceptions about China's disturbing social policy, because the media is in the hands of the Communist Party.
He added that one of China's most famous news reports had made the offer of distributing their articles, but they didn't tell him what it was.
The prosecutors have warned that the Republican Kawanus case has turned the Soviet Walters away before the medium-term elections.
As many of the Republicans are protesting against a number of allegations of sexual harassment, the sponsors have warned them that they will face their reaction in the medium-term elections, especially by the Soviet Union.
The emotions are higher than that, and more Republicans have shown pleasure that they want to think about it.
A professor of political sciences at the Mexico Will School of the University of Syracuse told The Hall that you can't ignore these things for a week.
He said they don't believe that in the last time of Senator Jeff Flick (Arishona), the demand for an AF will be enough to satisfy the ill-fated parents.

But these feelings can be even higher, especially in addition to the Sunny Wutters and Young Wutters, 18-29-year-olds, who often don't vote because they don't like the author.
Prior to Ford's public testimony, in which they gave details of the allegations of sexual harassment against the Sperm Court, the complainants had agreed that it would be a serious reaction if the Republican authorities decided to continue.
According to this B.C.News, Cheermen Michael Steele, former of the Republical National Committee in the beginning of last week, said that this has become an idea for J and P.
Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the New Channel that the issue is not only about the committee's vow or the ultimate vow or coming to Kawanut, but also about how the Republicans dealt with the issue and how they dealt with it (Kristen).
However, after Ford and Kawanut's testimony, it turns out that the Americans have lost whom to believe, when the last comment is of little benefit.
YouGov's new Paul showed that 41 people really believe the testimony of Ford, or maybe they think it's true, when 35 percent said they're true or maybe they're true.
Worse yet, 38 percent said they think that Kawano had lied or probably lied during the witness, when only 30 percent said that about Ford.
The Georgian reported that after Flick's request, the FBI is investigating allegations made by at least one other accused of Diborah Ramirez.
Ford said in front of the Senate's judicial committee that Kawano had been violent with him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argued that Nassad Jae had shown his admiration during a party in July 1980 for the Sprim Court.
A program to start a new Internet against Google and Facebook in the World Wide Web context.
A new Internet initiative is being launched against the popular Tom Brenners Google, Amazon and Facebook Web.
The latest Inrupt project in the technology legend is a company based on the open Surs Plat Farm Sold of Brenners.
Sold lets users know where their data is stored and how much information they can access.
In a special interview with Fascist company, Brenners said in a joke that Inrupt's purpose is "World Victory"
They said to him, "We will still do it."
It's a long story.
This allows people to create their own online data show or a POD technology.
It includes the list of contacts, the list of tasks, the calendar, the music library and other private and leading tools.
It's like Google running, Microsoft Ot Lek, Sleek and Sceptifi are available on a browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the online data show is that the user has the ability to get information about what kind of information you can get.
The company calls it "depends on data"
Inrupt, according to the company's AO, is the image of Inrupt, which combines tools, methods and skills to make available to everyone.
At the time, the company was purchased by Bruce, the IBM, as a security platform, including some on-site dealers, and a component of the volunteer coders, who were set up to operate on the project.
This week, technology dealer Inrupt web sites around the world can make their decentralised apps using access tools.
Brenner said that they and their team are talking to Fis Bike and Google, if there's a complete change in which all business models are thrown out at night.
"We do not ask permission from them.
In a post published on the media on Sunday, Brennersley wrote that Inrupt's "Mission Control Power and a Ecosystem that helps to protect the safety and quality of the new website created on the sun."
Brenner Lee was changed on the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, a voice has been voiced in the debate on the non-participation of the Brenner Lee network.
Even when Inrupt is released, the authors of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute will continue to be the editors and directors.
Brenner Lee added that they're more optimistic about the future of the web than the future.
Bernard van: A lecture in the honour of a priest who received a Victorian course in the first century of the Great War
During the first great war, a church of England's clergy, one of Victoria's winners, was held in their father's palace 100 years ago.
Lieutenant Colonel Lord Bernard Van received this prize on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Balinglais and Lahocort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a gunman and he was never aware that he had won the highest rank in the British army.
On Sunday, in the Narthamptonshire area of Randin, two of her grandsons passed the memorial stone during a parade.
One of them, Michael Van said, "It's a great sign" that the stone appeared only 100 years after its discovery.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Cornel Van took his battalion by the water of the De Saint-Content River "in high heat and field and machine power.
Later, he grew up on the Faring Line and was playing a field song alone, and spent three more minutes in front of his line with the "greatest violence" before he was seriously injured.
Lieutenant Cornel Wan died only a month before the end of the war on 4 October 1918.
He said 72-year-old Michael Van said that his father's employees are the ones he could never complete, but he was an independent national service.
After Preed, he and his brother, Dr. James Van, raised flowers in the garden of the British Wood Ampel Joth Band.
Michael Van said they feel honored to participate in the party and say, "The demonstration of a hero's violence is from a lot of people."
The night of the M.M.'s visit to see a 206-year-old waitress, instead of getting the pope.
Imagine that you're going all night to see a bit of a city, Balator 206 just because you're banned from the headquarters unit.
There were 13 matches in the case of Hosse, where there were six matches on the Mencard, which were shown in Britain at the end of the night on the 5th channel.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, as the curator Mosessey and Rory Mike Downland were preparing to meet each other, the authorities in Britain denied when the Korean pope was transformed into a political party.
And there were some people who came to him in the morning, unheeding.
On Twitter, one of the Shakins has become "a sort of stupid joke" to move on children's cards.
When asked about the publication, Deputy Secretary Dio Schwartz of the Marketing and Conduct Senator of Balatur said that the government had the right to have no such material available for the 6th session, so they had to move to the children's program.
Yeah, "Pip-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d
Balatur's company's president, Cocker, said he's working on his system for the future to include Britain's supervisors.
Koker said, "I think when we think about the rain, I think we might be able to solve it.
But there's six in the morning, and we're not going to be able to spread it by noon, by their time.
But we're working on it.
Make sure that when this was changed, many text messages were received, and not all of them were friends.
We're trying to focus on it, we think it's a huge loss.
But it wasn't, but it was a government issue.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to meet five, but instead of six -- as we're doing, we're going to try to make the jokes easier, and we can't do that.
It's a sad situation.
The D.I.L.D.D.: Tom Dale felt that because of his character, he was able to become a 'comter'
Ummpic Diary Tom Deller says he grew up with a sense of complacency because of his character -- but he urged him to be a successful man.
Twenty-four-year-old Tom said he didn't feel until he went to high school and said, "Everyone wasn't like me."
Speaking on the Larynn Lawrence's D.A.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D., they told others that they were talking about the rights of our species.
They said they were careful about winning the Olympics because of being a father.
For a long time, the regular president of Shoe Christy Young has been beaten for months because of illness.
In a run-up to the program before Lauron, Delle said that she grew up with the feeling that she was "more" than everyone, because it was not acceptable for boys and girls."
He said, until today, feelings of lowness and differentity gave me strength and skill to succeed.
He said he wanted to prove that he was "little" because he didn't trust anyone when he finally learned about his nature.
Two times in the Olympics, the winner of the win-win race has become an LGBT worker, and this year he has come from more countries to promote ethnicism in Australia.
He said, “He is speaking clearly, because he feels good for himself, that he was able to enjoy life without consequences, and he wants others to hope.”
A three-time World Championship said that it was a surprise for a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, to be in love with him.
Dileen married a 20-year-old, Ashker Edward, but she never had a difference of age.
He said, "When you were so young, when you had to go through such things -- she went to Olympex for the first time in 14 years, and her father died three years later -- he said that it was difficult to find someone of his age who had seen so much higher down.
The couple in June were the parents of a boy named Robert Black-Delle and Delle said he changed his outlook on his life.
He said, "If you had spoken to me last year, I would certainly have preferred everything to gold."
Do you know that the gold medals of the Olympics are greater than winning?
The glory of my lamp's gold is ruby.
Her son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 from brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daily said he didn't accept that he was dying and the last thing he asked was whether they were cut for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the next row.
He said, "I didn't tell them you won't be able to live in the next row.
He said, “I seized their hand when it reached the last time, and I stayed with them until it was too late, and I accepted that they were not unjust.”
The following year, Dile took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the Songs.
He said that I knew only that I had a dream of living for him -- to hang in front of a Olympic Games, and there was nothing better than that.
He also urged the selection of his previous taste -- from the hot summer to the proud - that kept in his mind during the preparation of the Olympics, and still has its color on it.

The Ot's Farmese was added to the week in the Reader's Cup
The U.S. F. F. M.A. will set up a record when they play their 47-side radar chips, but they will have to return their farm to avoid the establishment of an unfathomable stone.
McClintocks, who play 12 times each month in the face of every six months, which is a record, are added on the day of the week to be fresh and fresh.
Instead of becoming the focus of people's attention, which is often for the United States, five times the winner of the five major champion champion has divided his day into a chain leader and to work on his music to remove his weaknesses.
They can't even throw the right gift in their career, so they're not suitable for the 48-year-old golf training course, where the long-distance country pays a severe penalty for the error of Shats.
And even though the course isn't so hard on itself, Tawara will be with the top of the champions in the ninth match, with the top of the champions of France, who spent their lives this week with the bane Tommy Fleet Wood.
If the Americans who lose four pounds at the start of the 12-inch match, they start the exam, it can actually be important to confirm the score of the college.
Fürk expressed confidence in his escape.
He said, "He's got a good idea of his work today. He buried my back and put his hands around me and said, "He'll be ready for dinner."
He has full trust in himself.
He's a host of welcome, and he gave them a lot this week.
I probably didn't imagine she'd play two games.
I was more surprised than that, but what was going to be was, and maybe we thought so.
Like each other, he wants to be in the field.
He'll play the Tatar and record the greatest radar cap game in the good Faldo.
It may end her radar coffee career, but it doesn't match her individual record heights.
McClane has been successful 18 times, 20 times failed and seven times equal to the score (halves), although Fürk said his presence paid a lot for the team.
He explained that he's a fan, a tennis player, a rocker, he likes to hang out with people, and he's a teammate's soul.
I think young girls are enjoying it, and it's been a great week.
There's a lot more to do than play.
European hats know that the big lion will soon be gone.
European Cypriots know from their experience that the radar can change with great ease during the final day's competitions.
The Danish team launched its career in Vedrama in 1997, in which a team in the capital of Sio Balstrous received more than five cents on the US, but they succeeded in reaching the final line with very difficult injuries from 141⁄2-131/2.
He said, "You remind yourself that we had a great lion in the woods, we had a big lion in the Brook Line, where we were defeated and we lived in the woods, but with a very few maryans.
So history told me and everyone in the team that the case was not over yet.
They go to the field today with complete preparation.
where they will go and make all things go straight.
The word will not end until you have reached the end of the board.
We have a goal, and it's to survive the traffic, and our focus is on it all.
I always said, "I focus on the 12 sides of my side, but we know very well that on the other hand, it's from the best angles in the world.
I'm glad you're working on a hard golf course, Brian said more; I've never speeded up in it.
We'll have a different call tomorrow.
There'll be all the individual actions that will appear, and that's a different thing to do.
When I'm a designer, it's great to be in the field with a partner, but when you're alone there, then you're tested for your full intelligence as a golfer.
This is the message that you are fully prepared to prepare the dishes and benefit from their full wisdom.
Now you leave your partner behind, and you're going to show him all your skills.
On the contrary, anti-Biren's anti-Birth Number Führerk expects to show a fairer hand in the face of their peers, Masoua Jordan Spitath and Jotten Thomas, who raised three percent of the four.
Fürk himself stood on the two fronts of these unexpected changes on the last day, after becoming part of the Fatah Team in Brooklyn, he had to face the defeat when the European team got the "Media's Curtain."
When she was asked how she was treated as a coffeeman in 1999, she said, "I remember every word she gave me."
We're going to have 12 important matches, but you're going to want to get to that speed, as you saw in the Brooklyn line, as you saw in the media.
When he's on one side of the scale, he puts a lot of pressure on the scales.
We reorganize our lines according to it, and we keep our rings in the measure that we'll show some kind of magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been commissioned to condemn the attack in response, and in contrast to him, he will be with Rory McClaraire and Paul Howie, Hutton Day, John Road, Tommy Fleet Wood and Inn Potter and Lenin will be with other Europeans in his camp.
Burner said about his gambling transactions, "I put my balls in this order, because I think it's about the whole game.
A new German warship once again met
Germany's new president of the beach was to be reduced in 2014 to the location of ships off the Black War, but it will not be until the next year. According to local media, this is due to a lack of systems and equipment.
According to a military translation, D. Z.A. reported that the first of the presidents of the New Baden-Württemberg class was now scheduled to be commissioned by the Ryan Land Falls.
The ship was to be joined by the sea in 2014, but after Delery's serious problem, the first project was lost.
The four ships of the Baden-Watermberg class, which were awarded by the Lord Barry in 2007, will take the place of the former Bremen Class's president.
It is thought that these ships will have a powerful impact on the ships such as the remote radar, the interface and the sound equipment, which will have access to hidden information in addition to the sea-shade and sea-shake masks.
Other important features include the longest session of Mainnis -- the latest president can be held from his father's castle for up to two years.
However, D. Zhett has indicated that the latest warships will soon make them a target before they enter the service. It is said that they will be able to demonstrate their strength by the sea.
Less than half of the F125 refugees came to the six-year-olds when the German Navy refused to decommission the ship normally and sent it back to Bloom & Wass Shep Yard in Hamburg.
It's been the first time that the beach has returned a ship after Delaire.
There was little information about the reasons for this return, but the German media referred to the "Spathy Weir and Hardware Multi-Mercy" that would make the warship useless if it was assigned to the war machine.
The cover of the software was particularly important because the Baden-Wurtberg class ships were only operating 120 cylinders - about half of the individual strength available on former Bremen Class ships.
It also came to the view that the sea was much more than the size of the ship, which limits its operation to reduce the capacity to include up-to-date flights in the future for the sea and for the future.
It is estimated that 7,000 tons of land land land was used by the Germans in the second Great War.
In addition to the lack of hardware, training of the entire project's integrated content has also become a problem.
It is said that its flow is greater than the first 2.2 billion euros of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) and has reached the drinking level.
The importance of the new Pharets in the face of the problem is now growing in the light of Germany's ongoing sea force.
At the beginning of this year, President Hans Peter Battals of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament admitted that less ships could be assigned to the sea.
The contractor said that in time this problem was serious, because the former vessels were destroyed, but their new vessels were not provided.
They expressed their regret that there was no platform in the Baden-Wurtberg class that could not be included in the beach.
Inquiring the secret life of Nessanol Tristo's cells
The purpose of a new research on a satellite Heilands is to find out how the spiders use the ability to search for food.
It is hoped that its results will bring new light to the behavior of these marine animals and provide guidance for future conservation efforts.
By the scientists of the NESF, scientists in the U.S.R. include large-coloured and low-coloured deaf ears and doublings in a research study in Ontario Gardens in Usterres, U.S.A., and Sparrow Papis Trilis.
Full-time special records will be placed on major locations throughout the region in order to capture the heat of the trains.
This program will run on a mobile server using the Handheld Manager and the Handheld Manager.
The performance of all recordings will reveal the frequency and frequency of the wave of explosions.
In order to prepare a detailed picture of their behavior, the plans and reports of the group will be prepared.
The Council of Power Protection for the TSE expressed its hope that the results would show which country of the group is the most important and how they are used for all kinds of events.
This information will help to set up a new millennium for summers and related events and determine the benefits of maintaining forests.
During the past century, there has been a decline in the population of the stars in Scotland and Britain.
Their lives are threatened by construction and development, which affects their citizens and the population.
In addition to air traffic and lighting, they are at risk of being attacked by chemicals of paper and plastic material.

They said there's a great place for the stars in Treve.
We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good farm.
But there are many things they can't know about the stars yet, so what we're doing here or elsewhere will help us understand what they need to do for their development.
They insisted that in buildings, it was necessary to identify the stars before the activity of Mainnes, because it is possible that up to 400 mothers and children could be destroyed by the destruction of a wound.
The arrows are protected and it is illegal to destroy them, to threaten them, or to harm them or to destroy them.

Relating the allegations of sexual violence by Ronaldo when German citizens are taking the lead against the country
Christina Lolado has set up a 'voice news' of sexual violence against himself and said that people want to know his name by using it.
Her clients will take the lead against the Germans, the Germans, and the Spanishs who spread accusations.
A U.S. wife, Kathreen Mee-Yorgo, claimed that in 2009 the American city of Las Vegas, Portugal, was recapitalated in a hotel.
Dr. Spygel reported to the House that Ronaldo was accused of giving Kathreen $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident.
After a few hours of reporting the call, Instagram Leo radio spoke with his 142 million followers, and 33-year-old Loladen turned the news on as a "voice news".
He said, "No, no, no, no."
Five times, Boon D and Phatah told the camera that what they said was "voice news."
They want to be known using my name.
It's about business.
They want to know my name, but that's what happens in such things.
Laughing, he added, "I'm a happy man, and everything's going well.
According to Ratters, Rolando's attorneys are preparing to take the lead in the Der Spigel, which they have set up "regarding concerns in the life-threatening community".
WKEL KRISCHEN STATZ said, "Rollado will call for the removal of the most serious damage to themselves, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the event took place in Los Vegas in June 2009 in a room in Palms Hotel and Casino.
According to a paper posted at the Clarke District Court in Nevada, following a visit to a nout club, Ronald and I returned to the city hall, where he apparently had a sexual abuse with him.
I claimed that Ronaldo sat next to him after the accident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good man" but he was hit by the hands of "one hundred bad."
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that he has established sexual relations, but he has been willing to do so.
I also claimed that he went to the police and took pictures of his bones in the hospital, but later he agreed to correct outside justice because he was "dangerous about criminal activity" and was afraid of public humiliation.
At the age of 12, I've been told that she wants to finish this cleaning because she's in the hospital trauma because of the accident.
In the event of the attack, Ronaldo Minchester Union was going to join the Reil Medrid, and this time he moved to the student club Juve with a 100 million euros contract in the summer.
Bright: "We're going to be sorry" by the size of British investors.
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that Britain "We'll regret it" if it loses its impact on the post-Brigset community.

Touto's leading director Maron Kuck said, "My point is, if you leave the AY at the end of the British March, you'll have a creative break in our factory.
The other British companies including Honda, BIM Deblio and Jacuar Land Roor have shown their support for leaving the AY without a contract.
For example, BIM Dibleo says he will close his private planet in Oxford for a month after Bridget.
Consumers say there are more health risks in non-Del's blogs than in China.
Twitter's propaganda line is based on "time-to-time preparation", where parties from both Britain and the U.S. Splaires arrive every 37 minutes.
If March 29 comes out of the AY without a D, it can be cross-border, which can be slow or slow in providing a party.
The company says it will not be possible to have more than one day's price in its fearful share planet for Twitter, so it will have to shut down the plant.
Mr. Clark said, "Thirissa has been prepared to protect me from these dangers for the future with my EYO."
We're going to have a deal. They told the TV program on BBS Radio 4 that we want a better part that will bring us together in the present situation, but we'll benefit fully from it.
Not only Twitter but another minifixer's testimony is that we will be able to keep our high-performance Chinese in full.
Twitter was rather short of telling how long the plant would be stopped, but it was reported that in the long term, more than the planet would be down in the balance of the planet and the work would eventually be affected.
Peter Sussores, who has been working in Burundi for 24 years, and the United Nations Conner on planet, said they're very worried about it: in my experience, they'll never get back when they're done.
A government translationman said: "We have presented a correct and reliable plan for our future with EYO.

Some reporters will repeat this claim: the synders did not have a press briefing in White House since 10 September.
The mayor of the church asked why.
Sanders said, "Even if a few of the Brifings were not the cause of the disfavors, but I won't deny the fact that they think so."
Then they suggested that there would be a direct link between the storm and the press.
And they say, "Indeed, those who came before us are in greater error than those who were before them. Indeed, we have seen their number."
Sanders said, "Breefings will still be, but if you have an opportunity to ask the American author straight questions, it would certainly be better to talk to me about it.
We're trying hard to do this, and you've seen us doing this in the last few weeks, and when you talk to the U.S. government, it's going to take the place of press briefings.
When allowed by the White House, they ask regularly when they share with the public session or the press conference.

One South Korean lawmaker said that there was a decrease in the number of displaced people going to South Korea seven years ago.
Park Bening Siege, referring to the data from South Korea's U.S. Department of Education, said there were 1,127 missing last year - the number was 2,706 in 2011.

How the U.S. and China's Trade War will benefit China

More than six million people living in the country are in need of human assistance.
