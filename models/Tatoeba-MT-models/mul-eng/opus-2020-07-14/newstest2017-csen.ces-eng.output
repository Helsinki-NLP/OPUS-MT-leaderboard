Eight-year-old chief of the dead in the San Francisco store
The eight-year-old chief who recently moved to San Francisco was a local store shop this week.
But the victim says that he doesn’t care who wants to hurt him, and he adds: “It’s finally started to hurt him. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall in the middle of the morning was identified as an eight-year-old citizen of San Francisco Frank Galicia, who introduced the office of a judge.
The French police department reported that it was a violent death and was conducting investigations.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said Frank, who was formerly a regular cook in Boston, got his excellent job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The speech restaurant Sons & Daughters said his death was "crushed and destroyed".
"We have a small team that works as a family partner. It's going to miss us very much," said the speaker.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and beliefs belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia pointed out that Frank first slept in the apartment, but recently he “started to give it to him."
"You found a place, you went with a girl," said Louis Galicia to the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't belong to anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to associate with his family, he always fed us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take any chances.
He was a brother who took things the way they are.
"Even if all the others in the world were wrong, he was a harmless diamond that attacked every day," he said.

The Czech dragons invested more than 31 billion vehicles in modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, public transport has invested more than 31 billion kroner to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently air-conditioning, and half of the trains have a new closed WC system.
The amounts for modernization in individual years with the exception of 2012.
In the last six years, the Czech dragons invested more than 31 billion kroner in modernization.
A third of the vehicles are currently air-conditioning, and half of the trains have a new closed WC system.
The money generated appeared in the reduction of average age for two years in trucks and private units and for six years in classic cars.
Most of the investment provided transport to regional transport, with 60 per cent of the money shown, and 40 per cent of the company invested in the reconstruction of long-distance vehicles.
The average old truck and the unit is currently 19 years old.
Modernised older vehicles, however, are considered as a whole new.
If modernization of vehicles is not calculated, the average age of old-fashioned vehicles would increase by 10 years.
Some older people are in the middle of a personal wagon whose average age at the start of modernization is 23 years old.
If the average age of these vehicles were to be taken into account only a year after the date of production, it would be 33.4 years.
Classic fittings consisting of wagons and motorized vehicles, however, in recent years from the Czech and global railways are progressively mixed and are restored by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, there were 280 to 223 buses, similar to the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the half of the year.
The carrier was particularly engaged in old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to June, the transporter left 110 of these vehicles out of circulation.
From the investment in the vehicle park, which is planned to be implemented in the near future, it is possible to introduce, for example, 50 cars for speed up to 200 km per hour, which the carrier plans to install at the Praha - Bratislava - Budapest International Line, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the Turkish Highway.
The contract shall be calculated by selecting up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical unit.
The authorities know about illegal advertising in the fourth year, they can't get rid of it.
We're just powerless, they admit.
For the fourth year, online edition of the present.cz follows the story of the billboard in southern Czechs, which now loves motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a tourist interest in the roots of the trees, but also an Olympic park.
The administrators know they're fine, but they're saying they can't do anything about it.
Similar ads are hundreds, maybe thousands, all over the country.
According to officials, there is a court law on wine, which does not allow illegal mobile billboards to be removed immediately.
They need a complex bureaucratic package.
But the company changes the name and the office is short on it.
Or it's enough for the advertising to take a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The leader of the train and the distance four years ago acknowledged: in the main mind of the Czech Budějovic in Lipno, the advertising billboard is on our ground in the state train.
Even three months, however, officials were not prepared to release unauthorized transport structures with the right inert plate.
It wouldn't seem to anyone that they're standing right next to the vehicles, in a ten-metre protective dog where there's nothing to do about safety.
Drivers claim that billboards can't be easily consulted because of the expensive law.
You need to put it on and take it away.
"We can't just let it happen," says the spokesman of the Railway and the farthest Nina Ledvinov, referring to a complex bureaucratic package that the removal of the billboard has to proceed according to the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose judgment started online at the moment.cz in detail to follow on the race, is not unique and points to a general problem that cannot be resolved effectively and quickly by the authorities.
Only in the southern Czechs did the editor count the dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules closely next to or near the vehicle.
There are other countries in the same way.
"We have a problem with the companies to remove refugees," the head of the Committee of Transport of the Czech Republic's National Authority, Jírí Klassa, whose colleagues have solved similar stories.
According to the Class, it's a expensive law that officials agree on.
First of all, the owner of the billboard must make a statement in order to make it go away.
Only the chief firm is often inadequate or knows the fine that has already been described in the past when the problem has started to be more detailed: enough mobile station with advertising to accommodate a couple of meters and officials may face the challenge of removing the black hole into the hair.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone fails to agree with it and its co-ordinator immediately, it is considered to be a new device and we have to explain it again," explains Jiri Klas.
The new law can't help.
The change could bring about a new law which, from the beginning of the next year, would prohibit billboards in the distance and limit them to road I.
Critics point out that rules to suppress illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as ever.
And the authorities don't care.
Companies can continue to build tens of millions of dollars per year on illegal premises and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard hanging on Lipno belongs to the Commerz Billboard company.
Officials know it well: the Czech borough Master of it currently conducts three administrative arrangements for the planned billboards.
The company is at risk in each management of a 30-year trial.
It is more about advertising that has been put without permission in the protective dog of Class I.
Management is not over, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Committee of Transport of the Cheskobudjevic Magistrate.
The claim, which is currently concerned, does not yet represent the network between these cases, but soon with the highest likelihood of arrival.
According to the RDD, Nina Ledvin's company did not respond to repeated written requests for removal, and the case would be made on the table by the national and then most likely by the Magistrate officials.
The Commerz Billboard company belongs to those suspicious companies that cannot contact.
He doesn't need the mail and the official seat on Žizkov has been broken more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company went to the southern business of Anton Fischer, who had been severely opposed by the head of the Czech representative of Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard is located on the market from Billboard and offers it to investors, but in the past he refused any connection.
At the end of the year, when the ESD began to take an interest in advertising on Lipno, Fischer allowed state officials to send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where a new firm is definitely sitting.
Not one of these addresses has been called to the administrators today.
It's a terrible fight.
Similar swelling or invisible changes in the seat are not uncommon.
One firm we gave a couple of years ago accounts for two million kroner.
She just changed her name and ICHO and it didn't work out.
The executor returned the case, the ads continued, maybe elsewhere.
We're against similar companies and their business practices are weak enough.
It's like a war with windmills, recognizing anonymity as one of the officials.
No one's ever solved the new law in this regard.
Currently.cz spoke to several Members who had a problem.
They haven't had any activity yet.
On the contrary, the Members who wanted to extend the term for the preservation of billboards in the main Czech communications appeared.
The government has stopped it.
Billboards are not only for the whole country, but also for national and present policies very sensitive and sometimes challenging.
On the one hand, he knows about the social demand after their restrictions, on the other hand, he needs himself because of intrusions in the preliminary campaigns.
I don't give up the thought that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.
Farmers are less green this year, but more fish and milk are studying statistics.
According to the Czech statistical authority, the average annual harvest rate will be 6.7 per cent lower than the moon.
However, the annual rate exceeds the average over the last five and ten years.

The farmers then moved it to more fields.
However, the lower hectar output, which falls to 6.04 tonnes, is signed on the floor.
The sum of the five-fold decline of statistics is expected to be in the iron chain, which is most commonly used for beer production.
Reduced levels represent a 15.2 per cent reduction in personal space, but also a lower hectar output.
On the contrary, the eggs are 6.3 percent higher.

This year, the farmers sent him 35,543 hectares.
By 2008, when the cat in Czech had grown on record 70,000 hectares, the field was half.
As a result of the expansion of personal space, the annual circle of the mother's mother will be richer.
It's about 2.5 per cent to 27,423 tons.
The hectar output, but it's going to be 6.1 percent lower.
Two men were accused of assaulting a knife and a catacomb, the court sent him to jail.
The police accused two attackers who were attacked by a knife and a five-year-old man in the middle of Olomouce.

The two obvious suspects were kept by the police immediately after the attack.
The applicant submitted a proposal to the court to take them into custody, and the court informed him on Friday.
Both men are under three to ten years of imprisonment.
The police charged two arrests of a five-year-old man in the center of Olomouce with knife and sword.
His rivals caused him severe and severe injuries, and he ended up in the hospital.
The incident took place between the two groups of people who joined the police on Tuesday morning in the right Sunday at the Ministry of Freedom.
Pachatelles ended up in jail, informing the Polish police spokesman Marie Štrbák.
The group route between the two families was played in the garden area in front of the patriot bar in the centre of Olomouce.

The complainant submitted a proposal to the court to take them into custody, and the judge delivered to him on Friday, and the speaker added.
The macet was used in the centre of Olomouce during the mass battle of the attackers five years ago, it was then just ten meters away, before the Varna discotheque in Riegrov Street.

According to the police, they had knifes, needles and cats in their hands.
After two attacks, the Court of the Civics had been tortured by a conditioned torture.
Free and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you'll go around them every day.
One of the most critical examples of the unusable and empty house is the extensive construction of an existing IPB sild in the middle of the Señor Square.
That was supposed to work as a hotel for a long time.
It's still nothing.
That you need to set up a new and new apartment and office in the Metro?
And what about using existing, often valuable and protected architecture?
Right in the centre of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Václavska, there are a number of practical houses that, throughout their place, size and often and memory protection, are only empty and empty.
The property in the center we have selected with the help of the project Prazdnödomy.cz, which maps long-term empty property in the Czech territory.
Homes are usually the victims of the financial problems of their owners, invisible relationships between companies or belong to a State that cannot or does not want to be rescued.
There are more empty houses in Czech than homeless people.
If their owners pay a special fee, they want an initiative

Clinton's husband made $10.6 million.
The troops refuse to publish their tax recognition.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million in last year.
More than a million dollars were paid for Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton's revenue - more than six million dollars - is for their prints.
The trup of its tax admissions is refused.
The candidate for American Democrats at Hillary Clinton's presidency on Friday announced his tax statements, which increased pressure on his Republican opponent Donald Trumpa to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million in last year, notified the AP agency.
Most of Clinton's revenue - more than six million dollars - is due to their projections, and this is mainly from the period before the autumn of 2015, when Clinton launched his campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husband took a federal tax from the income tax of 34.2 per cent and then the tax from the income to the state and local level by nine per cent.
So they paid a total of 43.2 per cent of the income.
However, with a similar step, the Tempp has not yet agreed to publish the tax recognition.
There's a chance Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, he wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after publishing his confession.
Clinton is returning to the secret around Trump's revenue, other than to raise doubts as to whether her rival is really as rich as she claims, the AP agency has set up.

In Nigeria, the defense broke again.
Muslims from Boko Haram protected from further expectations and the doctors killed.
In Nigeria, cases of child abuse have again been reported.
In the northern part of the country, the government has announced an extraordinary expectation, since here two children have been charged with this incapacitated protection.
The vaccines brought the mussels there.
Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who protected the expectation and even killed doctors in the occupied areas.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was not observed.
In the northern part of Nigeria, there is an extraordinary waiting for children against the front, as two children were protected from this weakness.
In Africa, the defense was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that in the state of Borno, millions of children and four million others will be expected in the surrounding countries.
The Nigerian military guards on Friday, according to the AP agency, quickly supplied vaccines against children to the infected northern part of the country, where Muslim terrorists from Boko Haram.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that the virus in the area of many years has not been observed.
The extremists of Boko Haram in the past protected the expectation and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to get to the area where children were found.
Both of them arrived from the fragments from the part of Nigeria again released from Boko Haram.
The leader of the WHO section responsible for the translation of Michel Zaffran's BBC station said that waiting in Nigeria will start next week.
In the state of Borno, an Islamic radical group led to Boko Haram.
The region was made available by international organisations and government until the beginning of the year when Boko Haram was hit by a major deterioration in this part of the country.
The Nigerian Ministry of Health Isaac Adewole acknowledged that the new cases were a major deterioration in the country, because Nigeria wanted to announce that it had been banned for the next year.
WHO has warned that it is possible that although the disease has not been exposed for two years, it has spread among children.
The expected children are now under five years of age.
In 2012, Nigeria belonged to half of all cases around the world.
While it was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains only in three areas - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
The pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of the poor women.
Pope Frantishek met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from gang gang gangs.
The pope listened to their hard life stories and called for them to look to the future with confidence.
Frantishek wanted to warn this meeting of trafficking in people and call for the strengthening of the war against him.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes who released the police from the power of gang gangs.
The head of the Catholic Church for more than an hour listened to the stories of humble women and then called on her to look to the future with confidence, to introduce the speaker to the Vatican.
Among the former prostitutes who visited France were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were exposed to cruel physical violence during the forced prostitution.
The visitor wanted to draw attention to dealing with people and call for strengthening the fight against him, introduced the pope's speech.
Frantishek often warns of the fate of people at the end of society.
For example, on Thursday, for example, he met the Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican in depth and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France's gonna hit the jehadists.
Without the help of the Muslims, it won't go.
France is fighting radical Islam with the aid of Muslims themselves.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Vallse is making major changes in the functioning of the mix and spiritual education.
Since the late afternoon, we have closed 20 masses and prayed.
And the others will follow, the Minister has informed you.
In the country it works over a hundred jehadists.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be more difficult for France to guarantee that freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it is good to make sure that only those who have learned in France in the museums and in prayer can be taught.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from China to build new museums, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the country of the Persian Gulf.
And that's why they get into the mix, which can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is consistent with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key to achieving these objectives will be the new French Islamic delegation.
It should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
There's no money from the race.
In the country, the French gift for the island is now being established by the former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
She had already contributed to the review of financial flows between the towns and the countries to which their construction was financed.
Only the institutions soon started internal disputes and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," observed Valls recently.
At the French political scene, the debate on a new institution that does not pay for its non-functional burden was announced in January 2015 after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo newspaper.
They have all intensified further terrorist attacks in France, which, on behalf of the Islamic State, have led to the radicalisation of Islamists.
The French Minister inside Bernard Cazenev recently heard that a new assignment would be completed in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of blending from home resources and also to take into account our property.
At the same time, it is not clear where money will be taken not only to build new museums but also to various educational centres.
But a few suggestions are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or a meal tax.
In practice, the sellers would pay for food, which is to provide certification.
Some of these money would travel right into the donation box.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid to French immigrants who are going to Mexico.
Every year, they go there for a traditional course in South Arabia, which is about 30,000.
And that's not it.
According to the Prime Minister, only indicators that have passed special educational programmes at the French universities should be conducted in the future.
This should ensure that sanctions are in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mix.
The French government is at the same time fighting radicals.
And the others will follow, the Minister will soon be informed.
In France, there is no place for those who vote for hatred and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, according to estimates, there are approximately 2,500 mixed and praying.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are affected by radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have hosted a total of 80 persons, and in a number of other decades they consider this.
Not all of them, however, think that the steps of governments will be able to make a clear commitment to radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize do the same.
Not yet in the museums, young people are radicalized on the Internet, introduced by Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Research Centre.

Young Doctors Press: They Want fresh air in the area
The representatives of young doctors met to accept new steps in their dispute about a new treaty.
The Council of the Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full Council for support for further training activities from the start of the summer.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the issues concerning the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in Sweden voted against the refusal of a contract with BMA.
58 % of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members quoted on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC Ellen McCourt pointed out that the government remained "and still silent" on questions that were serious about the termination of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC's executive authority, in voting, has decided to completely cancel the proposed new contract and ask for a new formal meeting on all issues.”
In response to government complaints today, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to approving the current programme of the action taken from the start of the summer.
The team led young doctors year-olds to report to six stages, including the first general stages in the history of NHS.
The leader of the young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malavanaan, rejected the decision to terminate the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at the meetings before the vote of 54 000 young doctors and medical students said the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health said that the contract would mean a burden for medicines in England.
Russia and Turkey: the "insociable" Union?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The Russians and Turks met in the afternoon to sign their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long-term war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish opposition to the roof hall in Petrohrad, I had the idea that Ankara wants to complain more about this reconciliation.
It's on hand, yes.
But Putin didn't laugh, and a little bit of it blew out of him, and that's according to his reasonable standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke again about his "dear friend" Mr. Putinov - five times as one of the reports says.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their level before the crisis, but they will be even better.
Another day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
I think his superiors have expressed exactly the opposite.
But the persistent cold that came out of Putin showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: the shooting of the Russian warplane Turkey at the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow was rather harsh.
Putin broke his wounds around him and accused Ankaru of killing Moscow's knife in the back.
The offense was more about it than the thought of a friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild real trust, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
A state controlled by the media in the month led a massive campaign against Ankara.
It just seemed like the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the charge of senior state representatives that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal trade in oil in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
This guy's got a good shot.
But the official message came in Petrohrad that it's time to move on.
At the end of the meeting, only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared such a victory.
For Ankara the benefits of the statement are clearly clear.
In the first row, Erdogan was almost free of power during the last month of the uncomplicated strike, and therefore he needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have probably also been reported.
There is also economic motive.
The Russian sanctions had a serious impact - particularly the destruction of charter flights, which annually transports several million Russian tourists to the Turkish border.
This figure has been reduced by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour of operators and charter companies here will breathe when it comes to the restoration of the flights.
They're working on the Mediterranean road movement at the end of the season.
Even this week's state television promised more cheap fruit and vegetables when the agricultural comedians were allowed to import them from Turkey again.
"Tourist there, it's coming back here," as the news reported in the news of Vedemosti.
But the visitor had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara's in the West is bad for what she thinks about having a coffee reaction to trying to convert.
In addition, long-term non-lethality talks on EU entry and Putin's entry - which breathes after the possibility of using and reviewing Turkey's route to the West.
The Russian leader certainly received bonus points when Ankara asked for help from the elected authorities after the shooting.
You need to understand that for Moscow, which has deep rooted fear of changes in the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this southern, southern European Parliament allowed Russia and Turkey to predict what one of the analysts described to me as a "unsanitary link": how the two countries that feel are being rejected and used in the West.
Despite publicly showing mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It would be said that, after almost three-year initial talks, both presidents at the press conference indicated that they had not mentioned this issue.
The Turkish President intended to give an answer to the question of differences between them, while Putin decided to resolve these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common word on the question of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a simple disaster, when a NATO member shot a Russian warplane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside of Scotland
According to the Executive Director, a sign of RBS should be attached to the role of the office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will lose for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS signal was connected to the global banking ambitions.
She took them when she was about eight years old and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, RBS was used to protect other consumer finance brands.
Millions of people left behind on the sponsoring of international sports, from the six-nation football champion after the Winbled Andy Marraye champion.
Now, however, it was decided that it would be better to make more out of more national symbols.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used in Scottish customers, but will not allow new businesses.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except for the centre and coded stock on the bridge, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank mark is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the journey to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered us questions about Ross McEwan.
The BBC Scotland station said: "The RBS will cease to be our investor mark and the sign for which our employees are working because we are now becoming more and more a bank sign."
Because the bank itself became a global sign, it became a global sign and RBS.
Now I'm saying we don't have a global ambition anymore, we've got the power of the home scene.
Each of these signs will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these signs.
RBS has already indicated that it will not continue in its sponsorship of Six Nations, has prepared a profile of individual characters of sport sponsoring.
"It has been a good time for us to move to the bank because the basic question (which we are dealing with) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" the Executive Director said.
Three years ago, it would be very interesting if we said we'd become a great bank for customers and they'd show up.
But together with the way we focused on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think there's a lot of change.
We can recall these signs again, I think that the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horses Predlection led to the target 3000. victory
The Dettor violates the Champagne Post, which the second victory in New Market brought to him 3,000 victories
Uncle Frankie Dettori won 3,000 won in Britain on Friday in New Market.
This lover won his second victory at night on his local route - on the Predlection horse that John Gosden is training.
Five-hundred-year-old Italy is a sixth-year-old jockey that has achieved such a result in the equivalents.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
A three-year-old champion named Dettori, who first won the Ghyyar horse, said: “It’s unique. ”
I'm very talented because my family is here too
I'm very glad it came to Newmarket because I was here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge action, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm tired, and I'm very grateful.
Detor collects freelance when he comes after victory Predlection
Two jockeys of this quirk got in cross-sections - a champion of Richard Johnson and a 20-year-old champion of Sir Anthony McCoy, who led to more than 4,300 winners during his careers.
Lester Piggott, nineth winning Derby, 4 493 winnings in career
Frankie is one of the best joggs of modern times, and it's not surprising that he got a knife that only a few runners got before him.
It's strong and strong, but it's just his tactical fissure, which separates him from the other runners in the station.
He's a fantastic delivery ambassador, his promotion, and his charisma have been attracted to this sport for a long time.
A few weeks ago, I told Frank in Epismus that if he didn't just walk around the weekend and get big enough, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
The truth is, Frankie took the winner to Great Britain for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a healthy attitude, which is good for British sports, but most importantly, he's an incredible jock.
Frankie Dettor praised his success with his summer jacket
From the summer’s finals after the summer season - Frankie Dettori was one of two decades of British equinoxes.
It was like a ride on the mountain floor.
The inevitable number of winners of large competitions, including his known "great seven" in Ascot. He survived but also the plane's planes and had a ban on the launch of drugs.
Three years ago, he first stood up when he returned after six months of command, but showed an incredible inner strength, and in spite of all the suspects he returned in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettor has already declared that he'd like to continue in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin missed the head of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday unexpectedly abandoned Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest colleagues after many years.
Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "blessed Ivanov from his service to the head of the Russian presidential office," but there was no reason.
We'll take his place with Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vaino was a diplomat before.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked on a mission in Tokyo.
On the websites (in Russian) it is stated that he later made the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
He said, “Thank you for your faith.”
I believe that the most important administrative role is to support your activities in the interests of the state's head in the meaning of the proposal for laws and control of the extent to which your instructions are complied with.
Putin at the Russian television station on Friday announced that Ivanov asked her to be released from office and recommended that she be rewarded directly by Wajno.
A witness to smiles?
This step completely mysteryed Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest partners to Vladimir Putin and worked as Putin for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who broadcast state television, both men announced that the head of the presidential office would proceed to its own request.
But the smiles in the camera convinced a few people - especially now, in front of parliamentary elections.
So it's about the consequences of some war on power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once considered to be a potential president also engaged in the pursuit of Russia's environmental policy was very distrustful.
The comments made by Putin on the Kremulu pages are quoted: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in the discussion to give me this very special post, even if you could say a problem post, for four years.
It seems I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov's position was entered in December 2011.
Previously, the position of the President of the Government and the Minister of Defence had been suspended.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the National Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 90th year, when Putin was a member of the Russian Federation's Federal Security Service (FSB), which was reimbursed by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanova one of his five closest coworkers.
In fact, Ivan's time was even reflected that he could become the successor of Putin in the head of the state after his second voluntary period, because the third period would be counterproductive for Putin.
This post, however, was taken by another colleague of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin had just returned to the presidential office three and a half years later, becoming a prime minister.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the series of minds of the crime, was released after what the director agreed to.
Gibson was involved in physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The TV stations ABC and CBS produced by the series were notified in a joint announcement of its release.
Gibson, who was playing Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his announcement.
There's been creative differences in the scene and I can't find it.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to the ABC and CBS television stations, details are available on how Gibson's position disappears from the series that follows the stories of the FBI team, something later.
Four-and-a-half-year-old heretic, who celebrated the main role in the Dharma and Greg's meeting, has been in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the minds of criminals, and during the last twelve years I gave them heart and soul," Gibson introduced in his statement, which he published in Friday.
I was hoping I'd be there by the end, but it won't be possible now.
I would still like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, leaders, our wonderful team and especially the great fans in which this show could be trusted.
The return of the series to the 12th series is expected on 28 September.
In Banff, they arrived in a fishing garden.
The man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain is thought to be the 75 custodial fish can be the sandy peaks left there by the water freeze.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, on the Periscope channel, confirmed a short film of his discovery in the belief that someone could help him explain how about five centimetre fish got on his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Currently connected to Fife
The project for 1.35 billion free must be completed by May 2017
Engineers have offered the north floor and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So it's the first of the four conclusions between the “silver plates” that are now almost completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 lines of iron.
The project for 1.35 billion free must be completed by May 2017.
Economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnesses of how construction engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and volume of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the space of the delicate bridge, which required extraordinary accuracy.
At its place, there are now more than 79 % of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the area is now moving to Rosyth, so the whole area is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first conclusion of each bridge is always an important mill.
On this wonderful project, this conclusion is a glimpse of the earthly establishment.
After installing the last part of the road plane and its connection to the expanding North Tower, we then had to close the last line on the north side - towards the concrete.
We did this by crossing the north approach 700 millimetres south of the road.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate surgery.
Massive because the tradukt is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tonnes and it was necessary to extract it by weight about 3 %.
Delicate because the tolerance with which the team worked was very small - only a few millimetres per direction.
Everything went very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are "happy to be alive" after the flood of water from their fishing boats in England.
Moelfre RNLI rescue members' station announced an outbreak on Friday at 13:20 a.m. of the British summer post of the Moelfre incident.
All three men tried to swim safely, while their crew continued unevenly.
"We have seen their members circle around them, and thought it was the worst," said Cormiologist of the surviving member Moelfre Vince Jones.
"A strong wind struck her and left them until we were gone," he added.
Two men saved the local fishing boat, a third man in 60 years of age was found without a saved belt, worn out as a suit.
All were transferred to the flag of the coastal rescue member and transported back to the rescue member station
Jones said: “Three men are happy that they are alive and without harm.
The ship's engine had a lan for emergency exit, but somehow it came to his connection from the person who led when it came to the conversion.
Someone screamed at those tops holding a protective hand.
The court refuses to resolve the case because of Tluchoro's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the complaint, had received from Prime Minister Nequé and his former chief of the Cabinet of Jany Nagy's political traffic, thus a lucrative post for political engagement.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schnajdr, Fukas and Tluchor made it possible by their resignations.
Then they appeared at influential posts in state companies.
And that's why they also raised suspicions of payment and ended up in jail for a month.
According to the court, however, it was wrong to expect such compensation of almost 2 million kroner.
The fraud now appears in the case as a witness, according to the case of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Ouija board and solves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena King wants to be careful (resolvent criminal affairs - see Red.) and to be given the possibility of taking action.
The case will likely be brought to the attention of another Prague court.
The King has already released the fault of Jan Necessus, before Nagay.
It was about the alleged abuse of military intelligence to follow Prime Minister Nequés Radky's first wife.
In this case, Tluchor did not.
According to Dr. Jaroslav Ortman, it's about the most extreme reaction.
I believe that impartiality cannot be expressed in such a way that the court is excluded if the witnesses have a wife or a relative in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to be judged at all, to be known for the crime.
"I think it's sweet," he added.
In the case of political traffic, he was also accused of Roman Boček, former officer.
According to his lawyer Petra Toman, however, the random object would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the Court of First Instance heard a complaint by a former chief of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Petra Necése Jany Nagyov (Today’s Innocent) and other accused of misuse of the Military Report.
There's no time with your husband to the court.
The abuser was supposed to solve the issues about Perutk.
For example, the wife of the emissary had to judge President Miloša Landa's case on the democratic pre-trial journalist Ferdinand Peroutkov.
The Earth said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schools is already dead!
The girl must have disappeared during the plane crash of the forces.
In Syria, along with his two old friends, she flew to the airport from the London Gatwick airport.
The British Ministry did not comment on her death report.
The young Londoners who fled the house were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border by police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abasse and Kadiza Sultana were appointed by the media for their next former associate from the London school of Bethnal Green Academy.
The event called for a wide range of attention, as well as a spirit in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security reports suggest that about 600 British Muslims have recently traveled to Syria, from about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined the IS radicals and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dreams for hundreds of dollars.
Great pay job you don't even need a high school.
That's what it looks like to be the first look at the work of a witch.
And often on the other side.
The output is not only an extremely high price for Czechs (in Prague you work in IT up to 180 000 Kč), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the vast lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, about 20,000 IT specialists are missing in Czech.
The most visible is based on the statistics of the staff agency Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
The candidates can choose between several job offers.
So they do not support candidates for job positions, but the job position for candidates, comments by Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't necessary.
Higher education is not necessary for the victims.
Higher education is a good foundation and is a comprehensive indicator of the intelligence and educational skills of the candidate, but there is often little common knowledge of development.
Experts have to keep learning new things, which once studied high school doesn't work, says Petr Kubačka, Director Monster Career CZ.
It's going to be at Prague.
The dogs are moving too high over the republican average.
The most money will come to Prague and Brno, the region is no longer such an emergency.
"The weather conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
At the highest level, they will reach the Technical Director.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 Kč.
In other regions, the payment is lower, but not less than 80,000 Kč.
The requests are also the IT project managers.
At the entrance, you can make 60,000 - 100,000 Kč.
The color is about absolutes.
While in some professions it is often required to appear equally at the office of employment, it is not paid in the courts.
If the company is to take over and reimburse a professional from another company, they are pleased to be able to adapt.
They can still hide it from themselves.
They won't give up without a language.
The skills of a foreign language are common in every profession, but there is a need for minimally sound English.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is in some IT positions of necessity.
On the other hand, we meet with many cases when companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, the employer is in charge of more foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he will provide Director Kubačka.
Good in Googlu, there's paradise.
Only quiet can often work for employees in Googlu.
Of course, for them, it is a time of work, a possibility of work from home or various cuts, not just for mothers.
"Innovated fathers, society provides four weeks after the birth of the child," says Martina Jonek, Google’s spokesman.
Waiting also provides health care for employees and families, care, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at work.
Whoever wants to learn, he has green and doesn't care what he wants to learn.
But the benefits will not end.
Such a full refrigerator free of charge is certainly not to be taken for granted.
Healthy meals (in some places and breakfast and dinner) are available on the site every day.
Moreover, in all the offices of the so-called microchip, where people always find a healthy ovaries, they express themselves.
And if nothing comes out, as far as it's concerned, it's going to be in a box that employees can take home tonight.
And what about the reasons for these inconsistencies in Czech terms of incredible benefits?
Create creative and motivating environments!
"It is not important for Google to sit in an office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, promotion or development, ideas and innovative solutions," he adds.
The UN has severely criticized Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday that it systematically violates human rights of criminalizing offenders.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "calls for serious concern about Bulgaria's lack of international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He warned that "it is particularly disturbing to be a witness to how important and attractive public personalities express public support for criminal armed wars, which, by the way, regulate the waves at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most important problems is that almost all people who pass through the Bulgarian territory in an irregular way are automatically affected," Zeid emphasized.
And what is worse - they are often punished and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
The Bulgarian year held 14,000 migrants, the same period as 21,000.
Pokémon Go - health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.
A number of people during the last decade complain that teenagers and children no longer play outside and give priority to spending free time in front of images.
The Pokémon lifts people out of the trap and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screen was originally spent on television, later on video games and the latest on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about the fashion that Pokémon Go is, the applications are based on sets that first appeared in the video games at the end of the 90s (later a series was created, playing cards and more).
As in many cultural phenomena, this new game was introduced at the beginning of June in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to a low interest rate.
The introduction in other countries was then delayed due to the possible interest that led to overload of servers.
Pokémon got more users over a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on the smart phone are going out looking for Pokémons who are following GPS help, and if they find it, they can "fuck it" (through screenshot on the phone) or "read".
Mani has captured the generation that played the game at the younger age, from the sedentary and the woman outside looking for Pokémon.
In the United States this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that a "meaning" person will do every day.
The Cardiogram app for smart hours from Applu, which is followed by 35,000 users, recently for Washington Post, reported that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people who have been watching each day for 30 minutes has increased from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who plays Pokémon Go - see only gross data on level exercises.
Many public campaigns aimed at people "find 30", "get out of the hole" and "have been active every day" fell on an unprecedented basis, because most public health-oriented messages are boring and certain to people who don't look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in the control of weight, high blood pressure, sugar and a long list of benefits that we cannot complete here.
But the beauty of the Pokémon game makes him happy that people go out and do something that's fun.
You cover three healthy pills - movement, fresh air and sunscreens. And fun.
Some people even get new friends at the funeral party.
As it is, they will find themselves, of course, the noble patrons who are looking for any clues to make themselves difficult.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What, like?
He's getting drunk.
In their time applications for smart phones, such as Fitbit should have been able to monitor our activity, but they didn't give us reason to do something like that in this game.
The news is coming up and it's not going to be interesting at some point.
All thanks to the success of Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in the struggle for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biless got gold in more women's gymnasiums
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the surprise.
Simone Billes is immune to all this.
Dynamic overstep.
No snitch on the piano.
They're all on the plain.
It's amazing in everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
Ninety-five American gymnasiums went on Thursday directly after the title in the majority and the other on the full screen under the Olympic reflectors.
The overall outcome of 62,198 clearly confirmed her defeat before the throttle medalist and member of the "final five" team of Aliy Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliyo Mustafin.
Simone Biless (USA) on Thursday, during the graduation at the final match of individuals in the sports gym at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biless became a fourth American in a series that won more, and five entirely when she confirmed her story of the best of its generation and perhaps the best of it.
When her total final score was on the table and her long way to the end of this moment, she appeared on her face.
This success leads to the same league of individual athletes in their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to his sport:
Biles's sport has dominated her last three years, won 15 medals on world champions - including 10 gold. Her outstanding compositions are the blends of ambition and precision and the Olympic champion of 1984 marked Mary Lou Retton as "the best prize she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not even between Billes and the rest of the train, but between herself and her too much expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals, would be considered a failure.
Simone Billes (USA), left, and Aly Raismans are involved in the victory of the gold and silver medals in the finals of the women's majority at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biless received the afternoon when she was a runner in the famed national team coordinator of Marthy Karoli.
Biless insists that during his long journey to the top, he never looked at the copper, which is not so completely true.
Part of its composition in simple - the one that contains typical three salads with a double round - is based on the Latin song that would just walk home, outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not an accident.
The girl was adopted by her ancestors as a gun and her talent revealed the mother of coach Aimee Boorman's journey to the gymnasium, where Boorman's train was trained and where he gained strength.
The competition has not won since 2013 - this is the result of the victory that can continue as long as Billes wants.
Even though Mustafin's taking over for a short walk thanks to the two rounds, it was just an illusion.
Claden and simple - where Billes defends the world champion - wait.
She got back to her head with 15,433 points for the piano - and finished with 15,933 points in plain.
The Raismans gave her a nice hug when they were waiting for the final score - only formality - and around three-thirds of the red, white and blue walls, Billes' ears appeared when the request, which she once wrote, was fulfilled.
Raisman's execution was so little paid for the Olympics four years ago when it was the third time with Mustafin, but it was a bronze due to the count of three best sets.
This time, a twelve-year-old captain of a team that the Americans call "babe", was quite ahead.
After their simples, they sent a gift to the air bubbles, received back, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biless, a contribution that this nine-year-old athlete placed this week on Twitter, where it became a simple hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot in the hearing of music in the car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl died at the age of 12 during the most important ten-year-old attack, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot when they sat in the car, told and listened to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellisov and daughter Ellis Mallis Maleh were shot in a car parked on the road to the entrance.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the companion and fired eight wounds from the handgun.
According to the police, there are no three-fold killings because the attacker didn't take the money, nor the amount of $2,900, which he had in his possession, one of the adult victims.
Speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators found out if the shooting had no connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two major Spanish fourths, a total of nine attacks took place in four months, where seven people were killed and two others were injured.
"It happens in the villa's fourth front of the house," Howard pointed out this month for the KKHO station CBS.
The police are thought to have used several cars, including the Nissanu, the Black BMW at the end of the 1990s and the White Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal what evidence led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same murder.
Ellisova (33) was transferred to a hospital where she later suffered from her injuries.
Liner's (31) and daughter Ellis's Maleah died on the spot.
A witness from the police reported that it was not unusual for women to sit in the parking lot and listen to music.
The authorities have also published a report on the shooting, with an empty delivery only half an hour before the three-day murder. The police believe that this serial killer was the source of the shooting.
The inspectors found the boots and the rest of the ball in the seat and made the ball under the engine cap.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalus: "His attitude improves"
Edmund Piccito, like most children of his age, loves music, toys, and of course, his mother.
But unlike their breeders, they suffer from microcephalitis, which is the result of genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciutova, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, like the first time I thought I wouldn't manage this.
I can't handle this.
I'm not ready for this.
What is not true is clearly that you're prepared for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know and that he may not even pass.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the facility.
"My first reaction was that I thought people wouldn't do this today," Picciut explains.
Edmund's on his way with a walker.
He couldn't sit down or sit down for three years and still doesn't talk.
Some of them are already filling up a little bit.
He's coming with help and rides.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves music.
Elizabeth introduces a sign word that Edmund says "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him a sign language," said Picciutova for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign word - it says that Edmund has invented some signs himself.
Microcephalie may arise from a number of different strains: genetics, as in the case of Edmunda, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as hospitals or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can be eliminated in an essential way.
It's too early for us to say what will happen to Zika virus in the lives of taught people.
Piccito reminds us of the citadel tax that will choose the uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's going on?"
What's next?
And it's still not certain.
In fact, I never asked myself what the whole prophecy is, because I don't expect anyone to ever tell me.
But Piccito has an encouraging message for the mother of all the children who suffer from the convulsions caused by Zika.
Things are getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Strong rain and massive floods in Louisiana enabled the government to announce the emergency situation on Friday. In the state, another amount is expected in Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that, after extreme leaks, the river flows to the south of Louisiana and in the south Mississippi flows out of its shores and threatens the vast waters.
Governor Louisian John Bel Edwards said state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the reached areas.
Mike Steele, the government's national security and preparedness office, said they're getting requests for vehicles to drive in water, crews and peaches.
Steele said that only the Tangapaho's circle asked for tens of thousands of pieces of sand.
In most of southern Louisiana, they will continue to work on Saturdays.
The meteorological service in the declaration indicated that the sea could extend more than 8 to 13 centimetres above sea level.
In southern Alabama, there was a leading guard in preparation on Friday when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Comite Rivers in Baton Rouge and Amite in Denham Springs have to grow on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both can swim a series of houses in the local areas of Baton Rouge.
He further noted that the danger is that the floods after crossing the Ascension area, when these torrential rivers are only to land on the island of Maurepas.
Tickfaw, from the southern border of Mississippi, in Liverpool, Louisiana, has already reached the highest level of local time by Friday at 9 a.m. on the highest level.
The rescuers are still drawing people out of the water supply in Amit and Wilkinson's grave in the southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his own son were already in the middle of five of Gloster's survivors.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his home, fell fast by night.
He said he warned him of his next innocent son, who lives far away.
"We woke up and the water came close," said Hansford.
We had her to the trap.
According to his wife, it's the tallest cold she's ever lived on in her last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family are reached and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford pointed out that the crisis workers had saved all three large military-cost vehicles and transferred them to the bus station in Gloster, where they stayed on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continued flow of waste, the flow of "fast spreads" and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautman, a observer recently reported that between midnight and Friday morning, 35 centimetres of rainfall fell.
Krautmann said the ground is very strong from the middle.
The authorities indicated that the costly rain and the paid roads required the rescue of the inhabitants of their homes during the Tangapaho era and the cancellation of the education in the five school courses.
The WWL station area of the CBS reported that 200 houses were flooded according to the size of Tangapaho.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches that are both now flooded.
The old town of Robby Miller reported that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by high water.
In the city of Amite and in Hammond there were arrangements for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to look," he said.
In Tangapaho district in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and local residents were able to ask for the sand that they could lift and try to protect their homes and businesses in front of the water.
"The last major floods we had here in March," said City Manager Lacy Landrum.
It looks like these floods are going to be the same.
Rupert Lacy, director of the crisis situation in Harrison County, Mississippi, pointed out that there is still a persistent rain on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said a few houses were announced on Thursday, but on Friday none of them appeared in the report.
Keith Townson, the leading Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I saw water in a few places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot like a solution", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, there was a six-year-old high in Philadelphia, which is already a second child shooting in town at the age of 6 this week.
Her ancestors identified her as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
They say that the boy suffered a number of shots, including weakness, legs, liver, and stomach, but he was aware of the hospital’s transformation.
"He thought it was too much, his little body was shot like a solution," said his grandmother, Delores Mendez's station.
I can't believe that.
The boy was in a critical condition in the hospital and performed several operations.
The family at the station said the boy should get well.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of basic school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown section.
Three other men were shot: two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One of the men 29 years of age is in a critical state, according to CBS Philadelphia, two other victims are in a stabilized state.
According to the report of the station, the child was shot at the previous vehicle seat with a nine-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and the police were wondering if any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
CBS Philadelphia's investigators indicated that it was likely that there was an attacker between several armed men.
A weapon of the attack type, belonging to a different weapon, was found on the site.
According to everything, it's definitely about the ongoing battle.
On the street, the guards were on both sides of the hall.
It seems, therefore, that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved here," said Captain Filadelfs police officer Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.
No one's been arrested and the police are investigating video games from the camera.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in a firefight in front of the house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl's getting drunk and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's exactly what I'm thinking of the female team for the annual Olympic Games, and that's for some reason right now.
First of all, I've been on every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, in this team there are three gymnasiums, Simone Biless, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandes, who inspired so many young girls.
Each is proud of the composition of this team that complements Aly Raisman, who is the Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kociano.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of a black and Latin American in the mirror of this sport.
The number one in the last four years was an African.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second floor.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals became an amazing champion of Olympic heroes and the Americas.
Now the world could be a witness to the incredible performance of the three-dimensional world winners of Simone Biless, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who presented unexpected but mysterious Gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became a fourth American, who gained gold in the women's majority of individuals.
And a member of Aly Raisman's team got a strike.
We're witnesses at the top of the sport, but it doesn't look like it in the gym hours in the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie have completed the Olympic team on the same route as Aly and Madison.
They are “the final fifth” because the gymnasium on the next Olympic Games will be composed only for four years, and this is the last year when Marta Karoli is training.
The reality is, however, that Gymnastics are financially profitable sports and gymnasiums are mainly practiced in private gym clubs that hold parents who pay the costs for training, training, travel, clothing, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their believers and families). And this is not all there is far away.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas on the subject that can support activities.
In these clubs, they have a huge amount of training, and for the family, the gymnasiums and gymnasiums are a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Billes, and Maggie Haneyo, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained at the time they started at the gym.
It is our duty to bring the gymnasiums that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of young girls who were inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded a gymnasium 20 years ago.
In my organisations, where we offer free gyms or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people in the city (mainly the Black and Spanish origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnasium for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and enjoy this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop the strength, generosity and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and decision-making of the mind.
This combination refers to lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gym.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
I thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the "Water Power" and for winning the Olympic team's gold. And I thank you for encouraging so many young girls for all the reasons to be on the road to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next stage
The ministers hoped that following the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would come to the conclusion of an amendment, but 58 per cent of the 37 000 young doctors who participated in the treaty refused.
In June, Hunt left plans for the conclusion of a contract with NHS being in the "land of nobody" and another delay would have a harmful effect on employees and patients.
The first doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Commission for Young Doctors in a statement last night, stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular in the sense that there will be an increase in the current crisis of labour force and therefore the fair treatment of all doctors."
Eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters into the new contract, progress is needed and time is coming.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through reconciliation met with a lack of access to Dr. and often with a listening silence from the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise of last month, this opportunity is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to go, press on the release and resolve the concerns of young doctors."
If that doesn't happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the final stage, about 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were made during the final stage of the depth, as sisters and specialists were allowed to represent doctors who were among the protestors.
The Ministers hoped that following the conclusion of the treaty, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would come to the conclusion of the amendments.
BMA wants to pay more for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, president of NHS, called on young doctors not to enter any stage.
Mortimer said: “The campaign will be carried out only a little or nothing, but it will cause the pressure on the already overloaded teams and services and the increase of anxiety, harassment and abuse for patients, healing personnel and their families."
In the past two months, we have met with the advice of young doctors and with the Ministry of Health and others who have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the informant.
Employees hoped that the continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as education, flexibility in schools, further training for those who return after retirement, cost of training, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and differences in wages between subjects - was evidence of the fact that employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health have reached agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
The treatment in the 60th root of the day can reduce the risk of infection
Thousands of patients at risk of infection will be able to take medicines that are estimated at around 80 kroner (two libres). The authorities recommend that more patients be given for a longer period of time.
The antihypertensive treatment of Ticagrel reduces the risk of relapse in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered for 12 months after administration of the infarction to reduce the risk of death or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that human treatment be given over four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that people be given over four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, heart disease afflicts about 140,000 people each year, and a quarter of them still survive or die from heart disease.
Infarction and death are caused by a collection of tissue that creates a relevant species on the walls of the arterial walls.
If it comes to dehydration of this species, it may result in bleeding, blood clotting, and cardiac infarction.
If a wound is released, it may continue with a blood clot, block the blood supply into the brain and cause brain death.
People who have already been infected are exposed to a higher risk of another infection.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the commercial name Brilice, reduces the risk of becoming less likely to the injury suffered.
The NICE Directive, which was adopted today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of tagagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg in combination with aspirin twice daily over the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had infections and who will be able to maintain further heart disease or death - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of packaging may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
Ticagrel has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and death in people already infected with aspirin.
It is our pleasure to be able to expand the possibilities of treatment available to thousands of people who will be able to enjoy it in advance.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - over three years are limited, it is not recommended to treat this time.
A digital culture has begun to form a cascade in Muslim areas
The old town of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year because of corruption, which was linked to government news
The culture of political accuracy led to a review of widespread doubts in the Muslim communities, which is now part of the government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes the police, volunteer inspectors and councils for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former secretist of the community, now the leader of anti-corruption policies, said that the threat of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police would have to make the coordinated and targeted voters safe in front of the polls.
He recommended that lovers take evidence of identity with themselves and be able to prove who they are when they are.
At the same time, the volunteers will be able to enter their name and address.
The report further suggests that in the case of a vote, the right person should be given an inconsistencies in order to prevent someone from wanting to vote twice.
Whistlers should have more protection, says Pickles.
He requests that the press be given greater access to the documents from the meeting and to decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
"Not only is it about protecting against voluntary obstacles, but also about protecting local governments against the wider corrupt environment and financial obstacles that are at hand," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of a volunteer scandal in Tower Hamlets in western London.
In the last year, the special election court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his position after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman 's religious sense of his Muslim community has been "skinic" and has concealed his criticisms of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his own words, “made his campaign so that it would be the religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been lost or as a result of theft of identity when a person votes and speaks out against someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of evidence on the whole country.
He expressed particular concern over the arguments in the corresponding vote, which claimed that the elderly members of the Muslim community had developed a pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the voluntary system, including the submission of evidence of authenticity
His report states: “There has been evidence that harmful members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been forced to vote in accordance with the wishes of the elders, and above all in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There has been concern that... the state institutions have engaged in such conduct because of "politically correct" sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including that political activists are prohibited from manipulating with corresponding votes and thus prevent "voting."
A report now valued by Theresa Mayova also requires more thorough control in registrations to prevent the use of voluntary lists for immigration and dose-related routes.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to submit evidence of authenticity before voting.
Use an insulating ink on the fingers during the vote to prevent someone from singing twice.
The implementation of systematic control of the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
The requests for automatic correspondence vote shall be limited to three years.
To order political activists and activists to manipulate with their voiced correspondence and free speech.
Give the police the right to create around the volunteer halls of the corridor.
Change the laws to make it easier for developing persons to become illegal under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prescribe photos in free places.
Require that only English (with the exception of Wales) be employed in volunteer places.
Strengthen the training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that volunteers go to the volunteer cabins individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it's "excessing" that, in the case of Tower Hamlets, there was no charge of criminal acts.
"The Court of Appeal dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his agents for corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was followed by a criminal investigation on the basis of the underlying suspicions - in the strength of evidence of the criminal act.
It also criticises the endless "control of the screws" in volunteer registration departments at the workshop.
Sir Eric said: “The London Court's decision in the case of the Tower Hamlets bombing.
Our people have a hard reference to the obstacles of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of voluntary obstacles and the attitude of some authorities jeopardise this reputation.
Explosion of the cyclical double leading Kate and other two known properties of the Olympics in Rio
This week, the fans of the Olympics in Rio 2016 broke into the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Provot, who is even a relatively similar leader from Cambridge.
But the four-year-old Olympics are not far from the only athlete moving year on gold, which can be bought by his own double from a number of known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the column for women, F.C., has compiled a list of Olympics that are more than far away than the Hollywood Celebrates.
As a hunter: A member of the American team of firefighters, Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCapriov
According to a double Kate on a cycling drive of a number of people online quickly showed that a certain lucre could be a couple of stars by Leonard DiCapria.
The U.S. bomber Brady Ellison conducted on Twitter after the shootings of his pictures, on which he thought was like a train from Wall Street.
Brady himself saw the media madness and admitted that he had heard about his appearance to Lee from a little girl.
"I don't see any great similarity, even in addition to the ears," Brady said for Huffington Post.
"It's a guy and it looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be further highlighted this year: an idea of a match between the British leap to the far-reaching Greg Rutherford and the beloved priest Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian composer Aliye Mustafin, with her big, clear eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the blue pool, South Africa's Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell Matthew Morrison's series star a few years ago.
And for the change: The user thinks Nathan is "a athletic version" of the film Home (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis stars of Rafael Nadala and priest Josh Hartnett, who have similar sharp faces and cuts.
The Russian silver-striking flyman Yulia Efimov is not the only snowflake and blonde hair like Annalyn McCord's. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say it looks like "a battalion version of Joseph Gordon Levitta."
Published Women: White Photoball Hope Solová (left) and Hercules Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very happy that the similarities appeared and others
The theory of theology: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed his satisfaction over the fact that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solov and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
Photo star Hope Solova and Hercules Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a truly incredible face and face form.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jenny's smile, which is almost identical to the smile of the hero Laura Linney's smile, or the golden medal holder of Gabby Douglas' gym, who dances with his beautiful wide smile that would copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, stars of the film Bravo, girls!
The comment of the Olympics CBC Station is sorry that he said about the Chinese Navy that it was "suppressed"
The middle-lived truck from the Olympics at the CBC station ran out of four-year-old Ai Yanhan commenter Byron MacDonald. The plane ended in the fourth place of the race of women on 4x200 m free-style stamps.
The Canadian CBC was forced to apologize for what one of its commentators said that the four-twentieth Chinese fleet was "sustained as a smurf" and "swirl".
Commenter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the final female stamps, 4x200 m free-style began to hide his own ideas.
MacDonald, who had to bring "life" to the CBC team, declared, among other things, "This little quadrilateral from China gave it up, you crazy."
A sudden explosion, it looked like a smell, it blew up.
Thank you.
China's Ai Yanhan's (14) sailed the second train ticket at 1:57.79 - then by 1,61 Tuesday less than Canadian Taylor Ruck and enabled Canadians to reach China.
The fans in Canada began to call online quickly and were frightened by the tone and language that the commenter used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "The voter on the CBC announced that the four-year-old bird from China "birth" ??"
This idiot didn't realize he's still sending it."
Ai Yanhan from China at the end of the women's steffet race at 4x200 m free-style was described as: “The 14-year-old from China gave it up, you crazy."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his call
When Twitter users found out how uncomfortable Byron MacDonald is, they didn't keep back.
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a band of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was hosted by the CBC, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said: "We are talking about a comment on the operation of the ship that escaped the shipment."
It was an unfortunate election of words, we're sorry it happened."
The CBC station finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Spokesman Scott Russell has to apologize to MacDonalda.
CBC then copied and put their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who were interested in the comments of commentator MacDonald
The station also apologized quickly and confirmed the declaration.
She's really sorry that the word was pronounced, she shouldn't have gotten into the ethers.
We quickly apologized to our monsters in sending out and to those who follow us on social networks.
To make it clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the fly, not the fly alone.
In other words, there was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in his live transmission and tried to explain his note by arguing that he did not want to be identified as a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the woman's chair," he said in sending the Olympics to the CBC station.
"I had the idea of performing a fly and not a person flying like that."
"I don't have to say that I didn't mean anything and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark are offended by a woman who has recently tried a lower job in the middle of the trade
When the woman went out to try the boilers in the middle of Primark, they weren't buying a sure way to see.
To make it even worse, she tried how much her size fell, she took her pants off and brought them back to the rule.
In the look she continued and finally went to the shopping center of Bouverie Place in Flocestone, she tried four pairs of pants.
Trade Primark at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkeston, where a woman tried to cook before she returned to the rule
The mother of Jenny Davidson’s two children, who were in the store at the time, pointed out that a wealthy woman, after testing the underpants, “redressed and came out of the store without buying anything. ”
She said: "The people have not been able to believe with their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took out the rules of the boilers, pulled off her own wallet and the boilers, and set them up.
"She didn't even try to find a discrepancy place - she just stood there, held like an opium."
"Each one just walked away as he pulled his pants again, and obviously didn't like her, because she came back to the rule."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, dressed again and left.
"It seemed to her that she doesn't even care who looks at herself - nor would she think of the person who should buy the pants that she has tried."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “This idea is that we take someone's pets who had someone else and didn't clean them up.
It happened in the afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up the things that she obviously tried to get me out of selling - which is also the only right thing. ”
"It would seem to me that I would bring home new pants and find out that she had another woman, took them off, and that they were not chosen."
A spokesman for Primark's trade said: "Primark knows about the incident that occurred in our trade in Volkestone on 9 August."
All the products concerned were derived from the sale.
How to protect against the attack of weapons by Krav Maga
The outside world is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrach, the great federation of Krav Magy sitting in New York to find out how to deal with armed wolves on a close-up.
This video will show you how to get over violent traffic, whether it's getting close to you in front of or behind.
If he approaches you behind, he says, "Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn to see your enemy and to "have a free shot".
Then you can get a weapon between your front and your shoulder tight before you put it in the face of a free plate.
Then he follows his knees to the weak, and while the attacker falls into disease, you draw a weapon out of his hand, hit it in the face and start shooting it, and then you will keep it focused on it.
If you are approached by an armed man in front of you, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, get the gun and turn it off so that the gift can't be fired.
At the same time, put the force into the weapon and hit the enemy into the chest, then turn the weapon out of his shell, and start shooting, and then die on it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mirrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get through - if you're not the master of the Maga Krav - is to give out all readiness.
Traveller Ian Wright olives the most impressive places in Europe to travel guide
The British passenger decided to make a difficult test of its immune system and a dose reflex - by eliminating the most difficult and most difficult places in Europe.
The Moderator and author of the Ian Wright (51), based on Suffolk, appeared on evidence of the power of his immune system in his language of the euro bank, played at Piccadily Circus, pressed on the toilet in the train and Russian public telephone.
He used a lamp in front of each object to show himself and all of us what he's going to do.
Experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength has also produced interesting results.
The aim of lysing the pressure in the train that thousands of other people have used can be simply disappointing, but the need in the kitchen shower is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright spoke to doctors and specialists throughout his journey across Europe about the strengthening of the bacteria of the greenhouse and about his own health.
Unfortunately, nothing of what he was wearing left in his mouth left nothing worse than a bird.
Ian Wright commended himself for testing the isolation of his rivers on the roads around the world and eating wonderful and wonderful things.
During this mission, he proved his immune system completely safe - from public arrests at train stations after the strike
In a film that highlighted this, she says: “I have been very sick since I was a child and have given myself everything I can, from the wheat after the wheat and the bananas of the water. ”
In the film, his reputation was confirmed by the dosier.
The only thing he refused was the Spanish public funds in Russia.
After a simple star, the lamp showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, clean-cut hands should have less than 60.
One public contract in Russia but olive oil refused after what its lamp showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly cut hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish producers of milk products Valio surrounded passengers with the name The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film he said: “This is almost the easiest thing I've ever felt at the west. ”
There's nothing more spy than this!
I'm not going to take it out because it's useless here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strongth was set in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
Mr. Wright provided Valio Gefilus, which contains bacterium oxysene and vitamins C and D that help people strengthen bacterium and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio’s company for housing, jewelry and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow up and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probation.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "call Ian."
It is said that the health of the storm is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the producers, we wanted to give them more attention - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of electricity and how it is combined with the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the environment is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hacala, who filmed the film, adds: “Let’s say that Ian would lose my respect if he took away something from what I wanted to do with it - as if the countless Russian sunset that appears in the film. ”
To wear some things was naturally tougher for Iana, and the others were pretty tough again.
I'm glad we fought some of those dirty things."
In 2015, Valio carried out a study whereby 84% of respondents associated milk-based acidic bacteria with the health of cereals and butter, and 58% of respondents indicated that at least the products containing added acid-based bacteria were available.
Family of the social needs before leaving destroyed the current building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left the damage in its present home of more than 50,000 libres after the charges of terroring its neighbors were dropped.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of troubles against him.
After their violent eviction from the house, the officials of the housing community were shocked when they found out that property is located in a state of emergency.
In the walls there were walls, the floor coverings were covered, all on the ground, the fighting of wastes and the walls were broken.
The family has already moved away and it's because they live in private homes.
Donna McEvoy, director of housing issues at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried if she was going to save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will most likely lead to fame as a "not so good" part of Cornwall.
This family is not well known and their names are not known.
A couple have three sons who have been staying at home often, and the police have indicated that the horrors caused by the family included street fights using baseball games, fears of surrounding citizens, drug use, drug distribution and loud screams, hacks and assaults.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the rental contract, was sentenced to antisocial behaviour in June.
In a few places in the house that might be cleared, there were impressive wastes.
In a house where drugs were distributed in the past, a low-frequency crisis was eliminated
The neighbors say they saw her on the street, and they called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing was forced out of the house this week after they had received an additional 11 weeks to volunteer.
The neighbors who took refuge were welcome to the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They never tried anyone.”
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, they can't even count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornwall Housing community, said the family could not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family in the house lived for 20 years, the police were regularly summoned to the house
Wastes and old toys moved into the growing part of the present house
She adds: “It is a shame that the renter could not accept responsibility for his own conduct and for the conduct of his family, and that travel is always the last step taken by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very complex case because their conduct was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to be feared by her neighbors.
I love all the work my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall and the local community, who informed us publicly.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to our neighbors and at the same time convey the message that we will not tolerate non-smoker behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of rent who lived in the house at different times were around 20 years old.

Workers will now have to remove waste collection that remained buried around the house
In 2014, the police carried out a survey at home and found over 70 grams of horsepower, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received a warrant when she was tracked down by a drug dealer of Class B who wanted to sell it.
She claimed that the money was determined on the basis of the house for her son, Leo Skeledon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It's because Tanya and her partner are now living in private apartment in Plymouth.
It seems that graffiti were cut in many places at home.
Police say they're going to force the embezzlement of tenants who violate the rules of their rent contracts
Angela Crow of the Denov and Cornwall police indicated that the expulsion was a clear link to other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message for all those who think they can act innocently and those who want to follow such conduct," she said.
The Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-cooperative behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners in protecting our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are scared after a low flight of military pressure aircraft over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sundials in the Portuguese Aveir were terrified of death
The Portuguese military aircraft P-3C Orion flew to an incredible low
The military aircraft reported that it was a fine flight, and that there was no danger of safety.
At the moment when a low-flight passenger landed over a full beach, the frightened tourists of the panic was caught.
At dramatic events, it is seen how the military aircraft is getting to the farthest point of the sun’s touch on the people on the sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The tourists began to wake up after they had been disturbed by the sound of the engine of the Turkish plane without seeing what happens from the darkness.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several athletes who recorded video games of a dramatic flight on social networks, said: “The plane was twice really low, and at one point it seemed to be going to happen. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing and really thought that the plane would fall on my head."
Travellers on the beach in Aveir were terrified when a plane flying low from darkness appeared.
The Portuguese military aircraft today announced that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a wonderful flight with a view to identifying fishing vessels on the coast and had to be low because it was the only way to control ships.
A plane reportedly flew over something more than usual because of the bad visibility caused by fires from nearby forest fires.
Forest fires destroyed part of Portugal in summer and demanded four lives on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's military aircraft today reported that the pilot had to fly low due to hot milk and smoke from the fires which protected him from the sights
The flight was on a wonderful flight and the pilot was requested to identify fishing vessels within the training framework.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of the food service providers do not comply with the legal provisions.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (CHOI) found this in the second quarter of the checks.
In its opinion, the maritime services do not usually inform the rest of their prices or provide written confirmation of the acquisition of orders.
CHOI put 41 pieces in total of 73,000 kroner.
Today, her speaker, Jiří Fröhlich, informed her.
The inspectors found errors at 47 out of 95.
In the absence of information on prices and missing approvals, certain food services have also sold products or provided services at other prices before the meeting.
In five cases, the products were not sold properly and once the seller used an officially unverified measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 kroner.
This was the case with watches, candles and candles, which were not properly marked by mandatory information.
"In view of the fact that in this specific area of services there is still a violation of the law, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London School, which joined the IS, was murdered in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schools that went from London to join ISIS, died in Syria.
The legal representative Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned about her death in Syria several weeks ago.
The ITV News reported on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian plane attack in Rakze, which is a great group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old, and her family died right away when she was ready to flee the war and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and fear for others that these are real dangers associated with the way to the war zone - is that people are better off from making decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schools from the eastern part of London arrived in February 2015 to the airport in Turkey and then to the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultany family learned that she had been married to an IS soldier in Syria and had been here for several months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he will leave Garland as the candidate of the Supreme Court.
The Senate's leader, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the presidential election candidate for democracy Hillary Clinton appoints Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked the name of Garland, although its President Barack Obama has already named it in March.
The Head of the Senate of Mitch McConnell says that the person who replaces the Supreme Court will choose the future president.
Reid said during the conference on Thursday that it is believed that Clinton's selection of Garland "with certain degree of credibility."
Reid's speech later indicated that he didn't talk directly to Clinton about whether Garland would be named, and that he was just speculating.
He evaluated Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want someone else's call to "whisper the ship."
Garland is the president of the Washington Federal Court of Appeal.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's nomination are "responsive" and "poskos" of the Republican candidate to the Presidential Authority of Donalda Trumpa.
He said Trump wasn't coming to the office.
According to the Treats magazine, there are new calendars for "women and men"
Magazín Treats is working with photographer David Bellememem on the release of the calendar for 2017, inspired by the 70's Pirelli calendar.
But instead of distinguished famous personalities, the NU must try to find another generation top model for its calendar 2017.
President Treats Steve Shaw has already told us this year that his store is full of toys from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, the calendar is thought to be too.
"We must return to the exercise of time and classics when women and men are pleasantly feeling and are not inspired by the photograph of the female body," Shaw announced in a press release to issue a calendar.
Women want to be part of this project, because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where's the vinyl? Who really buys gramphones?
Vinyl loves men's self-esteem at the middle of the age.
Before you decide to add the comment section to your notes under the pseudonyms NoAllAccessionsFor the Middle Ages, we note that this product comes from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much debate on the rise of the gramphones is linked not to the boom of millions who want to love the original possession of the physical object, but to the middle age nostalgia.
Those who recently bought the album on wine are the most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people aged 18-24 are at least likely.
In fact, it is not even about the collection of the above-mentioned phantoms - the whole has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramphones, they probably want to keep their feelings (56% version 53%) and they like themselves (69% version 66%).
But the results of YouG are true?
If this blog had been posted as a television reporter, I would have been watching the camera, as I look into the Russian street in Soho, dressed in the right-hand chair and a broad gesture. Then I would stop, shake my hand and say something authoritative, like, "So let's go look at it."
So let's look at this.
As soon as Soho's heart is slowly exploding his charm and shirt - the buildings, sometimes surrounded by independent sellers, are now filled with hotels, restaurants and food, Confucian and office needs - a number of fantastic specialised shops with gramphones still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop staring at me for a moment, and I'm going to get closer to the different men in these shops and try to figure out what their age is and the emotional situation is.
Stuart (55), a father from Glossow, who follows from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20 has a Sunday meeting in London and is looking for business to spend a few hours.
I wonder if he's a collector.
"I think so," she says.
I've got about 3 or 4 thousand records.
All these recordings remove the walls of his apartment - on the picture above (photo sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him to his house).
This vast quantity of albums and singles is also thanks to the fact that they can afford it: they can now buy gramphones that they could not afford when they came up initially, and they buy what they sold in youth and had no wine.
“Many of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12. I was very small and couldn’t fix them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy them are most likely to invest in their own company, and they add: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray, and he also thinks that a number of customers he meets belong to the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media waves, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old gramphones back.
According to my conversations, the people of their gatherings were most frequently released between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramphones and bought a CD, now sell their CDs to buy their gramphones back," he says.
This could explain the boom of lovers of the gramphones of a certain age.
But what is the emotional importance of the gramphones?
It will not take you more than a few seconds to find out that in business like Phonica, you can find a pleasant community with similar thoughts in music.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly disturbed by the free payment system.
Some graduates of the gramphones can feel confused in the digital world and decide for a known average of the gramphones, things that cause memories of a quiet recovery.
"I think that filling a table or possession of something rich can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector, I have it, and I think it's a lot of people too.
It's a simple way to fill the place in the head.
"We're all like their social workers!" is called a co-workers from a collection of gramphones.
In a survey of ICM companies, almost 50% of the people who bought a wine album a month ago didn’t listen to it.
According to the study, 41 % of the requested gramophones are never used, while 7 % of the gramophone discs are not available.
In this point of report, he must have been seriously worried about the passing of the new compass.
The aspect of "trophys" and life is something that Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy it on the radiohead floor so we can put it on the police," he says.
The percentage of these is not big, but it's going to happen.
It's more about a product page than a song.
There are people who say, "I don't have a phone."
They're younger people, not older, grown-ups who get into it.
Fopp, where at the present time there is almost one suit won by a gramphone screen, has a lot of different visitors on my arrival.
There's a couple of seventy-year-olds, tourists, who're making pictures, pubertys, and women in the middle of the year.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as earlier trades - from the players instead of the balish train calls the latest pop from the Wild Beauts full of synthesisers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly selfish, but the inner trauma is hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various gramphones in the lower.
It's one of those who spend more time looking at the exhibition than she's losing a lot of money.
According to her words, she doesn't do much, so she doesn't seem to think she'd pick up the phonograph records.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on computers or something like that, but grammatical discs have their glasses...," they'll get excited.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the trade that inspired a new generation of lovers of the gramphones: Urban Outfitters.
I guess I'm very busy with girls in the busy jeans and I'm following a group of cute girls who just shut up around the polaroid cameras. Then the father and daughter agree to buy Crossley's gramphone.
The left is the castle whose wall is covered by adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Maca's , a mixture of contemporary and classical music, based on any average collection of the gramphones.
No one looks at them - maybe just because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't reach them.
It's a "wine trick."
But because any appeal to him could mean more money for the sector and send several customers to Soho deeper for another, it's not too much to worry about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where it is likely more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where it is most expensive for the most luxury goods, which it certainly has.
But while I find that the results of YouGov seem accurate - at least in the dealings with the gramphones, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and lovers of viniles who exist in fact, in gramphones and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
It certainly does not take a Thursday morning to travel after trade with the gramphones on Berwick Street, to play a game and avoid looking at a double, thirty-year-old fake television moderator, hiding behind nothing in the middle of the middle age.

The Court of Justice in France refused to cancel the sale in the Jungle Abbey Camp
In France, the court banned orders from the authorities in Calais to demolition ten provisional stores and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial, the authorities in Calais held this week that the state should be able to break up all 72 provisional trades, where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes after energy consumption, offer hair cuts, in provisional restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic food for several euros.
The Calais Prefectal Office argued that it was necessary to close places because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they represent a dangerous source of fire and health risks.
Humanities in the Court indicated that trades and restaurants are vital and that the free food offered by the State-supported associations and other groups does not provide food supplements for growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Sponsored provisional shops and restaurants often provide plants and food free of charge to people in need.
The Court of Justice in Lille decided that there is no legal basis for prohibiting people from carrying out 72 provisional trades, but pointed out that the purposes of Prof. Calais are "intelligible".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that sales of food, coffee and restaurants play a much larger role than simply giving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the rooms provide quiet places to meet the refugees and volunteers.
One of the places where the demolition was threatened was a coffee shop in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which runs the non-profit organization and offers 200 meals a day, hours of English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of people threatened by unexploded people in the camp.
Peticia for the protection of children's coffee has signed more than 170 000 people.
Guardian received a letter that said that the closure of the factory would "be a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old."
The charitable organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday suggested that the number of refugees in the camp increased by the current growth of the coming years to more than 9,000 - which is probably the most over time.
You thought he was dead.
The street crosss itself and the Voyages.
"I could normally train from March," he reported at the start of the summer preparations in full force.
What happened to you?
I had an extraordinary lung embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was at a college in Korea, I didn't know I had some blood problems.
So it's hard to get a long flight to Asia?
I've had two years of hair drying, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me. No one found anything.
Then the wounded came up.
In the summer, the pain will continue, especially when the weather changes or changes.
But nothing that would limit me is more aesthetic.
Did you have concerns about life?
He did.
Last year on the summer tour in the Forests, I didn't know I had embolism, and I couldn't even move there anymore.
I turned my blood off last night.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was still five days completely equipped.
In fact, in the woods, I thought I was dead and my friends and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you compare that?
I guess I had to survive. Now it's just going up there.
I know I have some blood problems that I have to watch more when I fly somewhere.
But it's gonna be all right.
Even if I wanted to get back to Praibram right away, there were problems with my heart.
It's all right now.
From March, I finally prepared my own home to be able to play again.
I promise, I'm physically better at it than I used to.
What do you expect from Usi?
I'm glad the party looks good, most boys I know.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners who come.
Maybe we'll sit down with people so we can get this together.
You'll find out what's going on?
There was a story of the locker, but every season is different.
Two years ago, it was eight, now it's over.
There's a new team in Austria, there's only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extralysis, so there's a big room for improvement.
The way we use it, it's on us.
We'll see for the first rounds who's gonna be fired, we'll probably not.
Is it a lucky shot of Brom's dog?
He's already tried and lived a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last one.
But my future didn't agree with that, I agreed before.
There were other coaches in the game, I was with one big friend, and it was agreed to move here.
I'm not gonna say that.
Finally, Mr. Brom came, and I like it.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been a good player for many decades.
They'll take us upstairs.
What do you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like fighting, I like Hecu and I like to get an opportunity in a non-professional team.
I've been in Pribras for two years, but there's a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team now because it starts from the bottom.
You've mentioned the stranger, he's already training Australian Boeh in Austria.
What does it look like?
I agree with his circumstances. We played against each other at the university.
And once we were there together, we used to sit together at night after parties, so we know each other and we're friends.
We missed 3:1, right at the beginning of the summer preparation in the East I found it.
He's got a Slovenian friend, he's a sympathetic.
There's still American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been writing to the American, looks like a nice boy, Brazil like he's going to be an Englishman.
You've been contacted by the American?
It seemed like a good idea to me.
I'm an actor, so whoever's creating, so I'm supposed to communicate with everyone.
I just found out what it's like for a player, I found a video on the Internet like he's playing, I saw some video.
He's totally fine, he's a rock boy, he's high.
We wrote a couple of messages on Facebook, he looked like a guy who's going to come back to us.
How do you feel about the player unit's position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
But it's only going to be four and I don't have a point of going to shoot.
I'd rather be at the center of the building, I'd rather be with the team than someone else.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be a second player and I'm going to pay for it in full time.
How many times have you been single?
Half a month in Períbra, when Custo was not a captain, he was injured, and there were money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been standing up and I've been playing.
In Brno, where I'm the rescuer, I shot one and two.
The perfect year was in the Old City, after which I had a lot of offer and I just chose Pribram.
Since then, I've been wanted by Buddjovice, and I've stayed, but I haven't finished this season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new start.
Gold number 22.
A short walk will remain in the place of Phelps.
"Being on the stage again and hearing the hymin is as sweet as always," Phelps laughed, and then he had eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and his mother again sat in the shop, the son of Boomer fell asleep quietly on his ears.
I'm living an unrealistic week at the end of the career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming in the morning and in a couple of hours it's gonna be all right, he said.
At the end of Phelps's release, he left a strong Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long career.
Bronz got Čiˈan Wang Šun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the world's low mystery.
After Al Oerterov (disk) and Carl Lewis (far away), Michael Phelps is a third sportsman who has ruled the same discipline in four games for himself.
After most of the race, Philips and the next American Ryan Lochte and the home of Thiago Perreira were held in the head.
While the goldsmiths in the final royal procession sat down to the wooden finish, they disappeared from the medallion position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand its unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremony, he arrived at the end of the race at 100 metres away.
The legend could not have been replaced by Ryan Murphy's country, who won a marked double-dub - a hundred-winning in Rio and a double-crossed track.
At the end of his career, he left for 37 weeks of Australia's sailor Mitchell Larkina, the third of which was completed by Rus Jevgenij Rylov.
While from the world's low mystery, Murphy has only the fifth place from the twentieth century, in Rio, he became a king.
From the mental train, Larkina sat on the same doll just over at a low-world champion.
But he only got medals right now.
Canadian Penny Oleksian and American Simone Manuel were divided into gold.
For the sixteenth anniversary of Olexiac, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second after the stanza.
The blue gold got to OH as the first African in history.
I believe I can be inspiring to others.
These medals are for all those who come after me, sports for them will become love and get to where I am, said Manuel.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the race at 100 metres in the world's record in Rio and still has a strip from the Royal Diaspora.
By the end of the sixth world recordman Australia's Cat Campbell.
The Persian dividend won Japan's Rie Kanet, which was the first Olympic medal in the 1970s.
There is no value in the world's mysteries, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second strike in Rio took Russia, Julia Yefimov, who started games in spite of the touchdown of the past with the non-smokers and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the court, and I don't know why I should always answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, she said Russian.
The right to start in Rio has been enabled until the special sports arbitration panel has been firmly established before the start of the year.
They took my call and I won.
If he likes it or he doesn't, or if he has another opinion to turn to the arbitral tribunal, he'll add it.
Herman: Breaking, we could win.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs lived a special day.
Not until about an hour before the contract, we found out who it was against.
They had to control the tactical preparation.
And then, in a non-traditional time, they started a small box game number 1.
The first set didn't start well, then came up with a leap of opposition, but by condition 19:19 they didn't control the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and comparable, but they did not get the thie-breaking.
In particular, a number of the services shown meant 10:15 missing and locatoring with an Olympic tournament.
"We could beat Russians," Herman said.
How would you evaluate the game?
Hermanov: After an unhappy start before I played, we got to the game.
At the end of the day, he flew me into the last balloon with the reception I had used to get used to.
We lost a set that was key.
In the next set, we got to them with a look at the garden, another defense, and we pressed on the service.
In the thie-break, there were terrible cuts, we picked up on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat Russians.
Case: The damage to the start of the first set, it's gone.
We proved it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great, and thirdly, the service was distributed.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and about the five, we've been busy there a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were jealous.
How did you play number 1 on the little court?
Conclusion: Similar to China at later courts.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
It was one hour in the night, full silence, no music played, nothing.
It was a difference of opinion between the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the event when you discovered the name of the hour before the event?
Herman: It was special.
We started having fun at the game without knowing the players, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like the rest of the team.
But Simon (pain Nausch) got in touch with almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of papers ready with the tactics, so we were pretty well prepared on this page.
Do you remember that you'd ever start a Christmas party?
Herman: Maybe not.
We played half-one, but not twelve.
Block Rusky Birlows in front of play-off on OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markéta Sluková and Barbara Hermanno in the area in front of the play-off on OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Conclusion: Since we've played the last two games in a group of ten, we've had the regime already moved.
This was two more hours ago.
It's special, I can't imagine that another sport has a sportsman who has to give his best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and it's probably not gonna have a favorite time to play.
How do you value the Olympic experience?
Herman: Since the process from our target group was, it's fine on one side.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the party.
Conclusion: I'll get out of it, and I'll be on the Olympic tournament only positively.
The big brother's here, comes the first chilling SIM.
Don't leave her.
The new rules shall apply to all persons without a Thai passport who, while residing in Thailand, decide to organise SIM with one of the local operators.
Thus, not only on tourists but also on people with long-term visas who, for example, work or close marriages there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Communications and Telecommunications Commission Takorn Tantashi also announced that there will be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan for highly targeted foreigners was presented by the National Telecommunications Regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures which allow monitoring of their positions to be carried out by the authorities for six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security that will allow the criminal activity to be handled by a just foreigner.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs have help to withdraw persons who exceed the allowed duration of their stay.
The sellers would have to disclose a special SIM to the Thais in the course of the month of the month of that year.
The details will be the direct monitoring function that will be permanently suspended in the case of designated persons without the Thai passport.
She won't be able to escape.
"This function in SIM for Thai is not because you can always be easy to track," adds Tantashith.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand there are no anonymity as in Czech.
The seller requires evidence of authenticity.
On the other hand, a few years ago one of the operators released a free start-up SIM to tourists on the airport.
They were so anonymous.
The implementation of the same measure as Thailand also includes ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore.
There is also a mandatory SIM registration in them at the present time, although the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measures adopted do not mean that the national authorities are obliged to establish themselves upon entry into the country of the local operator's SIM.
Of course, Romaing services can be used with their own domestic SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be brief.
Operators of the given country shall know only relevant network information after crossing the border and after reporting SIM to their network.
They know the phone number, but they never know about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices between local operators' rates is so cheap that most tourists are also looking at local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners from foreigners living in Thailand have been legally expected to face immediate criticism.
Tantashith is satisfied with the situation and, in relation to the protection of the private security system, the obligation to provide residence addresses in immigration documents.
The police will also need a court order if it is necessary to monitor specific persons.
Any abuse of the system will be a threat to an unhindered punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantashith added.
The system should also maximize and use prepaid cards.
While it is currently possible to recycle a specific number up to 90 days after the expiry of the 90-day period after the SIM did not sign up to the network, it would be possible, in the event of the release of Thailand, to come back to the number within fifteen days.
Luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohradch has a pool and a terrace.
Why did you choose to be in the new building?
We've been looking for an old-fashioned apartment where most of the managers are looking for property.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and shelters in the house, which was essentially disqualified by the old constitution.
It's not about problem acoustics in old houses, problems with flooring, high energy efficiency and similar.
There were also large terraces, which the old constitution is not able to offer.
More interesting visits will be found in the magazine Modern apartment.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer with his colleague Kamilo Polákov from Artiga's study.
Why did you just say it?
Would you recommend cooperation with each expert?
In cooperation with the architect, we would recommend to everyone, if he proposes to stay from the beginning, it is also a very complex technical process.
The second row is the unique interior design: designers have a much better view of the school of possible materials and, on the basis of the customer's request, they are capable of smoothing the interior.
We have already worked with architect Lenko Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and given that everything worked well, there was a clear vote for us in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohradach.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We assigned ourselves a large community-based living space with the corresponding land for a quadrilateral family known as modern, but not a cold interior.
The priority was to determine the combination of the apartment with the terraces and to achieve intelligent household control.
And, of course, it was supposed to be a quality of implementation.
Did you leave everything on the board, or did you put yourself in the final form of the interior?
We have accepted all proposals including technical drawings and models of materials, although the proposal has always been taken from architects.
At first, we decided what we expected from the design, and showed some of the characteristics of the interior that we would like to include in the proposal, such as the copper or the image.
I think our collection of Czech authors including Karla Malicha, Karla Vysushila, Václava Špala or Otto Gutfreunda architect helped to focus on our experience.
The combination of black, white and orange trees was the idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, copper, textiles, art, etc.
Did you find any complications that you had to give up on your original ideas, or did you agree to a new one?
Almost in the initial phase of the project, when we arrived at the building at the moment when it was first possible to appear at the height of our base, and found that the views we had planned were actually the walls of the surrounding building.
At that time, we've changed the equipment from base through the night.
The salt was used on the kitchen line and on the roof of the blood walls.
In the interior, wood surfaces are then filled with skin, for example, with food and barbed wires of Norma from Arper.
How would you describe the inside?
Do you want any changes or something you want to have today?
I mean, it's about a modern air interior, which, above all, fulfills its purpose.
We don't know the changes, the majority of the repairs after moving are played at the level of painting and killing today.
Almost the only way out is by showing us the orange tree as too clumsy to the pet home.
Slovo Architects, Ing. Arch. Lenka Langera and MgA. Kamila Hornyyov, authors of the execution.
Being in the last floor of the new building, it was possible to complete the new arrangement and several other adjustments within the building.
The interior is an important first location of the lighthouse into the corridor and the main toilet.
That's where we got the light of the day into the darker room.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom on the air-conditioning terrace to the USSPA pool is one of the building repairs that were very useful for the whole apartment.
The participation is also a pool and a pool.
You're not negative compared to Francozi, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're coming from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are the origins of Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a Spanish cousin.
I've had enough to move.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon, and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in one store.
So why did you decide to leave the country?
I started to feel like I'm in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I've come to realize that every Francouz is very negative.
People in France have been negative about finding out in general, but in recent times it's still getting worse.
It's interesting that you're talking about real negativeism.
Some people also value such a Czech attitude.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to Francois.
Some people don't think it'll happen when they come to France because they don't care about it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel they have a little money, and the minimum probability in France is fifteen euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with people's behavior against Muslims.
It's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look through my fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm a bad guy.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for work anywhere else, and I've found a free place in Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now and I can't imagine I wouldn't live here.
Was that a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't get any negative reaction or pressure, but I feel people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress up anyway, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is still looking at you uncomfortable, perhaps when you have special clothes and the same.
In Prague, I started to seem really free.
I don't think people are asking for such things.
Where are you working now?
After working in Air France, I was working for a travel website.
Then we set up another friend's website that people offer and search for shared accommodation.
We're just moving to Prague, but we'd like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I've got two very close friends here who are Czechs in half, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that another specification of the Czechs is that it's going to hold more and more apart from the beginning.
He won't let anyone go to his body right away.
It's quite different from the place I grew up in.
They're all interested in the South and they like the face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You said you didn't speak Czech.
Is there a language barrier problem for you?
On the contrary, I have a lot of simplicity in Prague because almost everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And since everyone gets to communicate a little bit in English, I don't need to learn that language fast.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you ever met with some negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Basically not.
Maybe it's also because I work in the international environment, which is more tolerant.
One experience hits me.
My leader, Czech, once told me about the French football team and brought something into mind: They're not French, but Africans.
That touched me pretty much.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, it didn't happen to me yet.
And even though my colleague once warned me of some anti-immocratic demonstration.
He said don't go to the center, they're gonna give me that.
The anti-terrorist demonstration is primarily related to terrorist attacks.
How does the situation affect you?
You're afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I'm safe in Prague.
But the problem is that today can happen anywhere.
I must have been unable to imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
In addition, violence does not even recognize violence.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel tired and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I try not to follow those reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's actually not my fault.
I'm completely different, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at the location of Jiří from Poddebrad.
In the middle of the Middle Ages, Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated their opposition to violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that people feel they need to prove they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they should do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Are you meeting in Prague with other Muslims?
For example, my colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I do, so sometimes we have quite a debate about Islam because we think it's a little different.
I'm leaving France, so I went to another school, and they must have taught themselves Illustratively at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People in Islam sometimes associate with the underprivileged status of women.
How do you think?
I don't think I'm under any circumstances.
It's going on.
I'm a woman, I have power.
It's also related to that you don't wear any hair cover.
For example, a hygienic?
And it's mostly about how I was raised.
My mom, for example, is a fundamental Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he doesn't just wear a hat.
She always taught me that faith is a clean personal thing.
It depends on every way she interprets it.
When the human being reads the Quran, he should have his own opinion on these matters.
So when I read in the Qur'an a passage that says God has told the Prophet to hide his wives in the sight of others, I said, "I am not a prophet's wife, why should I hide myself?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I have to go to Iran or South Arabia, where the tents are required, I'll take them.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
Yes, I am.
I never felt so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but it's great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Praha is an ideal city for that.
A number of Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated their resistance to violence.
The Kosellian Fencl wind in Ríu has taken over the history of the past.
Sailing on the sea in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, the Czech explorer Veronice Kozelské Fenclóvé.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved in front of the final two explosions in ten places.
This would ensure that Chechnya participates in the final race.
You'll pick up the bacon.
They want to compete with transporters.
With the intention of using already planned transportation routes, the TV director Matéj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Gregor.
With the mind, three applications with a different geographical approach breathed life.
The national applications of the Movement were released in May.
At this time, there are thousands of cities in it, and we'll expand the network.
In Czech, we want to learn this first, more than we focus on abroad, says IDNES.cz, a four-year-old manager.
How does the transfer application work and who can enjoy it?
You'll take her away and register for free.
Then you can assign a track and information on how much big ball you can carry and how much you want to carry.
Someone's asking for transportation that day.
When the route and the time of delivery are fulfilled, it shall be repaired and the two shall be notified separately.
At this point, the chat is open where the two of them are talking.
How many people do you think I'd have to register in order to always find your kitchen?
I don't know the ideal situation, I can't tell how many registered and how many roads are needed to cover the whole optimal and each offer is in line with the request.
It's already working on the main roofs, and it's more logical than it needs to be on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and precision.
People still build their trust, and they find that no one's going out with the ball.
You haven't been able to solve this case yet?
How many users do they have a job after two months of landing?
We currently have about 5 to 6 thousand people who create roads.
We think it's a success and we believe they'll fight next time.
Don't you think it's safe for the sender to wait too long?
We hope that we will be competitive for large conglomerates now only because we are able to give something to another day and to break the price.
In a large donor company, you will be paid a couple of thousand dollars.
You're gonna pay a hundred and less here because it's a road that somebody's already running.
Should traditional transport into the future be afraid of the possible death of customers?
We hope so.
The market has a huge potential, it is growing here by the size of international transport, just like the commercial grid where everyone started buying and gradually found that quality does not match what he pays for.
No one wants to be found on the cover of the list, I swear, he's got to pick up his shirt on the side, and that's the first time that day after 19 hours.
At that time, however, I needed a package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't harm anyone and send a signal to try.
Marek Gregor (41) and Matej Liška (39).
Not one of them ever acted in the field of information technology.
Marek Gregor works as the director of the music club, Matéj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, Shippanne LTD began to prepare applications, which are used to refurbish the already planned routes between the world's metropolis, in particular the airport.
In 2015, the project was launched to develop a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three fourth years and the applications placed on the market in March 2016.
The application of the Transfer started to develop in the spring of last year and released this year in the spring.
It's about the local version of Shippanne managed for the Czech market.
The Mesik and Mesik Profi applications developed from the summer of 2016 and made users available to them at the end of July 2016.
The aim has been to do all these applications from the start, which one day connects into one.
In Czech, they want to govern the application and then to focus more on the global market with a strong investor.
The shared economy is recently the topic and this service is the type of AirBnB or Uber.
Don't you have any concern about the action in the area where no one can tell where the sharing boundary is and where the economy is sitting?
It's the same as another product.
It is clear to us that if it is successful and we are going up there, we will be able to take another step in the direction of the economy.
But although someone saves and does, it is not intended to administer financial authorities and tax controls.
Every user, whether on the one or on the other, will be forced to pay his income if he does so.
What makes you think the service has such a great potential?
The sender will save and the carrier will make, and will reduce the costs on the road.
There's this strong thought that's related to interest on both sides.
In times of social networks that divide people, we would like this to get closer.
They can make nice stories, people are happy to help someone and they'll tell you about it.
Maybe someone will bring you some forgotten glasses, keys or bags.
People, according to me, for a long time, lack personal access, we say this application is the service of people.
So how do you promise that the chicken with the ball doesn't stop?
Each user of the application together with the registration shall draw up a public record and enter a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give service and trust to man.
Curriculums also collect stars on the basis of the assessment of senders.
We'll also offer insurance, we'll still be on board.
In the event of an unsecured injury or injury, the custodial hand shall not be liable in accordance with criminal law for content if there is something illegal within it and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed package in his suitcase or ten kilos of heat, he will be liable to the sender.
Don't you mind using sensitive data from the database?
Registrations are, if necessary, by the supervisory authority which will be able to monitor it as the only option, or we ourselves are unable to see them, data are protected against abuse.
How much money will you get after a successful delivery of the necklace to your hand?
The cook determines the price and gets the whole amount he's gonna say.
The sender shall calculate a number of percentages more for the mediation of the contact.
These money is our profit, but it's just a few percent because we want to press the volume.
And no one can claim that the syringe has not been added when it actually delivered, taken and delivered is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether it's about the size or the contents of the package?
You can move anything.
We've got three sizes, a little as a bone of butter, medium as a flat egg and big as a beer bag.
Then there's no further restriction and if anyone has a seat in the car, he'll have to carry the refrigerator.
Plus has an opportunity to take a photo in the package app, so the cook sees what he wants.
You don't even need a ball if you don't want to hide the contents on the screen.
You're gonna throw the left mouse into your hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea, and how long was the service going on?
Kamarad's got an idea over two years ago, when I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with an international touch that aims primarily at traveling aircraft.
At the time, I told him I wouldn't look for an investor, but I would like to become his own and give him a break.
The next year, there was a long-term development before we founded the company Shippanne LTD in London because of the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on.
No, marketing was aimed at Česko, where we're trying to overcome the application, because it all had a birth disease and it's always a good deal to solve and improve.
We're trying to react to the feedback from customers and the foreign market we're not doing so much right now.
We know it's a long run, but we don't understand, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippancee LTD was the basic and most expensive applications, the other two were in their way of upgrade.
The transfer has resulted when we said that the national segment can be far more interesting and that at least we'll learn in Czech.
The third Mexico app is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the second end of the world.
It works for the senders the same as the Movement, but the difference is that you see in it as a courier in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geologist in the mobile.
Applications for whores who want to live there, we called Messek Profi.
So, can anyone be surprised to find out that he's going to get out of town?
Exactly, the last application will take place in Prague needs a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to take the road to work.
Now that everybody's fucking with those monkeys, they can pick up this whole thing.
The person sees where the orders are in the city, he comes to it, clicks, and sees when it has to be delivered and the transfer is taken.
It's more flexible than the competitive service.
At this point, we're still making web-based solutions that will be sensitive to companies to send backups, to the web to fill out information about them, to create points on the map.
Then we're able to use the service every month.
Now you owe the project to full consideration?
It bothers us, but we have it normally when we are employed so that we can enjoy and develop the project.
We're not hiding behind a strong international investor, we're two guys from one of them who had a brilliant idea, and one of them got mixed up with other ideas and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor that's strong enough to control the Czech market with us, but who should go with us to the world product and become another large player on the market, such as AirBnB and Uber.
The Rigid Part of Titanfall 2 should bring such a forgotten passion.
This will make the second part and the only game in it will be more transparent, according to the first information than in Call of Duty.
The length will move around the standard eight hours, and the filling must come directly from the food of the network in the first part.
It is therefore possible to enjoy the freedom of movement that includes, in addition to running, the possibility of using a battle titanium.
In addition to the action puzzles, the game will include the level of right-to-left movement.
They'll remember the plates and include the ribs.
Therefore, they are a major example of double jumps, running through the air, and the wool club.
At times, it will also require the removal of enemies.
There will be no lack of memory maps and, at the same time, special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to lift and collect the plates and close the possible door.
That's how you'll manage the same kind of war.
The time of the game should thus distinguish between the noise action and the quieter moments for the search of unknown planets.
We're going to play for Jack Cooper's bats on the pilot's career.
Cooper at the start of the campaign, along with Captain Lastimos, spent his time on Typhon's foreign planet, where the enemy soldiers live.
And he's like him, there's no such thing as that.
In addition, in the summer of summer, the Lastimoss is holding deadly wounds, and Cooper will therefore be given the task of delivering the captain titanium.
His dream of a pilot's career is so full before he's expected.
First step, but stealing the battery will be necessary for the robot's repair.
They're gonna be famous, and they're gonna talk to Cooper with Titan.
Players are served as a source of information about the past of the military, but they will also create humorous moments in the robotic communication.
For example, if titanium is going to be too much to mention all the injuries that Cooper is threatening at the planned altitude.
First information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was provided by the Polygion server.
In addition, it will be possible to judge for two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions from the games.
Titanfall 2 comes on October 28, and it's for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ signal heals, however, the original publisher remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic is renamed THQ Nordic.
After a short period of time, THQ also received a series of characters and rights for the use of the logo and company name.
Nordic thanks to this, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnic Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, there are 23 other companies and 13 of them have not yet been released.
Three and a half years ago, when I went to bed, my wife, after three decades of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first of all, she obviously tried to spend more time with him, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, because she's walking with a guy like that in front of me.
She's completely out of her mind.
On the first day, she even changed her voice, and she had such a beautiful voice.
But when I told her I know what's going on, she sang it.
But I noticed it all.
He went from work regularly to half a fourth, so she always went to three to buy.
She tried to see him at least every day.
Later, I came to see him in the bar, in the office.
How many times did I know they were there?
I've got my keys, he's decided I'll get there.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed at home.
I've never been there to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife has dominated me mentally.
She soon found out I'm capable of doing what she wants.
And I did.
Maybe I'm just such a bastard.
At the same time, my neighbors showed me that he knew about it too.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all worked out, it would be bad.
That it's going to happen in the family to everyone, it's just a daughter's shower.
So I always denied it, continued and continued.
But once I went after him to live with him, I'd need some practical help.
He went there with me, and I told him I got anonymity that he was dealing with my wife and that he's all right.
I asked him what he'd say to me.
He stood there, raised his arms, looked into the earth, and didn't say a word.
Then I met his wife on the way out of the store at the same time.
I told her that, but she didn't believe it at all.
She never answered that and she didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me anything at the time.
I'm such a man who never went too far, who has a problem getting to know someone and then finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always been focused on the end of the day.
I said I'd forgive her all and life's going on.
Yeah, but it wasn't.
And I've never really dealt with it.
I've got it in me this afternoon.
I used to give her a lot of light, but I finally left it for rest.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's house.
The house has always done everything - it's burning, it's empty, it's stuck.
She's working.
She always tried to keep me from having another reason to worry.
And it can be said that it's nice.
But sometimes I want to look at her, cover her, and she's leaving.
Together we go to shopping, shopping, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
She liked me, but she didn't love me.
And I see his love today, it's her God.
And that's not my life.
I told her I didn't want to live, and I asked myself what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree with it or not.
And I wanted to hear from her, yes or no.
But she thought, and she finally said, "But there's plenty of places here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French Islamic mission that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim citizens.
Following terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists and calls for government and local Muslim minority.
"If Muslim states themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be more difficult for France to guarantee freedom of expression," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He was willing to make sure that only spiritual education was available in France.
He also wants to stop funding from abroad, when money often comes to tellers of jehade.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wanted to set up a new French Islamic mission to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim citizens.
The new institution is reimbursing the current French grant for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
She had already contributed to the review of the financial flows between the towns and the countries to which their construction was financed.
Soon, though, she was attacked by internal conflicts, and she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
The former Minister of the Interior and the Defence of Jean-Pierre Chevnement, who is known as the rest of the secular state, will appear on the front of the new award.
In France, there are some 2,500 Masses and prayers, about 120 of them serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities from the country have raised 80 Islamic clergy and in a number of other decades they have seen this step.
This week, she was also a German police officer against the Jewish spiritual police.
The Mamams had reportedly fought warriors for the Islamic state.
One of them carried out a space where the believers were deliberately radicalized and later burned at the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate on a new institution that does not pay for its non-functional burden was launched in France.
All confirmed other terrorist attacks carried out on the name of the Islamic State.
The new commitment will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of the blend of domestic resources and also to take into account our own.
However, it is not yet clear where it will receive funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee on the meal hall, and in particular on the meat coming from the garbage in accordance with Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid to the sellers in practice for food, which is for the provision of permission.
A lot of money would travel right into the grant budget.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French immigrants who are going to Mexico.
Every year, they travel from France to the traditional South Arabia.
In French museums, only indicators that have passed the educational programmes at the foreign universities should be conducted.
As a result, their statements should be in accordance with democracy.
The government also has radical mixes.
"We've been closing them 20 times since December and they'll follow," said Minister Bernard Cazeneuve inside.
"In France there is no place for those who complain of hatred and disrespect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown shooter on Friday afternoon at the shopping center in the northwestern state of Zaragoza, says the Independent newspaper.
The shooting came after the women and the girls left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping center from where he started shooting.
According to the witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes Independent.
A woman took an unharmed daughter to the hospital, and she had to get a sanitizer for a man in a critical state.
It was made about 11.00 in the central metropolis of the Aragonia autonomous area, near the local university.
With a call to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes Independent that the motive was probably unsolved by the recent divorce of both partners.
The bonds with the Christian, the chains, the spring and the chilley.
It's a year before we've got a light, good food, but we're just a bunch of rebels and we've got our hunger and our head.
And so from the summer garden, there's a giraffe-knock-knock-knock-knock-knuck-knock.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, yet with the exception of salt or covered vegetables.
True, heating is slow for time and time, but it is a social concern and no one should be locked in the kitchen.
But there are also other alternatives, such as good tastes, which special tablemaking, their preparation represents a little ritual, but there is no need to create a little bit more, five or less or a soul.
And they still contribute to our health.
Whether it's a domestic sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-encumbered griffs make it possible to have fun and to eat the only real exotic meat.
The same as the easier roll in the rice paper from today's recipe.
Even here, there's a time-consumer heating and cooling of the river.
The paper can only be moved into the water for a moment, and then it's only about the imagination of the cook, how she likes to play with the fillings and supplements.
It's not like rice.
A number of Asian cuisines are coming out today and that raw materials are already available.
Incl. a pre-filled sugar-stained product, which is one of the basic sweeteners that provide sushi or pure roulettes.
You can also prepare it at home, but the right rose giraffe has a unique picnic island and also a delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it mixes from several species of octopus and plant.
Therefore, it is sufficient to buy a bag of the corresponding size and the Annex with the indicative antibacterial effects, supporting pregnancy and restlessness against cough or cramps is ready.
Banana lists.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in the worship and acquisition of animals in the context of the most diverse holiday opportunities and rituals.
Long-term hijacked banana leaves are also widely distributed in a number of countries in Asia or South America as a "help" for the preparation of the most diverse bread, cheese and mixed foods that are used in the same way as the apple.
The banana leaves are also supplied with a specific ingredient.
We're allowed to buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even before they're set up for a bicycle.
However, select only the list of green grids, and then healthy and unscathed.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salads from the roots of camouflage, sesame, and sesame oil.
He can also buy another frozen one.
Anyone who often prepares or prepares sushi will probably know a lot of noise.
In Japan, there is one of the most important types of marine rice made from which the nuts are made by cutting, cutting and drying the so-called nori leaves – so the payments are intended directly for the production of sushi.
Wakame – dark green rice growing in the waters along the Hokkaidó islands – is also fresh and dried and is equally popular as rice nuts.
By contrast, those who do not know the meat of the cow are likely to be used by Asian women for the purpose of birth control.
And in fact, this kind of effect is almost miraculous.
Blood cleans, strengthens the blood circulation, even deliberately prohibits hair drying and is actually covered with mineral substances.
The dried and crushed wax also serves as a turning point, for example, for the cooling of the river.
The fresh roses are first allowed to disappear in the water, then spread, insert into the warm water, and half a minute fire.
Then it's in ice water, it's in the middle of the bridge, and it's done, it's probably like a favorite salad.
Buying her already ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
Thus, it is only possible to change the role of a simple green filling, light and light, full of healthy senses.
That's a long time bomb.
If you get out and don't come back, you'll have a glass of glass.
Eat healthy, easy and cheap.
The Asians know how to do it.
There are a few special raw materials and a little flexibility, and you have an interesting fresh food that easily combines taste.
And it's done twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of wheat, 40 g of white wheat, 100 g of green wheat, 60 g of salt, 60 g of wheat of barley and 60 g of sweet chili of wheat.
The root of the dried root, the lichen of the black sesame, the lichen of the chilli beads, 20 g of manganese and 40 g of the dried root, a few pineapple roots.
First, we're going to get the prisoners ready.
We'll borrow the rice paper for five Tuesdays into the water.
We'll take her out and wait until she's gone.
In the midst of hot water, we will soon face the Christian challenges, and after three minutes we will quickly get into ice water to avoid losing color.
We're going to put on a paper that's full of greenery and we're going to put it on.
In addition, we prepare white cloths, candles, and salad cakes, which we put on delicious noodles, we smile at them with sweet chilli sauce, we add a cut-off corridor, we basically wash them and insert them into the rice paper.
On the banana leaves we put Christian benefits, add spices, and end up with a lot of eggs, a bowl of pasta, a cup of butter, a black sauce, and a couple of pineapples.
The British has to calm down with the silver in the seventh round, the Fijian selection takes gold
The random performance of the Great Britain in the seventh grade ended with a queer step at the last break, Fiji broke into the final trap on the fourth night of Britain at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio High 43:7.
The Fijians presented a master lesson in processing, composers, inspirations, support games, race on the throne and brutal forces - and obtained gold, their first Olympic medals at all.
The plague came with an unencumbered price of escapes in the form of silver medals - for Britain's third day - and the British could be on their way to the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seven-week band of the game, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic.
A faithful victory over South Africa 7:5 in the semifinals of the same day, she may have died in the finals.
In its form, Fiji would defeat a 15-member team in full health.
At least it won't work for the British network, but they can be pleased that at least one of them will have a gold medal tomorrow around the church: the main Fijian poet is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain hit the road.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, every game was lost in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost their only one here.
This mess hurts, but progress is unstoppable.
Fiji's beginning to be a big fan, and the British prostitutes showed up for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other players, it was like running behind a series of buses on the move and the world's championships led to 5:0 when Osea Collins landed behind the edge of the bridge.
The timer indicated four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion took place.
12:0 and Britain is struggling with the sword.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the giant Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from covering his body, but only the Fijians failed.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalu went to touchdown to the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one, and for hours it still remained more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravov then passed through the tiny Britts and reached the bottom where he was caring for.
After the conversion to paragraph 29:0, the suspension was followed.
It was like Fiji was born for the 7s race, while the British were still learning to surrender.
That's exactly what it's like.
The British, after the season, made a huge change and the Fijians' force stopped... for four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant border of Fiji Josua Tuisova went on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for Britain, put the touchdown into the left corner on an increase of 36:7. But the party has already won a long time by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans sang on the streets, had flags and dances.
It was hard not to be surprised by the very well-being of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Vilami's next attempt to win the Fijians has failed.
She called the gunman, the Fijians were fighting, and the British fell on the truck all over the way.
Just before that same day, Fiji broke Japan 20:5 in the semifinals, and Great Britain won the South African Republic in the secret semifinals - a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got South Africa in the first half of the run, but Dan Norton, thanks to his hard work, crossed the defense line and took care of the second half under the hat.
The great late cousin of Marcus Watson, Brother Anthony of the fifteenth team of England, provided victory - and in the end a silver medal.
Helen Glover's and Heather Staningo's victory in the space race inspired a coach's fight with cancer
You can't find more emotional gold on these games - and that's what to say.
From the first imprisonment to the last, during 220 punishments in history, Helen Glover and Heather Staning found another meaning in their golden moments at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two, three voices in the boat. When the ship lit up by the cold against the second Olympic gold behind him in the race of the two women, there was still voice in the boat with the current coach Robin Williams. They were the first women in the history of the British sports that had such a result.
Their behavior was absolute, totally their 39th race, in which they remained unconfirmed.
What we see is two outstanding athletes, as after the water cooler flying with elegant labyrinths - does not reflect the spirit of victory altogether.
For every golden medallion from the ceremony, the Battalion is a handy hand that stands out as different. And no hands were helpful more than the coach's hand, which he didn't know 30 months ago whether he was alive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his word, that was not true.
I've endured the cancer of a powerful mixer that can operate, and I've been under this operation.
It could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
Sometimes it changes your view of things.
It was discovered by Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the whole trio, it was possible to initiate treatment at the beginning of 2014, except for the season, and to reduce the impact at least - if that is what we can call it.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That's what it was.
I was in the hospital and I went after room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet in time when they said there were enough steps.
That's how it started.
Making a promise is just a road, but it was something more special.
Not long after his victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous early in the morning, were more than usual when he tried to control his own unhappiness.
Staningo, captain of the Royal Deployment Board, who has a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotions on the day, it may be a little extreme, but it means so much. ”
Again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked with, and Robin, too.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he belongs to a great thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't get a better man for a coach or a better dog.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning didn't win the only race in five years.
The two set up a playing rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to arrive, Staningo and Glover had a very large reservation.
At the very least, we focused on the moment.
Helen cried, "Don't give up, don't give up."
It's really important to get rid of the waste.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we couldn't get anything famous.
We weren't happy with the fire today, but we just wanted to go out and win the race that led us.
We'll take two years to think before they decide what's going to happen.
Glover's next week is married, with her rising TV welcome, Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, there were about six months before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.
Sitting on the first line to the characteristic architecture of the Central Library in Los Angeles
The history of architecture/South California Capter organises meetings with Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, authors of the new book "Central Library in Los Angeles: the history of its art and architecture".

It is necessary to purchase an entry: SAH/SCC 15 USD, non-USD 25.
Open industrial air in the DTLA is covered by permanent suspensions.
Celebrate with us the 90th birthday of the Central Library in LA. What's next? - a new book?
Connection?
Even if he's driving people free, he's saying the hunter's taxifie Rubeš to an excessive regret.
Six taxis and former Magistrate Officers in Prague are, as the ČT has pointed out, regrettably.
You've gone through a series of reports in which you've abandoned the double practices and those who should be in a group that will be before the court.
Because of this, you've got a few disgruntled movements with isolated actors.
How much is the report of the members of the organised group going through to you?
I was hoping he'd come to some court.
I'm mainly aware of the judgment.
But I don't think they should be in prison.
It's nothing.
First, they should return all the money they've earned.
And they should return them so they'll drive all the people free.
It's kind of a curious solution.
Does that mean that you do not take any punishment as effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them have such fear that they don't work here anymore.
For example, one makes a ping, another solves a pizza, and one is completely exposed to it.
Apologize can theoretically get two to eight years of imprisonment.
Is that an adequate rate?
I'm generally in trouble with freedom.
I think it's a bad punishment.
To close someone in prison, especially in such a case, is unreasonable.
Such people should return the company they took.
In the fourth century, however, they succeeded in ruining the name of our country and stealing people.
So now they're making a good visit and they're making people free of charge.
I can't imagine it otherwise.
It'd work like a public promotional job.
Like someone's going to collect waste, they'd get a car and free of charge to drive people on the beach.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and it'll be one of them.
They're gonna find another way to get in someplace.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Písku and then at the University of Tomasé Bati in Zlyna.
She looks at people who started with official videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as an online TV editor for Stream.cz, where he participates in a series of series, now prepares the Prague Guide series, which is specially designed for foreign audiences.
This Rubesh is a form of short-term reporting that I prefer to avoid in Prague and which is rather recommended without fear of using it.
Previously he started a series with names How to it, The City of Controversy?, Life in luxury, A enough! and Praha vs. Prachy.
Unfortunately, they are spoken of as an organized group.
The police have been watching her for months.
Can such a network of double taxis be identified as a mafia?
They're so beautiful mafia, not the one we know from Kmotra.
It's more about mafia - June, but it's definitely organized.
It's just that they're looking at each other's stamps.
Praha's all broken down.
I noticed, for example, that the main airport is not happy with Paris, Paris is not pleased with taxi drivers waiting in Karloví Lázní (disko club)
Everyone just looks at their place, and every group is organized.
It's obviously online.
But the suspects are just seven people, six taxi drivers and one former Magistrate officer who warned against the controls.
As you can say, the unsatisfying Jews didn't get out of the street.
What's the percentage between the peacocks in the taxi service according to your schedule, then?
It's a very small percentage.
They're still the worst on the street.
I'm talking, for example, about Alesh Ryjačk.
It's a man who's really dangerous - he's driving a telescopic bus in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he's at Karl's bridge and he's driving people.
When I finally went with him, he wanted me seven hundred in three miles.
His police didn't hold him for any reason.
Only a few people from the entire big group were selected.
The same is true in other Prague locations.
Unfortunately, seven people are making it hard to replace the famous porcelain, which seems to have much bigger size.
Of course it's not for anything.
It can help, but it's not all evil, it's true.
Are taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still at the same places as you showed in the reports, then at Karl's bridge or in the Paris street?
Yeah, that's right.
In these places they stand every day, and every day they break the records.
He ignores it as a city police, a prairie master.
It's not even cocurs anymore, but it's a little bit quiet.
Business of pig taxis in numbers
Nevertheless, some of them will be brought before the court only if it is part of the group.
It's half past half.
That's why I have to ask myself: Do you feel satisfied?
If I take it as a pleasure, it would be wrong, because my goal was, and it's always to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel it needs a little better, I'll continue to do it.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't calm down with that.
It's not like that, of course, they're more.
You're still trying to confront them directly in the taxis?
Sometimes I'm doing a test drive and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a taxi driver outside the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He calculated 560 kroner in three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was 56 kroner (he used a triangle with a ten-year mark).
He had the uniform, the police took him, and this taxi driver was so loud that he was still running after the cops and asked them when someone finally gave him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taxi overpassed a ten-year-old ticket and stole the tourists with 357 crowns.
Is it said that the mass of underwater taxis has not reached even after what you have shown in your meetings the faces of those who counted inexhaustible amounts for a short drive?
Their fingers are still unbelievable.
How did it happen to that cabman with 56 kroner?
The police sent him away because they couldn't talk to him at his place because he put an account.
And that's going to be, I think, a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and one executive).
On the one hand, there'll be a taxi driver with his accounts on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate shall not use secret deposits from the service taxi vehicle as evidence in the court.
When I found out about their subversives, the taxi drivers himself warned me about this earlier.
I'm a prisoner, but he always wanted to use only the report.
Do you have any fear that this reality could be protected before the court?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive six or ten miles per kilometer because he wouldn't use it.
You were talking about a trick with a ten-year-old watch, especially before foreign customers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about this file after your reporters are published?
I think we've popularized this trick by sending the order.
I recently went with a taxi driver, proud of me he's the one who's the right taxi driver.
But then I realized that from the side of the taxameter, they'd fit the black pen.
When I asked him what he had, he said, "You know what it is."
If the taxi drivers didn't work too hard, could they be punished with a court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can be done from both sides?
You've been talking about the way you think they'll always find themselves on the road.
I think it can't be done.
But someone from these places can shoot them.
And that's the fair taxis that should be more prepared to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience, I have to say that those hairy taxiers in Prague are taking advantage of their luck.
But do they want to go against those who tell the story of their services?
They want to have it, but they don't have a mind.
He can't go too far and he can't say exactly what they want.
When the demonstration was organized (on the proposal for a comprehensive limitation coming from Adriana Krnáčová's office), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
Once they said they didn't oppose Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they just blocked Prague and caused only the best possible advertising for Uber.
How will you fully appreciate the access of the Prague Master to solve the problem of driving?
It's obvious that she had to get in to the criminal police to get something resolved.
The Magistrate was short on it.
They had a map that provided information, which means that the taxi department had been doing its job for several years or so.
I hope that the officers will count on the last control of all measured controls to find out what he did.
That's what makes me the worst.
I was even on one control trip with him, which I found up to the next of their description.
A few months have passed since the last parts of the series were published.
What's the answer?
I'm thinking mainly of foreign monsters, which are actually the most focused series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'll show them this video.
And when we're going to the Old Town, it's amazing that the same people who're seeing at the castles really stand.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
But really.
I'd put a bullet around them so people would look at them.
The museum of communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
You're going to take a taxi when you need it?
Sure.
I'm doing services that I don't have to pay for, but a card.
I'm using services like Uber or Liffago, where there's no possibility of a flood.
But it's also a lot of dyspepsies that are free.
I've taken a taxi off the street since then only once.
After I got into the car, my driver said, "Well, you've got a train."
I'll be in a ride for the Italian tourist.
It was written in 2005 on the double practices of taxi drivers.
Paul Bém, a former prime minister in the same year, appeared on the control train in the Italian tour and immediately on the first attempt by her driver, opened up about two hundred.
Editor Rubesh had more experience.
The taxi drivers assigned him to travel from the Old Town to the Václavsk village of 820 kroner, up to 195 kroner per kilometer, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague Magistrate then established a maximum price of 28 kroner per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the surrounding report: for example, two-kilometre road from the streets of Paris to the Trullar State of Tourism 400 kroner.
The nice rides also provided taxis waiting at Karl's bridge.
On the way to Angel, which has 2.5 kilometers, they have to count six hundred rounds.
Mramor is extremely salty with clean water, which is the best without chemistry and the longer it is.
The uncleans of it are good, even though they sometimes have to be given down the stairs, they need to get rid of them.
It's not easy and it's not fast enough, it's close to her work as restorer, Vanessa Trost, from Oldrich's in Hawaii.
Klobouk down front of it: the grave is left with a body that needs to go out immediately and come down again.
"The restorationer should be gentle, patient and impartial at work," she said.
It's not far from her first restoration work in Frydlantsk.
Thanks to its restoration, for example, the stone fragments of the façade in the last track of the Frédlantian workshop were refurbished in Zatija, Saint John Nepomuké in Frédlant, Piet in the Frédlantsk district, Mariánský sloup in Frydland or atlanta in the middle of the spasnium in New City under Smurk.
With the reintroduction of Melchior, Krystofa and Katerini from Redden, Fryland began in 2011.
Now the surface of the stones shall be cleansed from the base of uncleanness, and the cross, which is made free from the piece of stone, shall be made sure against the floor and the floor; they shall be cast into the wall or to one another.
It's also waiting for soil healing and preservation.
The letters on the grave are re-enacted.
"Then begins writing on marble discs with a flat gold," said the rapporteur, the State Memorial Care of the City Authority in Frydant, Vera Sobot's Faith.
In the past, there is no record of the threat going through some repairs.
I'll take a closer look at the openings in the marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's about the rest after the funeral.
He was rich, but after the Swedish invasion of the Thirty Years ’ War, everything was broken.
The story was spread out, known as Sobots.
In the Church of the Holy Cross, the restorationers are peaceful in the home.
After the spring of 2010, it was necessary to provide for the collection of jars that were covered under water, the baptisms were restored, the flour put in the jar and now the jar.
"We would also like to leave ourselves in the future," Sobot said.
The church is different in very good condition, every year to maintain and correct the money.
Rehabilitation work on the restoration of the reddening will reach a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They'll be thrilled with the donation, instead of re-entering any of their money.
The hundreds of thousands of crowns are just winning in the country's Historic City contest in 2015, and the remaining 28 thousand crowns are then contributing to the ministry of culture, the old Frydante Dan Ramzer highlighted.
With regard to the release of the refund refund, the opposition decided.
Experts' views on future development on selected foreign markets have been monitored through the index and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of a month and a half a year.
On the market, low voice and growth prevails.
Who would say that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. index S&P500, which has passed 12% corrections today, is at a new historical level and has already been registered 7 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the irony rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have finally achieved theirs.
In the case where the American shares are at the historical maximum so long as they are currently the lowest since 2014, markets are now at peace and without fear grew thanks to the quantitative release of the American Central Bank and when the same rate as today's index voltality (VIX) remained stable below the 12 per cent threshold.
And so can not.
Although the Fed market continues to prepare for progressive increases in rates, quantitative liberalization in Europe and Japan has been in full progress and has also contributed to the Bank of England's work in the past six months, which will buy the debt of 70 billion pounds.
The new wave of quantification, therefore, has so low results that it will contribute to almost complete elimination of the risk and fear of the future.
How long will this situation last?
Of course it's a million questions.
In view of this, however, there is no present risk, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without further developments, the situation on the Commodity Market and in China is being stabilized and Brexit is no longer the subject, so we should probably not be surprised if American action continues in a similar calm state.
Unfortunately, Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I'm very glad my friend Michel Barnier took this important and important job.
I wanted to say, for this difficult policy work, the head of the European Commission Juncker, when the French policy (a really tried, because of the most diverse international political functions, that we would look for a better example, such as European elite, would be hard to find) called the European Commission's main executive of the Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's selection of notes hopes that the EU is in serious interest looking for future friendly co-existence with Britain.
However, most of the British media adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's military act.
Barnier is a leading European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He used it as he could understand it only: an enemy of the Anglo-American Free Market and a model of capitalism.
The existence of multilateral regulations was a co-founder of the concept of the Banking Union, and it was founded on all that comes from the London Financial Centre, which amended legislation to reverse the strict regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the struggle with London, will be a strong, non-smoker and obviously an invisible mediator.
It's probably not good news.
In this context, remember the calm and friendly division of the Czech Slovak Federation, which contributed so much to the development, transparency and capacity of Prime Minister Váklava Klaus.
And that's why today the Czechs can be the closest friends and allies.
Unfortunately, Juncker from Váklava Klaus - at least in this - didn't learn.
It would be good for everyone!
The earthquake around Putin?
The government of Kremlin has abandoned his neighbor Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Friday, proposed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
We'll take his place with Anton Vajno.
She informed the Russian media about this with a call for notification of the Kremlin printing service.
Putin then pointed out Ivan's surrender to his own request.
At a meeting that transmitted Russia's 24 television station, the president said he was going to meet Ivan's invitation on his way to the office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for no more than four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for the environment and transport.
The report on the exchange with the President of the administrative department, which is now taking Ivanov's staff representative, Vajno, is considered to be extremely surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is also marked by one of Putin's closest colleagues.
For example, in the past, this former KGB officer ceased the functions of the Minister of Defence and the Head of Government.
The President's term of office will now be abolished and the term of office of the Security Council.
Ivanov, in his meeting with Putin, pointed out that he was a long stay at the head of the Head of State, actually a recordman.
He's been in it for four years and eight months.
In this connection, he recalled that 11 people had already been set up in this function 25 years since its establishment.
Not even the poets of Stryc and Chafazar won't win the finals.
Not one of the five tennis matches has yet been able to turn into a final part.
As his first battle, Peter Quittė, who followed the Portuguese surprise of Monice Puige after the set 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
In a short time, the Czech Debtors also followed Stryk's.
Winners of the Williams Networks in the first set were behind the game, however, two sets were missed, and Russia finally used the set in a short game.
The second set was lost by 4:6.
The semi-final success in the afternoon program in Rio has been recorded by the Czech conspirator Ondréj Sonek with a view of winning his semifinals when the second Damira Martina from Croatia broke and was released almost a second.
Today's good, the conditions were great, the wind dropped.
I've been trying to shoot the most, I've got the son.
That's what his opponents had to fight for.
So some force has taken them, so this could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy. It's just playing in my car.
Mirka Topink's button, but she didn't run in the Snowdrops.
The five-year-old nurse has a fourth position in her race in the semifinals of today and is waiting for her to start at the B terminal and fight between 7 and 12 places on Saturday.
The gold from London doesn't work like that.
At first, I didn't get to the end of the Olympics.
I'm a little afraid of it, but on the other hand, I ate a quality race and I gave everything I had.
Soupers were just better, Topink's Knuckles got stuck in front of them.
She struggled to the end and believed that she would get in her fourth games between the sixth and the sixth.
The fight took off until the goal was clear.
I knew that the girls were just like that, that the field could get anyone out of it.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a fin.
And I thought I'd be able to get through Rakushank.
Unfortunately today, the life race has been eaten by the world's mystery since 2011.
Far behind the final defenses in Rio, a young shooter, Filip Nepejchal, who was not able to sell himself out of the qualification, this time a little bit in bed.
In it Nepejchal has a 33rd place.
Qualification was best for the Russians.
From the first story, Sergei Kamenskij came from 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepejchal's shot had a value of 620,5.
At the program in Rio, the athletes also spoke, including Czech weeklys Katerina Cachov and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachos belong to the second Olympic competition, the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinová is twelve.
The leader of the Britka Katarina Johnson-Thompson, which jumped up to 198 centimetres as usual as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiamo.
Both of them were responsible for the historic best high school performance in the seventh grade.
They still tried to jump 201 inches, but they failed.
German, Rus, who's worse?
When we consider the absurdity of such questions: The German society has gone through a deep seberflexia, which has nothing to do with Russians.
In both large european nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century and reached the power of regimes that were Dutch, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks contributed a large amount to 94 million victims of communism, which is indicated by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted famine, incompetence of war or of Negede experiments.
In a Nazi way, about 6 million Jews were hungry, and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
In the areas covered or left behind, Germany and the Soviet Union carried out their operations.
In Germany there were not only a few individuals in the SSSR, but a large part of the people took part in these crimes either actively, passively or only by beating their heads to the sand.
It's not just the specifics of these nations, we're as winner.
In Germany, without an immediate end of the war, denacification came, the Norimberg Tribunal.
But that's the most important thing that came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, my grandfather, why did you take part in such animals? ”
How could you do that?
This has led to real reflection and improvement of society.
Germany's elites are currently primarily concerned with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the prosperity of their citizens.
Now they also have other (often novaly idealistic) goals, but they are definitely not going to join back Alsasko-Lottrinsko or someone - to revanš - military attack - that is almost everyone knows.
After the war in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed over a thousand years when the former KGB agent (sic!) Vladimír Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The political path to Russia is rich, gaining lost lands, defeating the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of their own people are of no value to belief.
Fight yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only in the decades of the despotic regime that Russia is not genetic or culturally less - transferred to the Asian (self) Tiranë.
Who is promoting the growth of fuel around the Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In the past few days and hours, the situation has deteriorated at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region.
Who's getting drunk?
After a longer period of relative peace, further deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia came.
The Ukrainian side has become the island of Crimea, which has been joined for more than two years in Russia and is part of its territory.
The reports from both sides of the dispute are, of course, contradictory and it's difficult to verify them independently, so we can just think of an old-known question to whom?
According to a report from Moscow, there was a terrorist attack on Crimea from Ukraine, which is understandablely rejected by Ukraine and, rather, accused Kreml of proselytism.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in Russia has already been provided by the Savčenkovi pilots who have been informed that they have been in possession of Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, in what would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
Escalation of drinking around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further arrest of sanctions and the strengthening of the anti-terrorist campaign.
In the last year, an immigration crisis has taken place in Europe to draw attention to the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost all credit before its citizens when President Poroschenka's current support moves around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have long failed to be successful financial injections from the EU and especially MMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to pay more attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Porošenko and other members of the leadership of violent groups want to be shown again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up even to Russia.
It is only to be hoped that all those who try to resolve an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their huge responsibility for the lives of the soldiers, but all the ordinary people on both sides of the conflict and stop their enemy actions at the time.
Bulgaria’s first eight months showed inflation
According to national statistics, 1 % of the monthly inflation rate was reached in Bulgaria in June.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first zero value since October of the year when a smooth inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, for the last 12 months (June 2015 - June 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (June 2014 - June 2015) was -0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in June 2016 was 101.0 % in June 2016 and the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (June 2016 averages December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual rate of inflation in June 2016 was -0.2% in June 2015.
Unlike last month, in June 2016 there was an increase in the way of these consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Price decreased in clothing and clothing (2.2%), housing, household equipment and regular maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as last month, prices remained in alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. secret services were watching Russian hacker attacks a year ago.
Information on Russian attacks was made available to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that an attack was being held on the services of the country's central democratic community.
The Russian part of the attack is not discussed, but no official report.
Moscow was involved in an attack.
The report on the monitoring of a particular Russian attack was quite secret, because its expression would reveal that American secret services are monitoring and identifying the way they do it and the sources they use.
Two Russian reporting services were initially divided into attacks.
New cybernetic Security Advisory Committee
The Russian track material was coded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight main envoys of the Congress, called the United States gang of eight, were informed of public figures.
It is made up of two chief chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidential Democrats in both Nancy Pelosie and Harry Reid and four members of the Congress' defence and security committees.
The Head of the Democratic Party of Donna Brazil announced on Thursday that it would create a cybersecurity advisory body that should "stop future attacks and ensure the primary protection of the Democratic Party's servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in Albert's body.
The poet apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's health problem following the consumption of the food Losos wildly taken - tastes 100 g, consumption date 22.11.2016, they carried out an empty hygiene of control in the sales of Albert in Václavský and Na Móstk.
The control found that the L23012562/T4 butter with the consumption date of 22.11.2016, on which the customer warned no longer available, and therefore the product of the specific butter was collected with the consumption date 11.12.2016.
The laboratory investigation confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's about the parasitic worm of the trajectory of seabirds.
This is dangerous for a person - alarves in a body bed or a fish pool are a strong allergen and a man-made livelars can pass through a cold wall into the internal organs, Štich said.
Customers are very sorry for the problems in this brand.
We were immediately out of the sale and for preventive reasons we were also all the other sugars in this position.
There was a mistake on the side of the supplier we're dealing with, and at the same time we let this product be tested by ourselves, said Novinka's speaker Albert Barbara Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it to any of the chain stores and get the money back.
Larvy destroys the smell and sufficient heat repair
The salesman was Nekton-Vrnäta.
For the benefit of dangerous hygiene products, they were informed by the Prussian and Central Veterinary Administration.
According to the server for safety food.cz people may be infected with analyticosis, which may occur with chest pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may occur without a prescription, ČTK indicated.
The symptoms will reach an hour until two weeks after the consumption of less heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the start of the cancer, most of the cancer is spontaneously left alive.
Adults are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either in sufficient heat processing of fish or in freezing it.
The veterinary authorities have at present verified the salts and at the disposal of the imported product in the Mediterranean country.
Three of the five tested samples contained parasites.
The 1700 product supply arrived in ČR according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of the autumn.
Exposed, in the simple majority to the Ahold River, was to date 919 packagings.
At the present time, there is an increase in non-produced stock of the product from the sale, said the fifth ČTK SVS speaker Petr Pejchal.
The veterinary authorities immediately, following the finding of positive samples, prohibited the movement of other products from the stock.
The seven-year-old Britka wanted to get rid of Rakky, apparently killed her Russian flag.
After the initial shock and the rapid crash with the Jahadist who was interested in killing, there was an explosion.
The expected chalifat paradise changed for the British girls into a hell on a land where there was no one else.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halimo.
She called her back in Britain and made sure she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have an unintended order to shoot, The Telegraph quotes the lawyer of the family's kidnapped girl Tasnam Akunjeo.
The last steps went to Rakky, where the girl called the last.
Then there's only a report of her death that can't be verified.
Her family communicated with her from the apartment in eastern London.
They studied how she could get from Rakky and cross the Turkish border.
They hoped they'd meet the former student again.
But Cadiza was probably killed before she could get up because the house in which she was staying compared to a flowering country introduced the British ITV News.
TV added that the bomb had apparently triggered a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS farm in Syria.
You'd get blue from the sky just to get your child out of the danger zone, Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer, said.
In a week when Kadiza was thinking about a flight from the territory of the Islamic state, one Rakushanka was killed while trying to escape and, according to the information available, was publicly killed to death.
I think that you (Kadiza) put it as a warning and decided not to risk it, says BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from the school of Shamim Begum and Amiro Abas were released on the 17th of October.
They just said they're coming out.
But they headed for Gatwick Airport and from it across Turkey to the territory of the IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadiz back.
You'd get the blues out of heaven just to get your child out of dangerous areas and this family did everything she could to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking that they'd be caught by the lawyer.
The only positive point is that the Kadiz court can serve as a terrifying case for other girls or boys who are allowed to blame the Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went out there, realized how things were there, understood how far it was from the promises of the Islamic state propaganda, and wanted to come back," Akunjee continued.
Cadizin's associates are unknown.
But since they have also declined, their families have to deal with the possibility of the dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, he can go to the network without saving the crime.
For many years, the village of Inveraray was a national centre and a guide seat from Argill.
From the mid - 18th century, the court found himself in a labor camp and the saturin under the throne served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the persecutors lived were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them, and they're successful.
As a result, the city officials decided to move to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848, and it was much more exciting, heating and gas lighting in prisons.
Even though it was not long in operation, it was closed for economic reasons by the end of August 1889, since the lower repair device was costing the operation and did not pay too much.
The persecutions and the ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened a whole century later, visitors can compare the old building to a new one, to convince themselves how different conditions prevailed in them.
The originals in contemporary costumes are still refreshing.
It is also a painful place where visitors can learn what kinds of punishments have been applied to criminals, whether it has already been the breaking of fingers or the burning of a sign of the body.
In the context of the visit, tourists can be allowed to close to one of the destinations, most because of photos on the memory, or to introduce the feeling that prisoners live on the streets.
At the same time, the Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish locations, where it is likely to be worse.
There were already several groups of hunters of paranormal activities, and now the museum allows people to come to some ghosts to hunt.
That night, it's going to be 300 pounds, which is in the count of 9500 kroner.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, citizens also enjoy great food, surroundings, and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchatu is criticised as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially unfeeling.
The Snapchat application every day allows about 150 million users to change the reality and to play with the same methods that limit to absurdity.
You can make yourself ananas, a dog, or a stand that looks like it's coming out of Roye Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved self-restraints every day.
Any mistake will soon become public.
The Snapchatu filters have in the past served as a criticism of the claim that the app promotes blackfacing or that it supports the white cut off skin as an ideal beauty.
So when this week offered the users a filter, thanks to which they had smooth eyes, covered teeth and focused faces, some critics marked it as a racist Asian cartoon, "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated controversial questions were not pointing to more problems in society -- a problem with diversity.
In the middle of it, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and the explosions spread rapidly and Snapchat immediately indicated the next day that the function was broken.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was designed as an expression of the account I set anime, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who were witnesses to racism, the filter reminded sick stereotypes in action.
The rest of them have refused to compare with the animals.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose photo tweets were widely shared, indicated in an e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and painful.”
He added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the apparent Asian character and the effects of the filter.
It is shown that the filter is not only about yellow face (yellowface) but that the yellow face is attached to the red outer layer.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
The American culture seems to have an endless deal of diversity and including, from the seats of blues in Hollywood corporations and devices that we all carry in our hands.
And the vast majority of young people in Snapchat - which are more racially diverse than their older partners - can mean that they can expect even greater sensitivity.
"When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to some user," said 5th Katie Zhuov in the talk on Thursday, "it's very difficult to cover these things today without any attention as it was before."
Katie Zhuov, a product manager and designer who works for the Media, decided on Thursday to delete his account on Snapchat and call on others to do the same.
In the Media article and in the telephone discussion, she pointed out that racially motivated problems reflect a lack of diversity in the congregations of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuova criticized excessive whites, the whole male leadership company, and the article ended hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's just that there's no difference between employees and color people at the moment they decide on these things," said Zhuov, who has a Chinese-American reason, "or color people work there, but not on positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about."
Other observers share her opinion - the difficulty that Snapchat left in a significant measure without answering.
The company shall not publish the figures relating to the divergence of its employees with the status of private companies.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the language company, he recently adopted a collective worker who should focus on the inadequate population and on internal management.
The report adds: “I am aware of the need for other users who can say that this is wrong,” with the fact that their account will remain deleted.
The military officers drew up reporting information on IS, says the Parliamentary Committee
The Parliament's report, published in the fourth quarter, indicated that the officials of the Central Authority of the United States had changed the reports of the reporting services to express more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the country had provided for.
According to the preliminary report by the Working Group of the President of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Reporting Services and the Sub-Committee on Defence, "a wide range of discomfort" was found between the analysis of the Central Reporting Service, which their audits changed their assessment of the US efforts to defeat the Islamic state.
The Central Authority, known as CentCom, is a military center in Tampa on Florida, which is responsible for American military operations in the Middle East and in Central Asia.
The press release of the report states: “The outputs of the reporting secret services approved by the Centcom authorities have usually offered a more positive picture of the United States counter-terrorism forces than confirmed by the facts on the ground, and have been consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are injured when there is a false analysis presented by the overarching political elements," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and a Republican from California.
Traveling in the direction of Centcoma takes it up to the top of the organization.
The ten-star report describes in detail the persistent problems of the central state in the description and analysis of American violence in the training of the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no reasonable evidence that the senior representatives of Obama's administration have ordered the reports to be changed, the report indicates that the analysts had the impression that they were under pressure by the leaders of the Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State or the IS.
"In the first half of 2015 there were many press reports from the Central State, the announcements and reports from the Congress were essentially more positive than the actual events," the report states.
For example, the representative of the Centcom publicly announced that a major military attack on Moscow's invasion could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said Ambassador Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party of Kansas.
From the mid-2014 to the mid-2015 period, the highest level of staff of the Central State of the United States of America were manipulated with the exits of the State of the State with the aim of putting the risk of IS at risk in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after they learned about the concerns of analysts about the manipulation of information on the reporting services concerning the Islamic State.
After the report was published on Thursday, further examinations should be followed.
In the reporting services of the Centre, further investigations are carried out by the general inspector-General of the Ministry of Defence.
The Democratic Members of the Committee on Reporting Services have confirmed their own findings on Thursday, in response to some of the conclusions of the working group of the Republicans.
"Centcom has created a very difficult process between 2014 and 2015 to compile information on IS and Iraqi security components," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representatives of Democrats.
According to Adam Schiffa, this process “has led to overexpression of reporting services," he has damaged morale between analyticals and "not enough to take into account independent views."
However, Schiff and Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that White House would try to pressure Centco's analysts to make their conclusions based on "foreign or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
In August, Loni, New York Times informed about the ongoing investigation by the general inspector general of the Pentagon, who was initiated after the difficult analyses of the Centcom.
Commander Patrick Evans, speaker of the Pentagon, stated in the statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report, as the investigation of the general inspector still continues.
He noted, however, that "repudiators never agree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the reporting community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the framework of the question whether the United States is successful in the bombing in Iraq and Syria (the virus that now announces the growing number of defence representatives).
However, a low charge has raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the assessment of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The report's criticism of the Islamic state reflects conflict over more than ten years ago when an analysis of the reporting services to Centcoma Gregory Hooker wrote a research work in which President George W. Bushe's administration - despite many analysts' intentions - rejected a small unit in Iraq and gave only a little time to think about what will follow in 2003 the invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the intelligence services of the Islamic State.
Last year the authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite the public announcement of the return, the air forces against the refinery of the Islamic state were not able to recover the financial resources of this terrorist group, because the group was building temporary refinery and selling it on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the finding was not transferred out of the middle class.
The director of the Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then described as critical last year after many legislators followed the witness of the Senate to the very positive assessment of the war.
General Austin left in the deep and in the Centcom was replaced by the Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won the world hockey in the fourth series series, so today it's going to play the winning game in the Great Britain team
Katie Bamov, in the Battle against Japan, which ended with victory 6:1, shot three branches and only one day after the American Women's team of the underground hockey, shot the first two stocks in which the United States defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five pieces in two pieces are a good memory success, but Bamo (27) said it's not sure if something like that ever happened to her.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't look at those who write their own branches.
But he knows this: Americans on Olympic tournaments run at 4:0 and it's about the first place in the Great Britain group, which remained on Thursday after Japan 2:0 hits.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last stop of the first car.
The two teams qualified to the fourth final and the summit decided on who of the six teams will end on the first and who will be on the second.
The first team will avoid some of the mighty Danes who are on the heads of the second group.
As soon as Saturday's party ends, the Americans here have released their amazing ride, four years after the end of the 12 teams on the London games.
There was Bam's team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the hockey to the ground hockey first when she was 3 years old (her older sister played double in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at the time.
The Olympics won her in 2008 because she didn't get to the finals.
Then came 2012 when neither her nor the members of her team did much happen.
The next year was an English coach named Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural changes, mental changes, physical changes," said Bamová.
In London we didn't have a working pace like we do today.
We've done a complete job.
On Thursday night, Bamwa started in the first half of the branch fire in the vicinity.
India entered the castle without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprisingly hard and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bamov used the opportunity.
The only one on the left side of the playing field, then she called in the middle and shot the cat into the bank to get the Americans to drive 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last branch in half a quarter.
The U.S. branch office of Jackie Briggs, who helped one branch in each of the three victories, was the first on tour.
He's in a great way.
Just like Bam's.
"Now we're in a good place," said Parnham, but as good as it is, it's going to depend on the outcome of the Saturday season.
Blue trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Heating
There's one, there's one, there's one, how long it's been-- it's an Olympic.
From the experience in Rio de Janeiro, it is a feeling of enduring, unsatisfied and busy competition and effort.
It's like the Olympics themselves would be a juicy staphite bike that is handed over by a sailor, a gymnasium and a triathlonist.
You can't start television, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation at the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or the murder between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley too.
Dooley, an ex-girlfriend of a woman with glasses in her face, is at the Olympics first and could also be among those whose names are included in the houses in the main broadcast time between the advertising and sponsors' meetings, if he was a blonde, famous, or even a smermermer.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California is fighting Olympic gold in horses on trampoline.
The Olympic Fire doesn't shine on all the competitions at the same time.
From the middle, there are some sports in the stage that are not generally known: air gun shooting, lukostril, Badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always have success in classic blue-style - and it'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my favorite favorite, let me be warned of the sudden stroke of trampoline.
Although the jumps to the trampoline have been the Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced to the games in Sydney, this sport has remained almost unnoticed for 16 years. Many of the people I asked didn't know it was Olympic sport.
It could be regional hostility.
The United States never reached the trampoline jumps, and by 2012 none of the athletes had reached the finish line.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year the gold medals from London will show Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
Steps on the trampoline, however, have yet to be broken, partly because the unencumbered ear is more likely to appear to be more at the university than at the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not a professional, but just a superhero from the country.
It has a chemical potential - a comical vibration of endless reflection - but also the gravitationality of gymnasiums and subterraneans, two sports that combines itself.
The word "trappoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampoline", meaning "scokan disc".
The breathing shampoo jumps to a large trampoline, which shoots up to a height of about 10 metres and presupposes the components with a number of particles (salts, heat and combinations) before they finally reach their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and "airtimes".
In Rio it will compete with twelve athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
Olympian tractors are in front of us.
Soldiers of gold medals must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, and then back there, up and down.
It tries to reach not only the target sand or the start wall but also the television news, as well as another thought line: a world or an Olympic record.
This single-minded effort is noble, wonderful, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the monsters into the hole.
But I think it's just kind of frustrating when you're watching the Olympics.
Steps on trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The drag of the athlete on the trampoline is the direction of the top.
I don't mean to move forward.
He or she looks like they're in a state of no weight like astronomers, flying up, then down, and then again with no fingers up.
Without competition and of course not even difficulties, but after a long period of time, the system will not be able to achieve the goal, no distance, but only perfect, time-free and gravitational.
This is only the closest time the Olympics and the Sun are approaching.
Qualifications and finals of women run on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock of the east time, then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will finally be sent within the afternoon block starting after two days within 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympics, you will be able to enjoy the quiet, pleasant moments that you will most likely look at through the other files.
And if it's the only way that men will be the subject of favorite views and entertainment - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested - Logan Dooley is just waiting for their new fans who are hungry.
"Protesting generation" in Ethiopia, long-term USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Democrats calling for political changes in Ethiopia have resulted in violent opposition from the government.
The Witnesses claim that many protesters were shot during the police attacks.
A war in Ethiopia?
In recent decades it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
During the last few months, however, the country has been plagued by anti-government tensions that spread to more and more areas.
Only in the past week have thousands of people gone to the streets who require fundamental political changes.
According to human rights fighting organizations, government reactions were cruel.
The witnesses claim that the police have shot and killed the representatives of unarmed protesters.
In colloquial video games from protests that are likely to come from the end of the past year or beginning of this year, security officials, such as young adults and adults, are arrested after they have been handed over to the walls in their hands.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even more difficult," Rashid Abdi, leading the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most powerful nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and reporting services cooperate with Ethiopia to remove the danger of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and a small country from Africa, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed at a slow pace.
Her infrastructure has improved in a major way - in the capital of Addis Ababa, even a new local train.
And the streets of cities are typically quiet, safe and clean.
All of Ethiopia may find it difficult to identify as a model of democracy - a human rights organization that talks about government repressions - opposition in the country has been brought to an end, dissidents have been effectively shut down.
Many of them were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed or fled far into the wilderness.
But that can change.
"If you're breathing people and they have no choice but to protest, they're going to break up," said Seyoum Teshome, who talks to the university in central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all young people.
He's protesting the whole generation.
The difficulties are many and relate to all of the disputes about the ground after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
Following the London elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies received the last round of opposition and now controls 100 per cent in parliament.
A growing pressure on the border with Eritrea. The conflict under this unmarked, opposing border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Annylits fear that the separatist groups that have been subjected during the past few years, such as the Russian Liberation Front or the Ugandan National Liberation Front, may try to use and rearm.
There are a number of factors that explain why, after years of flooding under the surface, these bitter feelings have been rebounded.
The first of them seems harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to a few years when they have become more easily accessible by telephone and have improved the provision of Internet services.
And even if the government restricts access to Facebook or Twitter, as is often the case during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxys that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they met in protest.
There is still more solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Armenians and the Amhars are not natural allies.
After a long time, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian heights of Ethiopia, emerged in politics and trade and used the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But it's also changing.
"We are on our way to a united leadership," said Mulat Gemechu, leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests came in the areas of Amhary and Orom.
Many Amhars and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigris ethnic group, which creates around 6 per cent of the population and governs army, reporting services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the trouble is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Finally, the former leader of the rebels was the Ethiopian president of the government for 17 years until his death in 2012 when he suffered an unexpected defeat.
He was considered to be a tactical genius, a man who could see a red one.
Analysts say that in particular, he managed to remove the initial signs of discomfort and use the envoys to work and get on his side.
"The current regime provides basic knowledge," Abdi said, an analysis of the conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was expelled from the relatively unknown to reward Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the northern part of northern Ethiopia, Hailmaria comes from south.
Analytics claim that there is no confidence in the security services of the Tigris.
Many fear that the result will result in further bleeding.
Ethiopia’s last experience was that in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what the analysts described as the will that the government had taken and then stole.
He followed a strong approach during which many protestors were killed - even though less than in the past months - and this period of trouble has passed relatively quickly.
The Committees for Development assessed Ethiopia's leaders for vision infrastructure planning, which is a new local train and moderate progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite obvious that the progressive rise in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped.
And it's going to be a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month protesting in the city of Gondar attacked the business companies of their own Tigers and the fight against tigers on social networks continued to be more common.
Analysts say the protests are leading to an unacceptable situation in the United States and other Western alliances.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a basis for the transfer of drones over neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently declared that the foundation was closed.
While the West wants to support democracy individually, at the same time, it does not want its connections to collapse in such an unprecedented area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp food sharp."
Donald Trump explains his product on Obama and financing IS as "sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to recapitalise the latest controversy, which engulfs his campaign, by saying that he did not think it serious when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "supplying" the terrorist group of the Islamic state.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts his presence in an unpleasant situation, which protected him from violent weather and must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
Following this proposal at a meeting in the middle of the night, Trump confirmed the product on Thursday and continued in the discussions that it was not really meant to say that the President and Mr Clinton created the IS.
In his Twitter contribution on Friday morning, Trump announced that he was just a sarcastic.
The contribution was only one day when Trump said in a few conversations that his accusations were serious.
When the conservative resolution moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's note to slow down by recalling that Obama was urging the destruction of IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump tried to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his preference in the preliminary studies is closing.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in Michigan on two economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to this subject.
On Twitter he also warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes and indicated that her speech was boring.
The trup used the defense of the sarcas before.
At the end of July, when he turned his back on criticism when he proposed that the Russians should proceed to the Clinton e-mails, he later explained his note: “I am, of course, sarcastic.”
This approach enables Trump to press the limits of political declarations and to address them as necessary.
"I think it's his method of testing, to what extent some reports respond to his representatives to find out how they respond, and then, according to one or two ways, "he gave an explanation," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that in my statements it's strange and he knows that they're important enough to explain it differently.
Because the results of the preliminary studies in his favor continue to shine, Trump in recent days has allowed even more toy tones, rather than to calm things down for the general volleyball.
A new study by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with great distance from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to Florida.
The trumpet is actually trying to avoid the procrastinations that it says, but often its criticisms are due to the lack of interpretation of its words or misunderstanding of its sense of humor.
But together with the fact that Trump in the final months of the presidential campaign is facing increased attention, Trump's tip points into the unacceptable situation of his awarding position, which must be publicly behind him, even if his notes are already provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former prime minister of New York City, who is one of the most prominent Trump's supporters, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in the CNN discussion.
"I think that what he says is a correct political comment," Giulian said when he was asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic state.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, I was almost unknown, a small organization that was mistakenly called a novelist, and it came because his army from Iraq remained.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton became a minister of foreign affairs, allowed the IS to rebel and failed to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the Pentecostal assembly in Trump and on Twitter, he spread a fire on the media because they changed every word of his word and were busy with him.
He called out to the “deceptive, pathetic ” TV students who try to understand her, and said, “It won’t work! ”
A number of Democrats have apologized to Trump that it is only another evidence that the Presidency is not justified.
Kavarn was taken out of the price market. Now returning to Greenpoint
Café Verb Cafe was destroyed in Williamsburg, where you could only pay for ready, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been given for 15 years.
It was a surprise that she had been kicked out of the house at Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a trade that Verb won in 2014 - sells furniture in the form of dormitories.
The cities were lying like the last loss of the growing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple on Twitter wrote: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is full and from Verb is now a business business."
But if New York's changed, then it's also re-engagement.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened the moon in November in Greenpoint, less than north of the original place.
New Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and have a similar, humble atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the original coffee shop, who is also owned by the executive director of the new site.
In Verb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his clients offered him to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left many things as they were.
Verb still has the same oven supplier and bought the same machine model on espresso.
He even used the light from the old Word again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new too.
He started using new gestures.
In the offer are sandwiches with honey, eggs and cheese and topings, such as coffee and mixed chocolate.
You'll also find a mixture of ice cream here.
The coffee doesn't give you beer anymore, but it offers you pure fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez saw a constant flow of original stamgas.
"The number of original customers from Williamsburg also had to rise for prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those clients, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveiro (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb Cafe.
She even arrived when the coffee was moving to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb stopped, she had to stop drinking coffee for a while.
"I have found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbu," she said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but on the same day, instead of his usual ice coffee, he gave me a soft tea, another newspaper.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been traveling to Verbu since 2003.
It goes before work and always orders the same thing.
"In the fourth and eighth days, as an hour, I will come, and they will prepare my voice for me with all my voice and with my voice," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add a new offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what's normal, but often he lets himself be put on his neck with a slant, eggs and honey.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry that the meat trade took his old place.
It's true that Soap Cherie's owners offered him a special furniture for Verb and use a filter coffee from the coffee.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the coffee.
One of the new customers transferred the offer to the police and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon show up to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other benefits.
Local producers of fruit juices want to get into the oil and sell filtered coffee.
It offers an opportunity to expand the coffee shop into a nearby building.
A lot of customers are enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee stopped, he broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee is opened again, it's like coming home.
"It made me feel that way," he said.
Depressive food from times of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Not long after his arrival at the president’s office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in Oval, working and eating.
President Roosevelt welcomed the 5th-Avenue selected bodies, such as a bird from the yellow catacombs and a mariland jungle.
His menu on this day, however, was more modest: Satanic in the way in the garden of Eden, brown pirogue, and as a desert of light puddles.
"It was the act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message for Americans to eat."
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights owe their gastronomic history.
The last book Andrew Coea "Chop Suey" was about a Chinese kitchen in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a home in the Lower East Side through food.
Their new "A Square Meal" joint work, which is in the middle of the harp, is the events of the American kitchen during the big economic crisis.
They themselves showed the cook’s solidarity and met with the reporter at evening in Eisenberg’s trade with sandwiches, a small glass of buffet in the fourth Flatiron, which has been in operation since the time of the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered a smetan cheese and a sandwich with dried olives, Andrew (57) gave it to the crocana, bromboro cheese, and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbide, which, according to the press, was excellent enough to talk about food during the crisis.
"The caravans were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He was sold as a Burke, Iron and Fascow Carbanade.
They were made from that right and other cheap food that the ingredients kept.
Stop the number of beers that you should eat at dinner.
Andrew Coe broke up.
"They would lie in your stomach like a wolf," he said.
In the years before the crisis, the American kitchen, especially in the rural areas, was given the shape of a buffet dinner you eat.
The women's teams burned for farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner they offered a freshly baked cake.
They were Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" follows how the nation was compared to the fact that it was not a country of refuge at once.
"It was the time when the food became a central, threatened point for American people," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same threat was the new accounting diet: it spreads delicious foods, such as carbanaths and castrools, cassoroles as “a wonderful way to use the rest,” noted Ziegelman, because the cooks could hide non-aesthetic ingredients under the type of cream.
The pure fruit was restored to the gentlest dried fruit.
The mass - after a long year, the average point of American food - became a highly developed luxury.
Similar mixtures that were to serve as calorific and life-threatening supplements were precipitated or even healthy in the burning process.
During the study of a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelmana prepared a meal from a hot chocolate filled with beer butter.
"It wasn't a favorite meal on the table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman pointed out: "It was surreal."
The beer butter with the bread-cubule doesn't go together.
It was typical of a lot of domestic recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economies - including Louise Stanley, the head of the federal government for the domestic economy in the years 1923 - 1943 - led the country’s conservation practices.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over the heavy budget, and candles, such as meditated spaghetti from milk, turned into delicious food.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical honours.
In particular, attempts have been made in response to the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as perhaps after President Herbert Hoover's "I'm going to cook".
While he publicly praised the simple egg farm kitchen of his childhood, he served as a chosen millionaire who became.
"He likes to eat continental cuisines like fish with a urticaria," said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost abandoned room, he had a smudge on him.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor refused to go for example with her own complaint.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt's host, who was not interested in the taste at all, led to the fact that the White House “did not only offer the best food in all Washington, but also in the most unhappy way prepared."
A number of food habits since the crisis have been different from what the country has put on its feet again.
The withdrawal remained in our continued calorie and survival studies, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to heating.
Some say that during the writing of the books they better understood the loving habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't afford food.
"She had real fear of food poisoning," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: “People were wrong. ”
There's been a misunderstanding with the prisoners.
When there were pure chairs in Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe made a dessert that they prepared at home: a Christmas dessert that President Roosevelt ate for dinner.
"It's called the Christmas tree," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes for the elegant name.
There wasn't any cream there, just candles, a little milk, sugar, water and sugar.
Every one of them accidentally locked a lie in a hot stomach.
That was amazingly bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right owner said to his wife, "It would be a little bit of a dry straw."
Europeans: Migrants go for doses.
Most of the refugees who move to Europe come for economic reasons.
The young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's what the series would look like if we were to hit them.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, is playing from their country of origin.
The photoshop creates colleges that are excited about how it would look if the famous series and films were directed in Russia.
Gilead has a guarantee of the cost of legal representation in the case of a patent against type C fraud against the Merck Group
The Court of Justice decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a claim for the payment of fees for lawyers who have made it in the process of patenting the type C schloutence against the manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment was lifted, according to which Gilead had to pay 200 million for damages due to the deterioration of two Merck’s patents in connection with very successful treatments of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after which the federal court found repeated illegal contact with Merck’s side, in addition to another lie under oath and other non-ethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman, in his fourth letter, stated that Gilead has an increase in the minimum of payments that have been made in connection with the submission in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market of new generation medicines against type C schloutence, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The experience comes from 2013 when both Gilead and Merck complained about each other and claimed that they were the owners of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active substance from Gilead.
American military support units claim that they have gained full control of the city of Manbij
The US-supported military units gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last soldiers of the Islamic state from the city entered the fifth language group.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now crossing the city after the remnant of a group of radicals that have been hiding in the city.
The units released over 2,000 civilians who held radical arrests, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish with the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council.
"The city is now under our control, but we're still looking for it," said Agent Reuters.
Clinton paid $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax rate 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton, on Friday, confirmed its tax recognition for 2015, stating that the presidential candidate for democracy and her husband had an income of $10.75 million in that year and had a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton won $1 million on the charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation. Acting President Bill Clinton contributed a total of almost $5.3 million to the common fund of the prize, and the former Foreign Minister admitted an admission of $3 million from Simon & Schuster's charging book on his foreign ministry.
Clinton's collective candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife, Anne Holton, confirmed the tax recognition for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding for false statements and claiming from his previous promises that his tax recognition is credible.
It is customary for candidates to grant their tax recognition to the President of the United States, even though they are not subject to the law.
Trump, a merchant from New York, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. Tax Committee as a reason for his refusal to accept the tax.
"Your move," said campaigner Hillary Clinton on Twitter and pointed to the tax recognition of democratic candidates.
Michael Cohen, Special Counsel of Trump, said on Thursday CNN that it would not allow Trump's tax recognition to be confirmed until audits have been completed.
According to Trump's critics, among them the Republican candidate for the 2012 President Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, it is agreed that his refusal raises questions regarding his net profit, contributions to the Charter, trade and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is strongly involved in the issue and has published on Friday a video that reminds us of the high rates of the Republic of Trupa to confirm its tax recognition.
The fourth question is mentioned in its report on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates did to the Presidency after the decade - to confirm his tax recognition," the people said.
The Political Organization indicated that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times publisher quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim that this can be done at the same time.
The federal tax rates have become the subject of presidential elections.
Clinton passes a rule named after billionaire Warren Buftt, which would ensure that all who make up more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week Buffet at the Clinton Assembly in Omaze, in Nebraska, where Buffet Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, invited Trumpa to meet and exchange tax recognitions.
Buffett said he was also audited by the IRS and that Trump was "not afraid" by the financial authority, but by the voters.
Clinton's campaign confirmed the tax recognition by the end of 2007.
Clinton, who is now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid federal tax in 2007 to 2014 at an average of 32 per cent and a combined tax at about 40.5 per cent.
From the 2015 Clinton tax recognition, it appears that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton was granted a grant to dividends and interest in excess of $109,000.

Condoms filled with Chile or a fire extinguisher for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use a nonorthodox method to prevent elephants from being preyed to human beings - hair on them condoms filled with chili powder.
This process was witnessed by Honeyguide, who, with the idea that a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and teaches volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, such as by means of this cruel procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops, without harming animals.
Many of them used copies to defend themselves.
The fifth is the world day of elephants, which is dedicated to protecting these animals.
"Since the time this ... tool file has been created, we have recorded changes in behavior in these communities. People believe more and more that it can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell award in a statement.
The first and second steps are on the passing floor to greet the battery and to drop the clown.
If she doesn't do this, she's gonna have to wear a so-called chilli suit.
Chilli's smile-sucking bums together with the petar dolls in the condom, his end depends so he can just hang out with it.
After burning, the condom will explode and the air will be sprayed with chilli.
Most of them have one fun and the elephant comes out another way.
The last option is a fire extinguisher that generates a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director stopped at the Berlin hotel because he removed the code for calling to Israel for "request" Arabs - RT News
The French film director of the Jewish origin launched solutions in the media after discovering that the Campinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to an employee's word on the basis of the "request" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary "Shoah" holocaust, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of hotel calls codes.
The state has not been established between countries where it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, Germany’s capital, Israel was removed and destroyed?
Nassal Lanzmann.
Hotel Campinski Bristol instead offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and had a problem with the hotel reception.
The answer that Lanzmanna received, according to his word, was "screaming."
The hotel worker replied that the measure was "resolved after considering the management of the company Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this step of the director was even more widespread.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and asked you to remove the voice code of Israel," the Lanzmann staff quoted in their letters.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's spokesman in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman described the case as "a great loss".
We were scared and shocked by the events.
It's just about yourself. It's a huge shame.
The fact that such a thing happened in Germany and more in such a hotel chain is even greater than it was.
No further explanation is required.
We expect the hotel to produce the correct conclusion," he said.
The event triggered a strong online reaction, people marked it as scandalous.
Some believe that the hotel Campinski simply "lost" in demanding Arab customers.
"Hanba for you," says another contribution, indicating that the hotel located in the noble street of Kurfurstendam is located near the synagogue.
According to the Diary Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any charges of having the incident marked "translution" and "recorded" to Lanzman.
"No direct order has ever been issued" does not include Israel in the list of codes for calling, says Suddeutsche Zeitung, representative of the Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
The police used heavy gas and rubber projects against Brazilian students
The students and the police arrived in the Brazilian San Paul on Thursday when the students met for demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The anti-prosperity police used heavy gas and rubber projects.
The problem was solved when the government executives tried to separate the students, which resulted in the use of rubber design and solid gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration with a view to expressing their concerns about their plans.
Among the proposals of the government of San Paulo Geralda Alckmina to save money is the closure of almost a hundred public schools and the transfer of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see how they accepted letters against former President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protests will only come a few days after the demonstrators appeared together on the street in support of President Dilmy Rousseff's seat when the Senate decided on her apology.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian declaration in Iran, Lebanon Dzhagaryana grew after the reduction of the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran in the mid-year comparison of 70.9%.
As the rapporteur pointed out, from the time the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest was increased by Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is of course one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in comparison with the same period in 2015 and reached over $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose by 91.5 per cent and reached over $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The economic growth of trade has ensured the supply of equipment, land vehicles and weapons," said the speaker.
Dhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Over the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued some 35,000 visas, mainly travel to Iran.
Iran first reached between top 20 countries according to the number of tourists who come to Russia.
It can certainly be said that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be confirmed in the last year," he said.
At the same time, Iran visits a relatively small number of Russians.
"I personally can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner runs home after the British got gold in cyclists
Callum Skinner from Scotland came in last night to the shadow of glory at the male team's latrine in Rio, when three VB teams had held a title from London 2012.
The 32-year-old cousin of Glasgow was in the role of a speed that he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend was happy when he joined the goal and stole the victory from the favored New Zealand.
The British won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was packed after the end of the humble sixth world champion in the road cycle in the summer, even though Hoy finished his career.
The problem between Peking and London was the reward for a specialized initial runner, Jamie Staff.
So Hindus appeared right on time.
After Hoye left, there was also a place where he tried to fill out Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential was now confirmed.
Kenny Hindus - who was with Hoy's champion four years ago - and Skinner got an Olympic record at the qualification, but the trick took the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got in the team's golden ring.
Indes was behind his bike, but Kenny attacked the team in front and Skinner held the lead.
The change of the strategy was a large part of the transformation when Hindus went to higher translation to slow down and enable Kenny and, in part, Skinner to maintain the pace.
Hoy was watching from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny, and Hindus appeared on the floor, he didn't put his eyes on them.
Three-year-old Skinner, father of Glasgow, said: “It's a lichotic comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of me and to honor my name.
We've created an Olympic record in the finals and we've missed the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After triumfu with Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012 Hindus admitted that he fell on the street voluntarily after a weak start.
The signal came back later, and the British opponents had no chance to call back.
This time there was no such problem around this victory.
He said, "With all those British trains at the courts, I became like London."
In the last three months, we've all been a team.
We've played in many of the world's sports, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If it should be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we've been waiting for five days on the planet.
With the form Kenny suggested, it's not impossible to pack Hoy's success and win on one Olympic three gold medals at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has been born on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, this day also celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - marked all six gold medals and one silver medal.
Just as much as Hoy got.
As the next one, Kenny's going to take part in a party that starts today and lasts for another three days.
An eight - year - old father from Bolton said: “I don’t enjoy it here.
Team race is always the best.
You're playing with the others.
To tell the truth, to win for myself is a little lonely.
He said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should have a guitar title."
It was the only medal competition that day, but the British were waiting for another good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doll qualified as the fastest in the four-mile racing race.
It ended with 3:51.943.
World record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the finals (22:42) take place on today's second day of the race on which Wiggins is intended.
He discussed with the Commissioner yesterday before the qualifying court, when its decision-makers called for a high-level measurement.
In a similar race, women who continue and end tomorrow reached Laura Trottov, Joanna Rowsell Shandov, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavia's world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its heavy driving cycle team and ruled the middle of the Olympic Games and received a lot of medals.
In fact, exceptional performances, which show the widespread movement in Beijing and London, were reduced during the preparation for Rio.
On the back were dramatic events, in the final order of the technical director Shane Sutton in the depth due to charges of sex and discrimination, and the end of the career of adults, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as indicated by the first night of the competitions on the planet, the legendary reputation of the Great Britain team seems to be able to give a spectacular performance with perfect timing so that it can be confirmed again.
Uncertainty of the future in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland branch office in Victoria - and the workplaces of the hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the electricity supplied by the company and who informed of the intention of one of the owners of the branch of the electricity supply contract to end. It is expected that all contracts for supply of electricity will be concluded.
This step is followed by what the Government of Victoria decided earlier this year that it would not sell the supply of supplies that the company holds in circulation.
The payment of a fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in danger of up to 2000 jobs.
In closing, up to 2000 jobs can be threatened - directly or indirectly.
And because it consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it can lead to other side effects.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the bridge of Point Henry, which led to the closure of England's electricity.
Alcoa's tavira company in Portland is spreading and threatening to close it.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, mainly in response to a strong Australian dollar and in recent times because of the prices for the production of the train.
AGL, which delivers a large ceiling to the electrician Loy Yang A at Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that some of the other three owners will also decide to conclude the contract.
The majority of the company's owners are Alcoa and Alumina, a small business unit holding the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubine Corp.
"AGL expects that the Portuguese competition will continue to function, in other words, so that the demand for electricity from the border will continue," she said.
AGL indicated that the contracts were so-called ‘assurance contracts’ that they should enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have 12 months of notice, so their payment will actually end in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be divided into profits for the fiscal year 2017," the electrician said.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits since the fiscal year 2018 is still limited due to the strong view of the comedian market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL indicated that it had already signed the value of the contract according to its accounts in excess of $187 million "in case it would have reached its end."
Alcoa noted that the decision to conclude the contract “has no impact on its ... ability to carry out a tavern or to secure the supply of electricity to the tavern.”
The U.S. company stated that in 2010, it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang that had to start paying since November this year, even though it still had to explain why the contract was concluded.
The analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portuguese tavern in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts this week, said Portland annually consumes about 600 megabytes of electricity and about 900 megabytes of Tomago.
If both of these undertakings were marketed, it would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not the only star real TV show Kardashian - now is the observatory of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and fourth mother-man of Klan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the American newspaper Vogue.
Kendall, Ambassador of the Eeste Lauder, who presided at the fashion week in Milan, Paris, and New York, announced the news on Thursday at his Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry on this title page," Kendall wrote.
The removal of the title page was strange (or simply continuation of humor in Kardashian giving?) a video that included the entire Kardashian-General family (including Rob and Caitly's fans and with them all the favorite actress from the showhouse, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sisters, they forgot that the scene could end with a classic turn: they are preparing a secret party.
It is a protected action line of almost every "natural" part of the child television show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we forgot about You?" with the integrity of the queen dressed in order at eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to make sure that the other girls could live on this publication.
Because when we look at the number of Vogue magazines, we're definitely entering the new era of Cardassian.
Her older sister Kim Kendall may have been attacked by Vogue on the side (she was on her side with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the magazine’s release was different.
The first edition of the Vogue magazine is the most produced year-round number.
The issue, which reminds his press of a book for advertising purposes more than the fashion magazine, includes a series of inzers (Fashionist calculated that 615 pages were from 832 pages in the lower edition).
The discovery of the stars appearing on the title page is unexpected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years, the photographs of the magazine have disappeared before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared in the past were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist or Kate Moss.
Over the past few years, the title page has certainly seen more "cellulars making models" than "models that are celebrates."
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscara holder and Dior's ambassador, appeared on the title in 2013, and a year later, Lagy Gaga was honored.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - whose store describes her generation as a "sex model" - falls into the first category, will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not popular people, neither the stars of real shows, nor children today who know how to do a well-founded video (even if Jenner represents all of this).
They're apparently talented women who come out of the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page, had one of the most violent years in her career thanks to the release of Lemonade Alba.
Of course not everyone's success is overemphasized.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original model Victoria's Secret criticised Jenner and her colleague Gig Hadid in June and called her "girls of the moment".
These feelings were rebounded by the report that Jenner appeared on Vogue's observatory.
But this discomfort isn't on the spot.
Kendall Jenner's on the sidewalk of the Starfleet Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's in charge of Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up from the East Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own toilets.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures of the LOVE store.
And in free moments it works in reality show, maybe just as one of the ways to see Kurtney and her children.
Community Centre for Legal Aid Annually disbanded 160 000 people
More than 160 000 of the most threatened citizens are denied legal aid every year in the Community centres and are in the sector itself affected by the consequences that will result in further restrictions on financial resources for the services already carried out.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly people of advanced age, immigrants, threats of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means to fight injustice and similarly - are being dismissed at a time when they are looking for free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so engaged to the pollutant, are subject to further scrutiny.
Since June next year, this legal aid centre will come up with another 30 per cent federal funding.
The director of the Community Centre for Legal Aid in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the most recent comprehensive reports of the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, it was found that five thousand people were rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without a decision of the federal government, the situation would be worse.
"The Community legal aid centre in Queensland is chronically funded, which means that thousands of people are denied vital services that they need," he said.
People who have avoided relationships with violence, people with excessive and protective debt, families with decision-making, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not have the opportunity to get the help they need.
The Federal Government has reduced funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, leading to the fact that thousands of other people threatened in Queensland will have to focus on complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the national representative and Senator Queensland George Brandise to prevent this financial decline immediately so that people can get the help they need when they get to legal problems.
In recent years, the government has been committed to ensuring legal aid to the highest international level.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal aid centres and their clients' communities and the Palaškov government must invest in this important work.
Request for Donalda Trumpa campaign after the member of the state has deliberately intended the weapon
New York: The Donalda Trumpa campaign was filed for allegedly ineffectiveness after they were informed that the Operation Director in North Carolina intended a weapon for a member of the state during the trip.
The incident was recorded in a court letter, which, in the middle of the court of Charlotte, handed over to Vincent Boroni, a former law school student in the state.
Bordoni said that the month was waiting for the situation to be resolved inside before he reached the conclusion that "it will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "signed the fingerprints, gave the right clue to the bag and put Vincent's head in the pocket," Bordoni added in his complaint.
According to the letter, after the difficulty in the local and regional leadership campaign, Boroni found that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"The weapons do not have to be shot to cause damage," Boroni complained.
The appeal will only come two days after the Republican candidate to the president called for an appeal, when the voters in North Carolina said they would be able to interrupt the owners and holders of the weapons (which is regulated in the second appendix of the Constitution) if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and was able to appoint his judge.
The trumpet campaign says that the media broke his words from the context and that Trump did not resist violence.
Boroni in the complaint calls for the campaign of revenge for weekly supervision and from Phillip for the threat of personal security, illegal use of violence and the use of emotional interests.
The trumpeter's speaker, Hope Hicks, was not responding immediately to the request for a comment.
Trying to get an expression from Phillip was unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news station in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had just left the campaign.
The phone to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not responded in a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is leading a controversial campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and for London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is an enormously attractive way, just like London 2012 when we have developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to endure from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games marked large profits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we create 10,000 new educational sites, 40,000 new jobs, and we end up with the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just like before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be dozens of people who will think that Heathrow's expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for Olympics and that we would laugh at the world floor.
The suspects were mistaken in 2012 and in Heathrow's case, they were not right.
Heathrow will always have to overcome obstacles, but heathrow will be able to answer every question that concerns him.
Like Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project that involves many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave the legacy in terms of skill and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team on Heathrow, who set up an investment programme in infrastructure for 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal - which was selected as the best terminal in the world for five years, after the T2 terminal, which was built between two of the most terrible branches in the world.
They are now ready to add the third round, which represents 16 billion free of private investment.
Games in London in 2012 were a great success in Britain, and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion will be theirs too.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of Olympic heroes and extend Heathrow, ensure trade in the future and leave the legacy of skill and employment that the British may be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the President of the Presidency and former Deputy Minister for Trade Affairs of the Finance Ministry.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in game on cat and mouse in blocking advertising
Of the attempts to cover the programs blocking advertising, for companies that make online marketing, there was a game on the cat and mouse. At least it is claimed by one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus confirmed the contribution in which users can update filters in their program and reblock advertising on this social network.
Facebook in the afternoon indicated that its desktop pages change the encoding around the advertising to make it more difficult to find out which parts of the pages are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes are already in circulation.
Speaker Adblock Ben Williams wrote in his blog that "this is a sort of war between the open source of advertising and those who are trying to cover it, it has been since the blocking of advertising has been found," and that Facebook is likely to come with other own equipment.
The fact that the company has entered the world's largest social network in the war only proves how much trouble the blocking of advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe spent around 200 million advertising worldwide - almost four months before it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now achieves 84% of the profits from Facebook ads, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1,03 billion active users.
The speaker pointed out that the company is going against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile filters do not work on mobile applications for social networks and Instagram.
Advertising on the desktop is still so high that Facebook has decided to invest in it.
Facebook also announced in the afternoon that it will update the tool for "ad preferences" to allow people to better control how the ads appear to them.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that the new Adblock filters are worrying because on the pages they could also block content that does not match the advertising.
"It's not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," said Mr Facebouk in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an unfeeling tool, and that's why we'd rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman hit the car in Switzerland.
The victim was lying on the street in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses of events where on Thursday mornings several cars were on the street of a woman who was probably trying to escape suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in canton Vaud shortly after midnight in Thursday.
The Vaud police indicated in the statement that the "independable act" actor was in the dark on the road and passed several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill and hit several cars, including a cost vehicle.
She died on the spot.
A number of drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, not all are yet identified, and the police call these drivers and all the others who were not witnesses to sign up.
There was an open criminal investigation, a "logical" step in the situation like this, said for Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to find out whether any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to prevent this?
This must be found by the complainant," said Hofstetter.
On the basis of two similar cases in the past five years, it appears that the drivers will not be responsible.
In both cases - one of which dealt with a person coming in the distance - it was decided that the motorists could not expect the walkers who spend the night passing the distance as the news indicated.
Last year, a police officer was released for murder after being beaten and killed on the night of August 2014 by a man lying on the A1 street near Payinnen.
The court ruled that the victim had been drinking alcohol at 22 years of age and was on a train.
The court found that the police officers - who responded to the urgent call - ate properly and that the presence of a man on the road was "all exceptional and unpredictable," the judge said.
Any person with information on the fourth incident that occurred in Morges should report to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a favorite destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) is expected to reach up to 20,000 visitors within Prague Pride to Prague.
On Friday, the Executive Director of the AČCKA Caterín Petříčková sent it.
The sixth anniversary of Prague Prade started on 8 August, the festival draws closer to the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Loni participated in the campaign about 35 thousand people.
"Praha belongs among the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, which is for the high degree of tolerance and the wide range of specialised businesses," said Petříčková.
According to the editors, foreign visitors lose the festival at an average of 3100 per person per day.
Gay tourists are supporting their travel to the special map of Prague with a complete list of Prague gays and gay friends bars, clubs, coffee and restaurants like mobile applications, etc.
"For travel travel it is generally paid that LGBT customer is very lucrative, interested in staying in higher prices with a high standard of travel services and losing more than others," said Petříčka.
As part of the annual festival program, the first Pride Tourism Symposium was run.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT road transport sector from Europe, the United States and China.
The festival continues on Sunday 14 August.
The main theme of this year is love, but action will also be fought against a number of thematic areas that are family, AIDS prevention and transgender problems.
The festival will be held on Saturday with allegorical vehicles coming from the Václavs' town in Latvia.
The reason that thousands of people have participated in the past years is that this year the memory of the victims of a red attack in the night club in Orland, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrate for four decades.
The inordinarily complex Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end up in disaster, has been enjoying small and great wonders for four decades.
The pilot part of this evening series of director Lubomíra Benesche had a prime minister on 12 August 1976.
As a result of this animated series, which now knows more than a hundred stars in more than a hundred countries of the world, the impressions of the designer and director of Lubomíra Benesche, who was discussing the magazine with two bags of Mr. Ouholiček and Sedlek.
Benez later joined the dramatour of Jiří Kubička and the designer Vladimir Jiránka and produced the film Kučáci together.
Today’s fashion with the yellow and red triangle and the bullet and radio show came in 1979, when in the short film Prague started to feature a series for Slovenian television.
The names Pat and Mat were obtained in 1985, this time for the Prague short film.
In 1990, Lubomír Benez founded his own studio of an animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Curych, where other works took place.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other artists, many of whom were shared by Benesh son of Marek.
There are currently more than ninety episodes of the stories of these cats that all sleep under their hands, but they never hurt themselves and are always full of optimism, ideas, and cults, and finally they are satisfied with their work, which is part of the known gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters or other toys with the appearance of Pat and Mat are in every game.
It's for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmonics.
At the end of the week is in the mark of the event, we have chosen for you one sports and one of life.
They both have a good end.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and he's happy with her.
And for what things do people lose most on planes?
It's a five-way review from the world's websites.
The first medals from the Olympic Games.
Historic success celebrates Fiji's island state.
Ragby’s choice of this island was made in the finals of the Olympic tournament of the British team’s seven-week band.
It's just the first medal that Fiji won for herself on the Olympics.
Waiting for the win of the first prize cup lasted for sixty years from sending the first training to the Olympic Games.
There's a great deal of success for coach Fiji.
It's ironic, however, that they have Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been taking place since 2013 and after the end of the British population, it has been able to be at peace with its countries.
"Let's go play freely and easy and see if we can manage the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the final.
Fiji finally ruled over it and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants now live in the Olympic Games.
He brought the report to the French Colonel Le Monde.
New friend and lucky for a little girl.
2 year Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living with no hands and feet for 11 months.
A lady who looks like her.
"Mummy, she's like me," the two-year-old girl was glad to see her mother made up for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes panence to her hands and feet and then she sits together without a fight.
Harmonics have been diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than a year of life, and doctors have given her only 10 percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't like about her.
It's beautiful, smart, funny, and it's never going to happen.
He's got a look.
I saw her represent the other kids with the words "Ahi, I'm Harmonie, and I don't have my hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the lady.
What are we going to lose at the airport for?
CNN provides a finding that people on the airports are most likely to lose their bathing water.
The sales director Hudson's travel essential store published data in the last year, where he collects 10 products that customers in his airport store buy most.
Water was mostly first.
The drinks were generally very popular, in the first decade they were placed eight.
The 9th place contained a large m&M balloon with a coconut juice.
And you can figure out who's closing the first tenth?
As one of the above things you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular news sold on airports includes: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch a The Economist.
The universe's superhero.
We're just gonna win, they're laughing at Murray and Bond.
Rectors Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand are sovereignly ruling two categories without the Corridor for seven years and their dominants have also confirmed the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the two of them moved to a smaller post-Olympia camp in Beijing and from 2009 onwards in competition.
At Rodrigo de Freitas, 69th prizes were awarded in the fourth final.
What are we different from the others?
We're just pretty, Murray's already tweeted through the Olympic Reggat when he had to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we're not doing anything different about the others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're still trying to improve our technology, it's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their rule is remarkable and because they're physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-metre and stochial chassis, academic view of Bond is less than five inches [5 cm] and less than 15 kilograms [15 kilograms].
They also have a different attitude.
Bond's studying and paying with finance, Murray's got, for example, a charity boxer game.
And that's why it's not too much time to celebrate together.
Eric's heading into the boat, basically because we can't win.
We're just gonna win.
I have a tendency to think about what can be seen, Bond acknowledged, who at the press conference took note of Murray's dominant position.
He just always answered as the first and Bond waited for his chance.
But there's nothing against the calm force on the water.
They eat their pace, and often in half of the traffic are not in their head, their gradual acceleration has not yet been achieved by opponents.
We're running two kilometers and we never wanted to go the first mile away.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
We know what we need to do to win, said four-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he got seven gold medals on the world's mysteries.
In 2007, the two members of the gold rings were also triumphed.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger Olympics in Beijing a year later, they decided to move to a couple of nostalgias.
At the Olympics in London, the biggest obstacle was to open their careers and the dominants were confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be very hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well on it, Murray brought it in.
We know we all want to get out of the tower.
We still have this field on the back.
But we're trying to be half a step in front of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venezuela was once a citizen
According to NASA's new climate model project, Venus was sometimes civilized.
Scientists at the NASA Institute for Space Studies developed a model for studying Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by scientists living in climate studies.
The model was designed to determine whether ever in Venice, whose surface is hot, without water and CO2 measured, conditions could be met under similar conditions on Earth.
Scientists have already suggested that the low speed of the Venus can explain its harsh atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus was ever able to penetrate the atmosphere like the Earth and then to turn away slowly.
The model was also used by the previous Venusian topography.
There may have been more areas on the planet than on Earth, but at times there was enough water and soil diversity to rule over life and provide protection against rapid depletion.
Venoša also used the sun, which was 30 percent thicker.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during a short journey, he presents his daily page to the sun almost two months at a time," explained a GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This leads to the heating of the surface and the shape of the shower, which creates a mass of clouds that behave as a shower and the surface protects against too much solar heat.
The result is an average temperature that is actually lower than at the present time on Earth.
The model made the story of Venus a similar evolution, which was once hypothetically composed by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus was probably inhabited in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultrasound burning.
Her oceans disappeared, and the water pairs were burned with ultraviolet light.
The water disappeared and became just a hot atmosphere of oxygen mixed with the deadly effects of the greenhouse gas -- it's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers confirmed their results from the new Venus climate model in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy refused to post a team coach Colorado Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy rejected his position as a coach and vice president of the hockey operations team Colorado Avalanche, as a reason he had the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process in the team.
The executive vice president/general manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed step by step and announced that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I've been acting as the main coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, yours and your decisions," said decades-old Roy in a statement.
For a long and intense years, I thought about how I could improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the views of the coach and vice-president of hockey operations be consistent with the views of the organization.
It must also be possible to participate in decisions affecting the team's performance.
These conditions are not met at present.
Sakic, who received Roye on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and take him into the future with great happiness.
Roy was nominated to the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to the score of 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, met with Minnesota in the first round of play-off, and during the last two years, he did not always go out after the season.
The Avalanche team in the season 2015/2016 reached score 39:39:4 and missed five points to get another wild map in the Western Conference.
The banker Roy, who wrote his name to China, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Workers on the coast in the North Sea resume conversations and break the strike
The Czech representatives of the same party indicated that the stocks for workers on the North Sea had been suspended, while all parties of the dispute had come to a new round of settlement.
To stand against the company's services for the mining field Wood Group liaisely arrived on the plains of the North Sea, which runs the Royal Dutch Shell company.
"Wood Group and the United Nations and RMT committee organisations can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current imbalances," the statement states.
Starting next week, we will have several weeks of full-day meetings, where we will try to look at new tasks.
According to committee organizations, their recent actions, which were first in their terms for more than 25 years, were protested against fraud by up to 30 per cent.
In the year, the Wood Group reduced prices and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 per cent less due to negative market pressure.
The decrease in company rates is due to a reduction of 10% for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further damages would provide space to deal with market distortions.
On the other hand, Shell opened out of his payrolls thousands of people and announced plans to release operations on the ground floor and ground floor to 10 countries for modernising his processes - directly after mega fuze with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low prices of oil, the economic situation associated with the UK's red decision to leave the European Union.
Member of the Parliament of Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with the committee leaders this week to address one of the largest labour shortages of the whole generation that led to the summit in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he indicated, is vital for the economy in the region of life.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some," he said.
For comparison, approximately $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea in 2016, while the average over the last five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler is measuring the speed of turning stars in Plyjadach
The most recent mission of Kepler's space telescope to assist astronomers is to get almost a complete list of speeding stars from the Plejad's constellation.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the constellation point at different speeds, as well as how the rotation time relates to the formation of the planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between star weight, age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebulov, research worker at the center of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Stargate is 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the cave now reach the state of maturity and have emerged for about 125 million years.
Now it's moving faster.
In the moment of maximum speed, these moving stars release huge amounts of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a negative effect on them.
Along with the way the star grows, its speed decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the appearance of different points on the stars -- similar sunscreens.
According to the latest data on speeds, stars are smaller than mass stars.
Rebull's star compares to dancers, making pirates smaller than those smaller.
"In "Balette" We see that smaller point stars are more massive, while those that point faster are usually very light stars," Rebulov said.
Because stars are so close, they serve as the ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the star and speed of rotation.
"The consequences give us a box for theoretical models of star rotation to both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebulov said.
There is still much to be learned about when and why stars reduce their speed of turning and thus say “the weight of their dance boots on the refrigerator”.
Rebulvan and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the rapid impact of the Flood in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualifying agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after a study without being enrolled in a specialized education?
I am concerned that in the area where I would like to work, there is now a free place of work only in some distant hospital, but in half of a year, the grave could be set free in another place where I would then like to work.
So, I don't know how to deal with the situation that he's in half, he's still asking.
He's responding to Mr. Lenka Vlkov's response.
No legal provision shall lay down the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with employees - hospitals.
The qualification agreement is a legal institution which manages the labour law and may be concluded between the employee and the employee in order to ensure the return of the costs incurred by the increase or the extension of the qualifications of the employee.
In the area of health, a long-term pressure on non-conformity of these agreements with the aim of ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals and not all hospitals at the same time require this agreement.
Under Law No 95/2004, concerning the conditions for obtaining and recognition of professional skills and specialized skills for performing the medical call of a doctor, a dentist and a pharmacist, it expressly states that participation in specialized education is considered to be an improvement of qualifications (never for her further education).
This means that a qualifying agreement may be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least 75 000 Kč.
There is no legal requirement or obligation to participate in specialized education.
The law only lays down conditions for the application for admission to the specialized education area.
However, the doctor is entitled to carry out a doctor's invitation by completing the necessary high school study, even if it is subject to the conditions laid down by the law (under the professional supervision of the doctor with specialized competences in the relevant area).
The Law provides for situations where a professional practice in other areas of specialisation may be carried out in the specialized education of a doctor if its contents and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to start a period of processing elsewhere, which would correspond to a desperate situation.
However, given that I do not know more about this case, it may be recommended to consult the relevant Committee of the Ministry of Health (Scientific and Medical Appeals Committee) as the Ministry of Health provides advice and advisory services related to the appointment of specialized education and through it.
The Advisory Service also provides the Czech medical room with free of charge, where each doctor must be a member of it.
Doctors from the Syrian Halabu are asking for US intervention.
The United States did not make any efforts to end the decomposition (resurrection of the city by government forces), and did not exercise its influence on the protection of civilians, citing the letter addressed to the White House of the AFP Agency.
"We don't need tears, feelings, and even prayers; however, we hope to create an east Halab without an annual zone to stop attacks, and we need an international action that will ensure that Halab will not be re-arranged," the doctors said.
Russian forces supporting the army to the faithful President of Bashar Asad announced that he will stop every day for three hours in the Halab area in order to enable the safe passage of humanitarian forces.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELK should be stopped all military activities, air raids and firefights.
The Head of the UN Humanitarian Operations, Stephen O'Brien, welcomed it, but stressed that there is a need for at least two-day directness.
According to the AFP in the letter, 15 of 35 doctors who are active in the eastern part of Halab have already controlled the rebels.
It says that during the fifth war, witnesses were violent, cruel deaths of innocent patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world looks and sees how complicated Syria is, but it's only doing a little to protect us.
Recent evacation offers from the Syrian regime and Russia seem to be only a small-scale outbreaks, plague of pediatrics, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors indicated that 42 attacks were reported in Syria during the past month, from 15 in the hospital where they work.
We are most sad that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Young children come to us with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them the ones most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material needed to help them sign doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were awakened when the blast stopped supply of oxygen to their incubators.
And they fell down upon their necks, and then their life came to an end, before they could actually begin to remember.
The army of faithful President Bashar Asad, who supports the Russian forces, in the past few weeks, called for an invasion of the ruling eastern part of Halab, in which there was no food supply of over 200,000 people.
Rebels, who are under constant pressure from the Russian and Syrian airports, were subjected to prolomitic surgery and prothiofensin on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides came to the city and its surrounding forces.
