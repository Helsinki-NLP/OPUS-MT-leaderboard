Members of the Welsh Parliament do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as the Am (Assembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is based on the plans to amend the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of the whole political spectrum are afraid that this could lead to late-life.
A representative from the Labour Party Labour explained his group was concerned because "it mentions Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means "duste", and pwp means "besj".
A representative of the Wales Party of Plaid Cymru said that the group in its entirety was “missing” and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Walisian part of the conservative party said his group was ‘open’ for the change of name, but noted that the MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some well-known figures, is also a British slogan for ‘dusty’.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is expressed in a similar way as the letter U is expressed in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a ‘uh’ sound.
The Assembly of the Commission, which currently develops laws to introduce the name change, said: ‘Of course, it is the members themselves who have the last right to determine what name they shall refer to.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh National Assembly permission to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation, which showed general support for the rebaptisation of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives, the WMPs (Wellsh Parliament Members) were supported, but the MWP option was most supported during the public hearing.
The representatives propose other alternatives, but to get all parties to reach agreement may lead to the presidency of Parliament, Elin Jones, which, in accordance with the plan, will provide a legislative draft for the change in name within the next few weeks.
The legislation on reform will include other changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last right to vote on what they will be called when they discuss the work of law.
Macedonians go to the elections to determine whether the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people's vote is held in an attempt to resolve a several ten-year dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region on behalf of Macedonia.
The Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour is a requirement in their territory, and for several reasons it has rejected the country's requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjerge Ivanov, an opposition to the referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Minister of State Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in name is simply the price they have to pay in order to participate in the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's style – the circles in Harlem Sliter
"The old ones I spoke to have told me that before that time there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adam said.
‘Now none of the parts are present.’
He said that the loss of the bar was understandable.
“People are socially around each other in other ways” now to date, he says.
«Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which all visit regularly.»
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not be as long as the leaders think. "And before or after they are back at the beginning."
The churches, which he adds, can be replaced by apartment building completely by the type of people who do not want to help the rest of the neighborhood.
‘The majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,’ he said, ‘and therefore will only hasten the day when these churches have to close the doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these facilities will become members of these churches.’
Both circles were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white methodistic ratio moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had remained close to the building survived.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under John Howard Johnson, who led a shop of 125th Street dealers – one of Harlem's main dealers – because they are absolutely able to hire or encourage black workers.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, and when Johnson’s son - in - law laid plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillonet was “the church bells of the poor people”.
The expert who played the carillonet in July called it something else: “a cultural tax” and “an irrevocable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's during the last few months is a complex combination of architects and entrepreneurs, some of which are initiated by the church's legal leaders and others of the bishops.
The Church Council, the head of the congregation, consisting of the legislators, wrote to the Bishop in July on his concern that the Bishop came to ‘try to impose the costs’ on the Church Council, despite the fact that the Church Council had not been involved in the introduction of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the Bishop.
Some son-in-law complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the Bishop.
Hai hurts three-year-old hammock in California
A hye attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he fell asleep in California on Saturday, the first day of the summer season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place about 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had covered with friends in about half an hour's morning when he heard the good cry for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to get the guy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the guy cried out of curiosity over having caught a hammock, but he realized that the guy cried 'I was beaten!
I was beaten!'
His whole leg was torn up," Hammel says, who discovered the damage when he reached the well.
"I cried that everyone had to come out of the water: 'It's a shark in the water!'" said Hammel.
The Gutten was transported with air exchange to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was presented is in critical condition.
The type of hye that carried out the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a couple of weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Gilles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Gilles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not treated as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its entry into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with similar beauty and beauty toys, equipped with special-educated employees.
The extended hills are tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong entry into the UK 2.8 million beauty market, which is still growing as the sales stations for clothing and home articles fall. If the attempt proves to be successful, the concept will be extended to several stores next year.
The investment in beauty play is a result of the Supermarket's attempt to find a new area of use for the place used for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said that they should double the number of beauty products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the shop chain has never sold before.
Existing product selection from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get a better place in marked areas, as in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket chain also aligns its Boutique brand with major vegan products, as there is growing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume trader The Fragrance Shop must test out sales boards in two Sainsbury's shops. It was opened in Croydon in southern London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network trade and a new trend to buy small quantities of food daily from local daily stores means that supermarkets need to make more time for customers to arrive.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that sales after each come to look like more and more at a shopping mall, as the supermarket takes up the fight against car stores Aldi and Lidl with several services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this increase has sold food and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the Supermarket to upgrade the beauty plays and apothecary departments was failed.
Sainsbury's test of cooperation with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was initiated after a series on the distribution of income from the appetites in the supermarkets.
The new strategy will follow that Sainsbury's sales to Celesio, owner of the pharmacist Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury hairdressers, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director of Sainsbury, said: "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beautiful toys to create more attractive surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in highly trained staff who should be so prepared to give advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to cover all needs, and the inviting environments and practical locations make us now a beauty player representing a new business experience.»
Peter Jones is "responsible" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' The Star Peter Jones must be quite curious after the TV-vert Holly Willoughby drew from an 11 million-year-old deal with his lifestyle label to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is program leader in This Morning announced on Instagram that she leaves the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The-star Peter Jones grueling by withdrawing from the prestigious life-style brand of theirs in the last seconds to focus on their new gold- stand-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was “associated” at a busy meeting on Tuesday at the main business quarter of his in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the gold of the television admitted that her new contracts – which have been worth up to GBP 1.5 million – means that she no longer has time to go beyond their clothes and accessories, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's markers, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated wealth of GBP 11 million.
At the same time as Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave Truly, leaving Jones United Kingdom on the way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was probably Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next ten years.
Everyone's completely shocked that she's chosen to move.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now a house is full of goods at the capital of Marlow which is now ready for sale.»
Experts believe that this morning's leader, among the most popular stars in Britain, can cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as powder and light, mote and cosceleral, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Trebor Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones (52) became the lead form in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has 40% of the owner's share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S trademark ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source that's close to Jones said yesterday "We won't comment on his business business".
Checkmates "and so we're in love with each other"
He pointed out the criticism he would have received from the media in order to come up with a comment some would consider to be a 'little presidential' and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump gone so far?
said Trump in his comparison with a novelty.
“I have not given away anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, even after having declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major obstacle on the way to nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear equipment have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a "compared response" from the United States on its former disarmament measures.
He noted that instead of the United States, the United States has continued sanctions aimed at keeping the press up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a collection of his voters.
"We do it very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a fighting relationship."
He said that his work to improve his relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as setting a stop for rocket tests, contributed to the release of hostages and to obtaining the lives of American service personnel sent home.
And he avoided his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to deal with Presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this step-by-step arena, we'd have around 200 people standing right here," Trump said and pointed in front of himself.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia breed an eye and take the lives of hundreds of people
In the cold water of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideal organisations were told that their aid was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of Lomboks had lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“In many cases, they have made it quite clear that they do not ask for international aid, so it is quite challenging,” said Sumbung.
Reded children are now joining a team to travel to Palu, but they are still not sure if foreign workers will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the national crisis management body, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluate the situation in Palu in order to ensure that international organisations are allowed to contribute to the work.
In view of the persistent challenges faced by Indonesia, the country is extremely poorly prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
Light to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not usually visible along other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of a warning series on Palu, although a warning has been sent, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Even in the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between many Indonesian eyes.
Natural disasters only make logistics more challenging.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's fallible infrastructure to a leading point in his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for the Jokos administration, which will be re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent secteristic tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have gone to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and several thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslims broke down in the streets with machets, chicken, and cattle and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with latest comparison in battle against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League attack on Chelsea on Saturday by cutting in 89 minutes at the battle at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea target while his lock was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The test went high above the box as the ball dropped against the top right corner of the net.
The ball came to an end over a bunch of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players that Shaq always sends the ball forward as well as it's going to do, so I just tried to give myself as good time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just picked it up."
Chelsea led with 1-0 at the stage, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a target in 25 minutes.
The Blues attack player sent a pass with the hero back to Matthew Kovacic, before he changed direction near the midway and printed it into the Liverpool road section.
Kovacic came with a quick survival on the central road.
He then took a great break-up that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-hand shot across Liverpool's Aliceson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the Championships League game at 5.00 a.m. on Wednesday at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia at 832
The deaths by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami have increased to 832, the country's crisis management unit announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many had been caught in the ruins of buildings that were collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 which covered the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six metres, explained Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from racist buildings.

We also ask all, in particular those who may have caught something on their camera, to contact – they may have information that is crucial to our research.»
A number of police confirmed that the deceased woman was a permanent resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
The following afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim.
A drug dealer living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been informed that no one gets permission to go in or out of the building.

Parliament's status of Cromwell is the last note entered into the crown on «recording history»
The removal of the status would be poetic justice for the similar destruction of many of England's cultural and religious taxes imposed by his fanatic Puritan allies.
But the History of the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Cricks as “sustainable” and “a attempt to rewrite the story”.
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also came to be a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistake will be punished for the sins of his ancestors Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic production of Cromwell is a proof of the meaning of the 1800s and is part of a history of a man who still deserves to be buried.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is getting by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, seen by Parliament's defense against press outside – in his time of course it was a talk about the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600's has formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing the one side of that conflict.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembered.»
Dried grass takes life from Chinese beads
A bond was attacked and killed by a grey on its market in South-West China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only by the name "Yuan", was found dead and covered by blood from a hungry pulse year near a bank on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reports South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A wheat association is ready to place a vaccine on rice at a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had evidently traveled with his fatter from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 greys on the market.
The morning after the fatter found him dead, and discovered that the door to a nearby pigeon was open.
He said that in the winter, it was a big mistake with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a medical examination confirmed that the 250 kg grey had killed the man.
“The leg of my fat was bloody and maltreated”, explained the fatter, mentioned by the successor Wu, in a seat at Guiyang Evening News.
The reception from surveillance cameras showed Yuan went into the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his gray.
Like he was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his fatter.
While the police all demonstrated from the scene one of the market leaders explained that the crisis was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and the management of the market are certain to negotiate compensation for the death.
Even though it's happening, it's not the first time it's recorded that a grey has attacked people.
In 2016 a gray-headed couple attacked a farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a walisic bond was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg grey to the woman of the bond was able to chase away the animal.
After a bond in Oregon was eaten by its Greeks in 2012 a bond from Manitoba to CBC News explained that Greeks are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can have an explosive effect.
"They're just funny.
They look like little bit, and they're very curious... they're trying not to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.»
The rest of the Rosa Orc will lead to a heavy rain in the southwestern United States
As reported, the source of Rosa is weakened by moving over the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry her flowers on her way through north-Mexico and southwestern USA over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was an Orc of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tree begins to be formed over the Pacific and moves east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California semi-wave on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to extend tropical moisture north to the south-west USA.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm downwards in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the noise that is approaching will lead to a massive rise in the south in the next days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm rain will lead to dangerous floods, moving Russians and quickly and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Dyptropic humidity will lead to lowering rates of up to 5 to 7 cm per hour in some areas, particularly south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm rain is expected in parts of the south-west country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flowering with fast-paced conditions due to the spread of the tropical rain.
It's very exclusive to move around in the desert to foot as long as it's dangerous for tropical descent.
Powerful rain can result in elvedals becoming broad-flewing rivers, and dryer will lead to local windmills that can contain dust and sand.
The demand that is close will lead to local strong buildings for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rainfall above 1,3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid Russian and fast, as well as smooth roads.
This will be the first downturn in the area of the accounting period.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain falls later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread to the coastal states on Tuesday and will last all Wednesday.
October may bring some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States, as Arctics become colder, but the troops are very hot.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over shorter distances.
We're going to see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout Central America on Sunday.
It will be almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Many parts of Central and Eastern USA will probably get a warm start on October, with degrees high on the tensile strength from Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern USA.
New York City can now reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate communication indicates that East-US is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people see the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million later, distributed on six TV networks, the Thursday's catch-up witness from the highest-ranking candidate, Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual abuse that had to take place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political party continued, and rounds broke out its regular messages to announce the great surprise of the Friday in the last seconds, when it appeared that Senator Jeff Flake had arranged it so that the FBI would conduct an inseparable investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's committee that she is 100% sure that a retired Kavanaugh ordered her and tried to take her clothes off at a youth school.
In a sadistic testimony burden, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100% sure that this didn't happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average serial numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The serial number was not immediately available for other networks that showed the sound, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen has problems with measuring officers as a rule.
To give a little perspective, this serial number corresponds to the end of the American football game or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose meanings have supported Kavanaugh's nomination with great enthusiasm, led by the network, with an average serial number of 5.69 million for the Christmas season, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two by 3.26 million later.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main person for the Friday drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the horse to a meeting in the court committee while demonstrators shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with a low look for several minutes while he was revealed, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I stand here like you," said one woman.
"Do you trust him to tell the country our truth?"
He heard that "you have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleke pointed out that his office had come with an opinion, and said that the doors closed that he had come to have more to say about the committee hearing.
The cable and round-casting networks covered all the hearing directly several hours later, as the Court’s committee would decide whether the appointment of Kavanaugh would be extended to the entire voting period.
But Flake said he was willing to do this only if the FBI investigated the complaints against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Fleke took his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
The choice of the flag had a great impact, since it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of "political game" around Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plans to leave the EU to run a 'political game' with the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May announces the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the part of her own side on the front page of the report, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU would receive the rates of each other was "very late".
Wayde Sims Shooting: The police attack Dyteon Simpson , who is suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
The police have attacked a man who is suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and intended for deliberate killing, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the basket.
The police found the glasses on the site and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After hearing Simpson, the police said he agreed to shoot and kill Wade.
His cause is set to USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The justice doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish published an interim report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a year of shock in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for their working group for the arrest of refugees, the State's police lab, the Southern University police and the local population for the contribution to the investigation that led to an attack.
LSU’s playwright leader Joe Aleva thanked the policy strength of the area for his "hard work and hunting on justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high front player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the building is "knush" and "in shock" after the death of Waydes.
"This is what we fear for any time," said Wade.
The valley floor of the ice over Mexico by
The ass that sprays off the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighborhoods in the capital of Mexico.
Centro Nácional de Preventción de Desastre, the Mexican public unit for crisis prevention, warned the Mexican population on Saturday that they had to remain single after the activity increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded during one day.
The Etate has monitored several cases of breast-feeding and breast-feeding.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of axles as covered by windscreens on cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south of the capital after a earthquake of 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the date of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors of independence had a meeting with the police, while several thousand were involved in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on release.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the opposition policy and bombed them with eggs and powdering, which caused dark dust holes in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handicraft also broke out later on the day when the police used to limit the shootings.
For several hours, independent demonstrators stood and cried «Never forget, never cry», face-to-face with Union demonstrators calling ‘Long life Spain’.
Forty persons were treated for minor damage they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the people's vote on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but free of separatist Catholics.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority of the resolution, but it was bad enough because the vote was defeated by the majority who were opposed to the liberation.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 persons were injured in violent confrontations in four years after the police tried to stop the vote carried out at electoral stations throughout the region.
The relief groups are in the streets at night for Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration remained, however, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist prosthesis with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalania's possibility of being independent.
"First we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy to get a vote, but now we are standing firm," he said.
Despite having achieved a small but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties that support catalytic independence have had problems with keeping the pressure up in the year, after which many of their famous leaders have moved into self-sustained exile or are in detention while awaiting legal action for their role in organizing the public vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said the conflict was triggered by politicians on both sides.
"The situation gets more and more tense," he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who have been imprisoned in the hope of a legal case since late in the fourth year, announced that he will be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To stand for elections as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and denial of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: A man arrested after driving a car into a house wall
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years of age have been arrested after a car was drove several times in the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19.30 p.m.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the event had caused damage on the door and the building itself.
A armrest may also have been turned off against the car at a time.
Mengas attack leads to Livingstons 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the winner
Livinston drowned Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 battles as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good encounter from Dolly Menga proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side is now just like Hibernian on the other side.
Gerrard's side has not yet won on the streets of Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of Hearts, who are eight points before them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will have to fight home against Rapid Wien in the European Union on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained unbelievably through six battles in the division. Chief Holt has not yet lost a fight after he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston forgets the possibilities against his slow guests
Holt's law would have been leading long before the score, as their direct procedure caused numerous problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but bombed on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the park back after sneaking in to meet Craig Halkett's head over the target.
The universe let Rangers play in front of themselves, well aware that they could create problems for their guests at deathball.
And that was how the decisive goal came to be.
Rangers gave himself a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give many clear paths, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
Meanwhile, Rangers had had the ball large enough time, but the defense of the house had proved to be uninterrupted and target guard Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in another half, even though Alfredo Morelos had performed a nearby score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangers Captain Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a short walk.
Crisis was still in the Livingston box and was still saved, while two criminal requirements – once after Halket's protest against the replacement of Glenn Middleton, and once before hand - were translated.
‘Fenomenal’ from Livingstone – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were fantastic all together, and they continued to overcome all expectations on the way up.
The game and the human being has suddenly changed since they came to the top again, but Holt must have much respect for the way he has strengthened the building after his arrival.
He had a lot of stuff.
Captain Halket was fantastic and coordinated a huge well-organized defense, while many held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at the top throughout the fight.
At the same time, Rangers didn't have my inspiration to break up with.
Even though they have been very good under Gerarrd for some time, they were not able to live up to this standard.
The last part of the battle was labs – they only entered the street section of the house once – and it was a bit of a wake-up for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just sweet and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There has been a breakdown in issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new Moscow.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police provided security as the reason for a population of 25,000 were not allowed to assemble in front of the mosque, but many of the allies met in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan – many of them worse – also listened to, and criticized both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to release him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is held as a whole by some German poets and hated as an autocrat of others.
Deptford Collision: List of diseases killed in collision with car
A sicklist is killed in a collision as with a personal car in London.
The collication took place in the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a road road in the South Deptford city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cycle was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the ground.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclical death in a race where the driver dropped off the scene in the Child's Street, about one mile from the Saturday's college.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and warn the people concerned.
Travelling and bus rides are in place, and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured in work
Six prison officials are injured in an incident by a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Opens bread at HMP Long Larsin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and continues.
Specialized “Tornado” officers have been introduced to manage the event, involving eight inputs and are limited to one flight.
The agents were treated for minor eye damage on the ground.
One member of the prison service said: "Special training personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing event at HMP Long Lartin.
Sex workers have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – the officers will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend more time behind lockdown and strike.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 insulated houses, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by an employee.
And in October of the previous year, the opposition policy was called upon to deal with a serious event in which the employees were attacked with billiards.
The body of Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flowers (may be pleasant for dry areas)
It is the Arizona field being hit by a tropical low pressure, but it will likely happen early next week, as the remaining force of the Rosas moves through the deserts in the south and leads with its flowers.
National Weather Service has already issued flowers for Mondays and Tuesdays for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainforest will begin late Monday evening.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has observed on Twitter that “the tropical cycles have only maintained the status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a well to it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.’
The most recent National Hurricane Center models provide 5-10 cm below, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolia Rome in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the south-west, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to be between 2,5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm downhill is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flower tree, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flowering is a serious problem, some of this drop-down will probably be pleasant, since the southwestern USA is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's minimum extreme dry, which is the nearest highest category," according to weather.com.
First, the Russian country is hit by the Mexican semiarid Baja California.
Rosa still has power power on Sunday morning, with maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific and thus loses power.
It is therefore expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm power Monday night or afternoon.
The download of parts of Mexico can be strong and can lead to great floods.
‘Tomorrows of 7.5–15 cm are expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm downwards’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm to reach the border of Arizona on Wednesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
‘The main danger expected by Rosa or the rest of it is very severe decline in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the south-west desert in the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This dropper is expected to produce life-threatening flowers and moving Russians and fast in the desert and soil areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four assaults for killings

Trump says that Kavanaugh has “suddenly and mind” to the Democratic Party
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the careless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in front of a public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suddenly and mind" to the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday, and associated with strong and sensitive complaints from Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed sexual assault on her for several decades since they were teenagers.
Ford is also a witness to his complaint during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that "the American people were so brilliant, clever and courageous" that day.
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most powerful lawyers of our time, with unlimited public service resources," he told a collection of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred discré to the appointment of Kavanaughs when he spoke about the importance of the vote by the Republicans at the inter-elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not actually a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
‘That is why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.’
Drump insists that the Democrats have the objective of "resisting and preventing".
The first interim vote of the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the figures are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were thrown out into the sea by huge waves that drowned against the shores when a large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves flooded the country around sunset, destroyed everything in its way, and poured many out in the dying.
Tsunami came into the brains on an earthquake with 7.5 strength.
"When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people still ran with activities on the beach, didn't fall immediately and end up as victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a figure for Indonesia's crisis management unit (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami wasn't alone – the drier with its cars, trailers and houses, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, and let the tsunami have moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastal line.
Some fell up in trees to escape from the tsunami and survive.»
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management agency showed many damaged buildings and shops, damaged and broken bridges and a mossy area of water.
Afternoon continued to cross the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be identified by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's assessment and use of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power from the vast earthquake of the Friday was about 200 times more than the power of atomic bombs that were dropped over Hiroshima during World War 2.
The location of the city at the end of a long, small roof may have made the tsunami larger, according to the weather.
Nugroho described the damages as ‘stupid’ and said that thousands of dwellings, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have been destroyed.
The likes of some of the victims were found caught in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and let 540 people be injured and 29 were injured.
Nugroho said that the deaths and damages could be the coast of the larger country 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donghea, which is located close to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely corrupted, completely without information’ from Donegha, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said Red Cors in a press release, and let their staff and volunteers be on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
On Saturday, the state was severely criticized for not having informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said the waves had taken them before the warning was issued.
In an amateur campaign on social media, a man in the upper stage of a building is hearing desperate warnings about the approaching tsunami on the road below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water falls to the beach and flows with its buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the entries.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power crash that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has started sending transport flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the refugees still have a desperate need for food and other needs.
The city's airport is only open for assistance, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo shall visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday following the plan.
The death rate for the tsunami in Indonesia is above 800.
It's so ugly.
World Vision staff from Donghea have come safely to the Palu center, where they have sought light during the presentation at the farm site before their office, but they have suffered great damage along the way, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses," he said.
It's so ugly.
As relief organisations began their intense preparations to provide emergency assistance, the complaint was simply that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis zone before being declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a figure for Indonesian Red Cors.
"When the government says 'Greet, this is a national disaster', we can open the borders for international aid, but the situation has not yet been able to get any status'.
As the sun rises over Palu for another time after the earthquake of peace and the tsunami hopes friends and family of those still missing to be among the miracle stories that shed light on the dark news picture after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little pretty fished out of a clock.
On Sunday a woman was released by rescuers after spending two days in ruins with the joy of her mother beside herself.
Gendon Subanono, the trainer of the national paradigm, had experienced two of the missing paraglids of Asia, which had been carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Many of those who were arrested in the ruins of Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandiya, were also his students.
"As an adult in parallel, I have my own feelings to bear," he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news about the collapsing of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to the performers who participated in the beach festival on Palu.
But the messages only led to gray hack marks, as well as a few blue hack marks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Tever stars USD 26 750 under minibank filling in Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, USD 26 750 stole from a Brink's worker who filled a mini bank in Newport on the Live, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a mini bank in the maintenance complex and made it clear to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who was "run behind the Brink's employee" and stole a cash check that would be delivered.
So many suspects from the scene, according to the press report, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the event.
All who have information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation was previously known as Kanye West.”
West (41) had named Ye over a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande with the program after she canceled on “emotional basis”, according to the serialist.
In addition to being a summary of the current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the Big Boy Radio.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many well-known rappers who've changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but in the year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of links and large letters.
Mexico AMLO challenges not to use the military against civilians
The Vice-President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has stressed that he should never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of blood-repressions against students.
Lopez Obrador's promise at Tlatelco Plaza on Saturday that he “will never use the military to undermine the Mexican people”.
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the street on October 2, 1968, and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements broke across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to criminal offences.
The US should double financial support for artificial intelligence
After each China becomes more active within artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use for research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, the investor and the exercise of artificial intelligence, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments will follow that several sections of the American government have come with announcements of artificial intelligence, although the United States does not generally have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan in four and aims to be number 1 before innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are on the hunt after the next big break," said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next major performance within artificial intelligence comes from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» was published by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the first companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artistic intelligence as the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese division.
Lee recognized the US government's previous technological competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when it will be stopped, to help find the next generation's heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to get state funding, according to Lee.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders, it's the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed clock heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a degree of artificial intelligence should receive an automatic residence permit offer," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China National Natural Science Foundation finance people by academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations spend money on researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
In the past year, the United States Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment on USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, they currently invest more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the American legislation aimed at establishing a national safety committee for the creation of artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in favour of the change in the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a public vote on Sunday on whether they should change the country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia to resolve a long-term dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become EU and NATO.
Hellas, who also owns a province on behalf of Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has brought down the issue of including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new ship, but national opponents argue that the amendment would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian slave population.
President Gjerge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycotting campaign has created doubts about whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 per cent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the vote will be: ‘Are you for NATO and EU members when approving the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change in name, including Minister of State Zoran Zaev, argue that it is necessary to pay this price so that Macedonia, a country established after the fall of Yugoslavia, will be able to become a member of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective umbrella, because it means a secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be decisive because a large number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Committee has said they had not received any irregular reports by 13 a.m.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, as 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children – we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Struca, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The people's vote in Macedonia is about to change the country's name in order to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and drew up chairs in front of the halls set up by those who were to vote.
"We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we want to be notified with high head, don't get thrown in the back," Kavadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we have our value.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.’
State Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to such dedicated investment in Macedonia, which has a employment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think most of them will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to be members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He says that a "yes" answer will be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey conducted last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voting rights participants in the referendum will be lower than the required meeting.
Another study carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 per cent of the respondents have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these 70 percent said they came to vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the meeting must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the public vote fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle to the pro-west government's support since it took over in May four.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero manoeuvres across the entire Bridgetons defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Bridgeton defense in Manchester Citys 2–0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero got it to look slowly out when he scored a target in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He was running around with three Brighton defenders before he came out on the open road.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green holes.
He came around one defense before he walked from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shot to hit Brighton's driver Matthew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the network.
“Aguero is still facing some foot problems”, said the City Manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
"We talked about he came to play 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky he scored a goal right there."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful break-up pass along the left side to Leory Sane.
True had a couple of injuries before he led Sterling against the longest corner.
Sky Blues attack player sent the ball into the net right before it was over the deadline.
The city plays against Hoffenheim in the Championships League team at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhea-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a mirror for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and there is no reason to be strong.
The same competitive Scherzer, however, hopes to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado Layer, leading over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies received a wild card space with a 5-2 victory over the National Friday evening, but is still out after ensuring their first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the vote here in Denver, with the audience and the second layer, will be what is most likely to be the highest level of fight I've got to play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced its starting pitches for the Sunday, but must certainly be ready to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in this case is starting points for 34 times, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and would fall with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-wing Washington player has won 18 battles this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trumps People's Assembly in West Virginia
The President pointed out the discrepancies of the situation around the Supreme Court, Mr Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of the inter-election of the Republicans.
“All we have done is on the game in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued «You see this huge, huge group with radical democracies, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back for any price.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't have to give them.»
Democrats, he said, have the goal of "resisting and preventing".
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, and called the democracies "sinful and corrupt and corrupt and unjust".
He referred to the Senate's judicial committee and referred to democratic Senator Diane Feinstein on behalf of the audience.
"Do you hear her answer?
Have you read the document?
Um, um, uh.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
The lab is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say what they mean
As Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am nevertheless the last of a number of Members of the Labour Parliament who have been informed that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I would have been disappointed because I wasn't in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
As to how important it is to have responsible economic policies, national security, Europe – ironically enough similar things that Jeremy had in common with previous leaders.
On Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting, we said that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour Representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been precisely this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the vote at many of the meetings, and the promise of 'more, more friendly' policy is too long forgotten if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party.
This began a short time after Jeremy was led, when my colleagues previously thought that I was sharing many political positions with a sudden start to expect me to take a U-swift and stand for what I had never agreed before, not the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and there is nothing to say what I say – I receive a lot of small social media messages that require me to be rejected, I condemn central policy and tell me that I should not be involved in the Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than any of my fellow Members, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea of gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never everything goes wrong.
One of the most shocking aspects of this political era is how gross exclusion has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every motion of miscellaneousness and every change in the electoral rules will make the party easier.
I have received much advice in the last two years where I am invited to hold my head down and not raise the vote so much, because it will “do everything better”.
But that was not why I was involved in politics.
Since I was involved in the Labour 32 years ago as a schoolmaster, experienced by the failure of the Thatcher government, which had led to my class room at the public school which I had literally said was fallible, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillors and government ministers.
I have never hidden my political views, nor in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can somehow have misunderstood my political positions or differences with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I would simply say that because the country breeds our way towards a Brexit that will harm private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot take and understand what I wish to waste time and strengths on my loyalty to the Labour Leader.
But the message I really want to deliver is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of rejection or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best exceeds their interests.

Year 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbelieving Ayr ascends to tops
Two years ago, the final result has changed a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic maintenance of Tennt's Premiership.
They're now on top of the table, and they're the only unobstructed of the ten.
Finally, there was the same amount of their relative defence as their ability to use the opportunities they got that led the housewife to leave with the winner, and trainer Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our wars so far and still unbelievably, so I must be satisfied with it," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better to use the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's trial in 14 minutes, with a target park from Frazier Climo Ga Ayr management, but a gold card to the Scottish estate of Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, lot Melrose finished the position, and Jason Baggot performed a trial without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's management with a penalty park before he, right before pause, scored and targeted a solo trial to change the position of 17-5 at break.
But Melrose started another half strong, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
After this there was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruardh Knott, which had been thrown out on the bar, and since the beginning, Ayr's management has increased more than ever a test from Stafford McDowell, with climate target park.
Ayr's functioning captain, Blain Macpherson, then got gold card and Melrose used it to have an extra man on the road to the full with a test from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the householder came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card to have taken Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson played a touchdown at the entrance behind the impressive Ayr-Mauul.
Climo provided a target park, as he did almost completely from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's boxing and sent flags Gregor Henry rented for the fifth domestic exam.
Set game star ready for a new career in the restaurant brand
It appears that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on its way into the service industry – it has recently been discovered that he is named director of a restaurant company with a license.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, which he writes manuals for and plays with his long-term comedy partners, Greg Hemhill.
The duen has announced that the next ninth season will become the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the Director of the Operations Morning Limited.
The actress wouldn't comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "live restaurant industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country without a coastal line, hopes that the right will open the way to the Pacific Sea
The seamen patrol a giant marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a self-defense flag.
Marine bases from the Titicacas Sea to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The whole country of India has still freshly remembered the coastal line they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country is long after enough time to sail on the Pacific.
These expectations may be greater than they have been for several decades, as Bolivia expects a recognition from the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has driving power, community hands and mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the knowledge of the International Court of Justice on large screens in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its knowledge in favour of Bolivia's claim that Chile, after several decades of sporadic negotiations, is obliged to negotiate to provide Bolivia with its own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put a lot of emphasis on the knowledge of Monday.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the right to take Bolivia's party will soon, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN body, which has remained in the Netherlands, has no authority to remove the Chilean territories and has promoted that it will not resolve the outcome of any negotiations.
That the knowledge of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the last arguments were heard that the case was "not complicated", according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And besides promoting Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may actually have done things worse.
"The problem with access to the sea has been overcome by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has removed any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative at Haag, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unexpectedly.
According to him, Monday will provide Bolivia with “a unique opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile” and the possibility of ‘putting an end to 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties’.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – which is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – have used the maritime situation as a political nightmare.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“The knowledge is a reason to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear equipment won't happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never defeat its nuclear weapons if they cannot rely on US authorities.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to respect the commitments they made during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments will, at the same time, appear as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo to be ready to launch the established atomic diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a 'willing dream' to continue sanctions and American resistance is a declaration that ends the Korean War at times will force North Korea into ignorance.
The US authorities are skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant decommissioning measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want another meeting.
But it is widely doubted whether Pyongyang really has plans to leave an arsenal country likely to see as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo has plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Anti-monitions in Paris reveal the last in huge headlights, which are on the way towards a dress shop near you
If you want to have some big addition to the hate collection or hide yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne drew a selection of a separate, over-dimensional headplate as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which imposed the counterlights on the wall of Paris.
Very ineffective haters have been popular in Instagram in summer, and these designers have sent their infamous creatures down the catwalk.
Valentinos most noticeable beach was an overcrowded leg painted with a fire-like broad brake that pressed the heads of the models.
The other over-dimensioned accessories include frozen melons, a trollmann hat or even an anaanas, but are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also issued a selection of eternal masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had replaced leaves and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scratch.
One creature remembered the deck equipment, including snorkels and deck glasses, while the other looked like a dirty ice cream in the kitchen.
And if you're out after even greater resistance, then you're lucky.
Stile experts predict that the huge hats may be on the way to a dress shop near you.
The over-dimensional horses come right into the halls of "La Bomba", the beam with a half-meter wide bridge that has been seen on everyone and everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark behind the very ineffective hat as dominated social media has now sent another great creature down the catwalk – a beach basin in a stream that is almost as large as the bath-drawer model bearing it.
The orange raffia layer, which is bordered with raffic rings and complemented with a white skin handle, was the most impressive creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris.
“I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the clothing shops next summer – when the designer has had such a great impact, it will be difficult to overcome the demand after oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to the world’s citizens
The free schools of Scotland still show academic discretion, and this has been maintained in 2018 with some one year's excellent exam results. These are supported by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council), have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, and work hard to provide the best school experience for both students and parents.
Frisks aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their selected careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a step-by-step school pension, we see that modern languages are still a popular and demanding choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands when the words are his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words will be in his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just keep ourselves in English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the year's exam results, we see that languages are above the table with the highest percentages from fresh schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received exam character A.
The data obtained from 74 members of the Free School Council showed that 72 per cent of students received test A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that new schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a decisive skill of children and young people will need in the future.
Languages as professionals are now valued at the same level as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics on pensions for fresh schools and other places.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for the reasons given by employers, problems with free employment could be attributed to 17 per cent lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
Each time more and more jobs require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned another language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, regardless of which career you choose.
The ability to communicate directly to people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent were able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only two-digit number of participants (15 per cent).
This is the reason that investment in language education is now crucial for today's children.
Being able to speak more languages, especially those related to growing economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school is taught in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered most valuable to Britain on the road to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a choice of languages to choose between free schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish schools are aimed at creating a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with knowledge and skills to succeed regardless of what the future may bring.
In today’s global business environment, language is still crucial for the country’s future, and this must be reflected in the teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as ‘International Communicationability’.
Frescoles will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and labelling to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will have his Lakers' wedding on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James game for the first time in Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening battle of Sunday's spring against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The number of minutes he's gonna play is still not determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-player driving plan.
"I don't need a ride camp at this stage of my career," he said.
Time for the Trumps People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
The President will start a number of elections at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five crowd meetings planned for the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his elected High Court candidate is pending, Trump has the objective of obtaining support for the forthcoming interim elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the elections are going to the vote in November.
When the Trump West Virginia public meeting is at night, and how can it be seen on the web?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia will start at 19.00 ET in the evening on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's public meeting in West Virginia on the network below via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the hearings of the week for the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual abuse. A expected confirmation vote has been put to wait until one week while the FBI is investigating the matter.
The main objective of all these referendums is to support republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five popular meetings over the coming weeks have the objective of "comprehensive voluntary and support players trying to protect and expand the majority of the participants' and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Convention control is so decisive for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we move towards a travel campaign season," Reuters was told by a campaigner for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening’s public meeting, to be held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from the ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania, covered by the Pittsburgh press’, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be another time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is based on the considerations.
"It is a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a promise on the measurements," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows struggle to maintain faith as they enter Sunday's single-game
After three isolated sessions on Saturday afternoon, Thursday's foursomes may have been exactly the year's Ryder Cup needed.
The moving pendulum of the moment is a fully discovered game concept, but yet some players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the moment is now?
"They led with six points and now it's four, so we bring it with us as a little moment," said Jordan Spieth when he left the road for the day.
Europe will, of course, have the advantage – they lead four points and it is 12 again to play for.
But as Spieth says the Americans feel they've got a little wind in the islands again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and they both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered the remarkable game from tea to grass, and leads by example.
The deep fissures were raised after each as the round continued, and gave to a decisive pultating to raise the match to an uneven when he and Thomas were two below two.
His pudding, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar cry — of the sort that shows that he still does not think that the American layer is harmless.
"We really need to just put all the balls into and focus on our own match," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players have now.
18 hole to make an impression.
The only players who have got more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are probably Ryder Cups great success story.
The extraordinary but noble pair of Europe have four and do not make a mistake.
‘Moliwood’ was the only couple who avoided a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine nights of Friday morning.
These results and how their energy looks to move both to and from the living population make it clear that they are the greatest competitors of the sun, and no other players will see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National rather than Freewood or Molinari.
Anyway, both at the same time, in every hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe as the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson managed to get up with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was a partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two double in the course of the first nine dreams the Spanish and Swedish were so far behind that they did not have the nub bean to take the forbidden again.
But on Sunday, there's no help getting.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely at the relationship between the couple, the advice they give each other, the advice they do not give, and how a strategy can turn for a moment.
Europe has played better than it has played so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has failed in some areas, especially in the United States.
Europe runs 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong commitment at the start of Ryder Cups the last day, after completing the Sunday's fourballs and foursomes match with 10-6 leadership against the USA.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two viewers against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised his score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Two years ago, Thomas Björn's European side, fighting to keep the trophies lost at Hazeltine, dominated America's infamous side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The US gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't take any more of the advance.
Jim Furyk's side has to get eight points from the 12 single-day sun to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European Rocky to have four points on row, and he and Molinari – who together have been called "Molliwood" after a sensory weekend – are the only couple who have received four points from their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cups.
After cutting Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourball, they cooperated with the sleepless to beat down Woods and the American Rocky Bryson Dechambeau with one more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who stayed through two matches on Saturday, smiled at the inside, but now has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven on row.
Justin Rose, removed from the tomorrow's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and awarded a 2&1-ship against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is ranked as number one and three on a global basis.
But Europe did not get all the way they wanted on this hot day with a light bridge south of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard catch of 2&1 sails over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in Foursomes after losing the first two dreams.
Only two times in Ryder Cups history has a layer ready to enter after a four-point advance at the beginning of the single-game, but as the current holder only needs Furyks' side to get unsecured to keep the trophies.
But after having been the best in two days, it doesn't seem that they will be able to deliver a brain attack on Saturday.
North Korea will ‘not in any way’ join one side of the run-down without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United States on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened the mystery against the United States, and that the country would not in any way contribute to unilateral release of its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual general meeting that North Korea has carried out a significant ‘best welfare measure’ during the last year, for example by halting nuclear and Missile Tests, demobilizing the nuclear test area and by not spreading nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any similar response from the United States," he said.
"In the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not give up on ourselves suddenly under some circumstances."
Ri again welcomed North Korean complaints on Washington's opposition to a gradual atomic equipment, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual detonation of the ground, but his statement was significant because it did not completely reject unilateral atomic equipment, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, during which all the first meeting between a sit-in president of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim agreed to work against the 'atomical equipment of Koreahalvøa' while Trump guaranteed the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has remained a formal end to the Korean War, which took place from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also faced challenges to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
‘The US insists on ‘atomical equipment first’ and has been pressured by sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and is opposed to the ‘declaration of the end of the war’, according to Ri.
“The fact that sanctions can force us into the process is a dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions create further misunderstandings.»
Ri did not mention the plans for another encounter between Kim and Trump as the US leader underlined earlier this week.
In the meantime, the Minister raised three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae over the last five months, saying: ‘If the other party in this decommissioning case were South Korea, or the United States, the nuclear power supply of Korea would not have been as determined as it is.’
However, the tone of Ris' speech was very different than that of the fourth year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack against the United States of America with North Korea rockets was inevitable after Mr. Onde President Trump called Kim a "racetman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to ‘completely destroy’ North Korea in four years, there was a storm in front of the UN and rose Kim to be brave enough to take the downturn, but said that much work remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is the nuclear waste.
On Wednesday he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
But US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced strongly and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear equipment."
The Security Council has consistently increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to undermine the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sides of the UN General Assembly, and said he would visit Pyongyang again the next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He came from Pyongyang in July and said that they had made progress, but only hours after the North Korea accused him of having come with “aggressive demands”.
North Korea committed itself to a meeting with Moon this month to lay down a Missile Area and an atomic fuel plant if the United States did ‘compared measures’.
He said Kim had said that these "compared measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise the relationship to Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help the students to get more sleep by taking the growing culture of smoking through the night with coffee drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the top of the world's university often did not have any idea how they would take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he held a lecture on the effect of sleep failure on learning.
"Then a girl came out to me, saying, 'Why has no one said this before?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts in the year, explains the students how important it is to have good sleep habits in order to perform academic and sports, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for the university's health services, said the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffer from serious sleep problems.
The course, which takes one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, it is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, gardens, jogges and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance are affected by sleeplessness, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants will learn how long-term sleep failure can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons allows participants to think about their own daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not change the students' behaviour immediately.
But we think they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk by smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a certain pride in being able to push all night, he said, and let modern technology and the growing pressure on the students lead to sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students' 'secret weapons' against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of growth, when sleeplessness puts the brain in a sulte mode, which leads to constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course. He took one of the classes to the professor in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire camp.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all Master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on an alarm for when they would be as well as for when they would stand up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light could disrupt the daily routine and lead to sleep disorders.
Livingstone 1–0 Rangers: The objectives of many strike Gerrard's men
Ranger's lead is quite an exception when Dolly Menga's goal was to release Steven Gerrard's team from 1 to 0 at Livingstone.
The Ibrox page wanted to get his first victory since February from 4 to 1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerarrd's second losses on 18 battles as manager and finally his eight points from the Ladbroke Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Many slots up to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to compare.
Rangers are now falling down in six places, while Livingston climbs up to three and is behind Hibernian in a different direction.
There may be more trouble in the case of Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a headache after an item was cast out of the public.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the board, which the party passed through Ayr and entered the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Instead, Holt went for the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy to see how his well-wished leg broke the resistance.
Rangers may have most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should've scored only two minutes in the game when Mengas first pass sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goals, but the middle player lost the chance.
A long break by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if their game slowed down more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he'd have a criminal park after a quarter when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Ranger's only two hits on targets for the first time, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly didn't get problems with Lassana Coulibally's head and a stupid piece from Ovie Ejaria.
While Lewis opening in 34 minutes may have been against the game's move, no one can deny that they deserve it for the effort.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard exchanged Coulibaly with Ryan Kent at the time, and the player gave immediate results when the player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the other players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, while Lithgow and Halkett caught a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could have drawn the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the head of Lithgow from the corner.
Rangers' exchanger Glenn Middleton had a late demand for a criminal park while he was at the port in conflict with Jacobs, but then Thomson left.
Almanacs: Founder of Gegitellers
And now a page from the Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the gegirator.
The Gegittler has been an important part of science since then, and has also been part of popular culture through the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man says: "What is in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser, it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you take these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that radioactivity in the minerals causes.»
Evans, "Let's say it makes sound now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the discovery he gave his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
The new cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them.
The vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immunitys from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
Cells can “see” a protein that is common in many cancers and are then injected in the patient again
A vaccine during trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, experienced that her ovarian cancer had passed on for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immunitys from a patient, modifying them into the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then inject these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda in Maryland said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 «Driver growth of different types of cancer» includes breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, which was taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to address cancer cells, has been effective in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, led by a MAGA hat, came with a strong defense of Trump after the SNL attack.
It didn't work.
Kanye West was founded in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a famous performance where he awarded US President Donald Trump a bill and said he wanted to vote in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, Ghost Town, introduced a Make America Great Again-hatt, held him against the Democrats, and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I speak to a white person, and then he says to him, "How can you look like Trump, he's really racist?"
If I was saved for racism, I had moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star made a joke by Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual abuse presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't rounded up, West was caught up in social media by comedians Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to let the West settle by adding the deal.
West also complained to the public that he had heard it on the back room about the choice of headlights.
"But move it.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
But move it!
And then they said I don't remember what reality is," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see that I remember what the reality is?" He said, "Take me the Supermann hat, because then no one can say what I'm going to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.»
The comments were made at least twice, and the employees who worked on SNL were so flexible, reported Variety, who said to a staff member: “The whole study was dead.”
West was introduced as the last little replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song “I Love It” dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of our bravest: TAKK FOR YOUR STAR IMPOT MASSENE.”
But speakingshowed Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is just "because he is and it's totally fantastic".
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his “art”) which I mean to grow up and ask for ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
It's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. He said from now on he was “the officially known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapperly Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion. So it is, of course, the dead musical Prince, who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

The focus will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Longer Against "Gift Masculinity"
Kit Harington is known for its role as the Swedish winner Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the middle age, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has gone out and criticised the stereotypes of the machohelt and says such roles in movies often get young men to believe that they must be smart enough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that something has gone wrong and wrong about how to attack the problem with "severe masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, recently married to the Game of Thrones-Coller Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very busy with the subject.
"It worries me very much for the time – where did it go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit thinks that TV can have parts of the cause of the increase in "study masculinity" due to the strong masculinity roles.
He continued, "What is born of you and what is born of you?"
What is broadcast on TV and on the street, what makes young men feel that they must worship this side by being a man?
I think it is one of the really big questions in our time – how can we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledges that he will not make any progress or follow-up of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is “completed with hit marks and horses”.
From November, Kit will play the main role in a new game of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a racer.
The actress recently concluded that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife during the exercises, so that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as the Kitts role figure Jon Snow is engaged in, in the Emmy prized fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
Hiv/aids: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are trapped in the country, says a health representative.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, which marks a change from previous times.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way is now closer zero, said Chinese health personnel at a conference in the Yunnan province.
Years ago, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in the China LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men have sex, after each marry women.
Many of the diseases are due to insufficient protection in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have allowed general access to HIV-medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to co-operate collected data on Republican senators, functions of «hazardous lies» and «conspiration theories»
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, refused a hearing on the fact that members of her staff had provided personal information to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lobbymakers.
The democracy of Los Angeles secured by claims was presented by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and web pages.
"Layers, lies and more rejected lies," said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information included the address and telephone numbers of United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday, set up by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the overarching complaints against the Supreme Court of Cavanaugh.
The lecture came a little after the three senators had challenged Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the installation was tracked to Waters' office and closed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
"This unfounded complaint is completely incorrect and a regular lie," said Waters.
‘Members of my step - who have been compromised by their identity, personal information and security as a result of these false and false accusations - had absolutely nothing to do with the leaking of this information.
This unfounded complaint is completely incorrect and a regular lie.’
Waters' opinion was quickly criticised on the network, among others of former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This statement is aggressive," wrote Fleischer.
“This means that she does not have the right to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be aggressive.
They don't have to defend themselves.
They must not question the motives of the complainant.
They must act quietly and be taken.’
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too aggressive during the Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters from the intermediate elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Stort – if it is true”, he tweeted.
In his opinion, Waters said that her office had warned the "relevant authorities and the police about these false charges".
“We will ensure that the making persons are disclosed”, she continued, “and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous for each of my steps”.
Registration of Johnny English Stries Again – bloodless Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has now become a tradition to look after Brexit's findings in all new films with a British stage and it seems to be relevant for this repetition of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Do you want sarcastic self-sacrifice about how obvious hope we are to be the new exporters of the nation?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his blind eyes and rubber face has renewed his license to rotate it for another time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with non-English cinema.
He is certainly the patient secret agent who, despite his distinguished James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a dész Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one note in the music entry with the theme of fire in the opening ceremony at OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the longest forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery that leaves chaos everywhere.
It's one and the other great moment in the last Johnny English drive.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in mid-age equipment and the rotor leaves cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to his right, but the humor is quite bloody and highly overflowing, especially now as the "serious" brands like 007 and Mission Unable to voluntarily avoid the comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed towards the child than the adults, and for me, Johnny English's forests are not as exciting and eating as the stupid movies in Mr. Bean.
The current estimate is that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super secret web network of spies and reveals the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the conduct of the maintenance agent – a sorry little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last strike of a minister of state, a pump and a broken figure that is already undergoing a full crisis of political instability: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this as well as the Teresa May role, but the manual does not give her much to work with.
Retirement advisors inform her that since each active spy has been released, she must enter any of the pensioners.
And that means the cloned Johnny English, who is now working on a snobbed station, but gives informal teaching in secret business. There are some kind of sequences here when English offers a rock Academy for spy activity.
English will be rushed back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and refurbished with its old, crying assistant Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, played with a commander, a hysterical cross-class role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin's style of rotting everything to the queen's orders is back where they confront Olga Kurylenko's fantastic five fatalities, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Ministry of State is led by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the British cyber problems: the luxury Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the trip with far-active side-steps: dressed as servers put the boys at a relaxing French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board in Volta lususyacht; and English solves the pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in the Voltas house.
All the stops are really drawn out before the last sequence, but still so cute and exciting it's so much to remember about children's TV with all the noise.
Think of it as a means, it's all.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think of anything else: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really got his talent?
Labor finds that they are preparing plans to let the United Kingdom work four-day work, but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party shall assess a radical plan that will give the British four-day job market – but pay for five.
The Party will be able to make it clear that business leaders should use the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekend free.
This will result in employees receiving a three-day rest, while they will be paid the same wage.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to four-day survey so that workers can also benefit from the new economy.
A senior in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
‘It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day survey is an ambition that matches the party’s wish to allow the pendulum to shift to the benefit of the workers, in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The work will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party released fourdays during the campaign before Parliament's election in 2017.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A speaker for Labour said: "A quarter-day survey is not the party's policy and is not something that is assessed by the party".
A financial speaker for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to expand its vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power from "unskilled directors" and "professionals" of public service providers.
The plan of the shadow Chancellor also means that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not returning the entire share post because a Labour Government can make a “retribution” out of perceived unfairness.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate governance and set up an employee fund to transfer 10% of the equity to companies in the private sector to employees, which may receive an annual exchange of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI border of Kavanaugh can get them to change their mind
The FBI branch of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put forward a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least one week's appointment and raises the question of whether the Agency's finding could be obtained by some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview that was sent Sunday, Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open about it than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was firmly determined, scoring, decisive.’
However, Graham's voice seems to be raised in stone.
"I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it must be an optimum finding," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: the board blessed the energy," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of them could confirm it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has contributed to the fight against poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosted for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and a similar impressive mission; the world's poverty was eliminated.
Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will get thousands of people to stream to the great plenary in Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness about the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
In order to obtain the free image for the event (except if you are willing to pay for a VIP picture), participants must perform a number of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary work, send e-mail to a world leader, take a phone or other meaningful ways to increase awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But where has the success of Global Citizen been when it's only 12 years ago to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a genius way of getting people to fight for change, or just a case of so-called "clickiveism" - that people feel a great deal about signing a signature campaign on the network or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says they have registered more than 19 million "actions" since 2011, with a range of objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to world leaders to declare obligations and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and notices as a result of their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main concerns are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and foundations based in the United Kingdom, which will “help children to exploit their full potential”, and promised to give Rwanda $35 million in order to assist in eradicating the country’s counterfeiting after receiving over 4700 tweets from the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens as you, we can make social injustice undermining a footnote in history”, told Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions in the United Kingdom to better feed mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will now reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "what makes you believe that we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global citizenship replied: “It will be a long and difficult way – in short, we will fall and fail.
But as important citizens' rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée is one of the artists who will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the sea as a 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of the Interior
Washington could ‘if necessary’ for the sea in order to prevent Russian energy when markets, inter alia in the Middle East, were closed by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zincke argued that Russia's exposure to Syria – especially when they operate after an invitation from the legal government – is a challenge to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the numbering person, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
"The US has the opportunity to ensure that the seas are open, and, if necessary, blockers to ensure that energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organization that is profiled as the ‘word of energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways to deal with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are the same along the way.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The opinions came after the Tromp administration had been on a roundabout to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and they wanted to replace Russia, the most cheap option for European consumers.
The staff of the Trump administration, including the President himself, therefore tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the ‘inadequate’ project The North European Gas Corps 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin’s ‘patch’.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which will double existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's global opposition to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Minister for Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
The German industry's leading organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to maintain EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have great problems with third countries that are blending into our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the leader of BDI following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" her presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" whether she would be presidential candidate after the interim elections.
At a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she wanted to stand.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and get the dirty government, and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether I shall be appointed as President’.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he ‘leaded the country in the wrong direction’.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his highest-ranking candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI bordering before voting".
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think that it should take place in 2020.
58% of ‘probably’ voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The assessment showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidate and 48% opposed it.
Other highly-professional democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidate in 2020 are Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Please say he would be officially appointed by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin notes Track Palins PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after he died in September.
He was arrested and targeted for a house-to-house Sunday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have joined other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with themselves," she told the audience at a election organization for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about the son and other war veterans: "They come home a little different, they come home, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for their military cameras and refugees and all the other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the purpose of violence at the home of a woman, closure with a report on domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was indicted, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police in Wasilla.
18 sub-States and D.C. support testing of new asylum policies
Eight sub-States and the District of Colombia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum for victims fleeing from repeated or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 sub-States and D.C. presented an orientation from the amicus curiae (friend of the law) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the case in Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner ‘and his violent reunification sons’ abused her, but authorities in the United States rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as countries with cross-border problems with obstacles and homelessness.
In 2014, the new asylum policy in the United States revised a decision by the Court of Auditors for immigrants who provided undocumented immigrants as refugees from domestically seeking asylum.
In a statement on Friday in the District of Colombia, State lawyer Karl Racine said that the new policy "has been removed from the ten years of the state, food and international law".
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined from the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition conflicts with the principle,’ said the orientation of amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that refused immigration access is harmful to the American economy and that it is very likely that they will be motivated and "helped with the necessary labour".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing from homelessness and return in June.
‘Asyl is available for those leaving the country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion’, said the session in the notice of 11 June on policy.
Asyl was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people meet every day around the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – death rates in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was still worse.
"It was very expensive," says the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, while she comforts her febesic son at an evacation center in the city of Palu.
“All the time you see ambulances coming up.
Fresh water is scarce.’
You could see residents who came to the damaged house and easily through damaged property in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of thousands of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had a strength of 7.5, were filled.
Some of the damages, among others Dwi Haris, who broke the back and the shoulder, are outside the Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of ongoing severe seizures.
He gets tears in his eyes when he repeats how it feels when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in fifth grade he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We had no time to save ourselves.
I was cut off by the wall as fast as I could, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then it stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe."
The US Ambassador blames China for "tracassering" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after a public Chinese newspaper was running a four-person announcement in an American newspaper that welcomed the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US ambassador in China Beijing accused the US of using US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to China Daily's annex to be paid in order to enter the Des Moines Register – the most selling port in Iowa – after having accused China of attempting to interfere with the American congressional elections on 6 November, a complaint China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to influence the US election marked a new phase in Washington's climbing campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. embezzlers said Reuters.
It is normal for foreign authorities to use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked up in a evasion trade war that has led to new customs duties on imports of each other.
In the early stages of the Chinese war, the Chinese and American experts reported that exports in countries such as Iowa, supported by the Trups Republican Party, would be affected.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States of China and former multi-year governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has framed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader's install in the Des Moines Register of Sunday: "No steps up the tracking by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
“To spread this propaganda, the Chinese authorities take advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press we use in America to introduce a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“As a contrast – at the aviskios on the street here in Beijing, you do not find many conflicting views and do not experience real reflections among ordinary Chineses around China’s problem economic course, given that the media is under the dust of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “one of China’s biggest newspapers dismissed the offer to publish” his article, even if he did not disclose what it was.
The Republicans remove female voters prior to the mid-election with the Kavanaugh father, warning analysts
Since many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court, Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, who has received more complaints about sexual abuse directed against themselves, cautions analysts that they will receive a treatment, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for a FBI bordering in the last seconds will be enough to depend on sincere voters.
“Women will not forget the events of yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the "November is coming" demonstrations, while the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to continue with the appointment of Kavanaughs despite the testimony issued by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode”, said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
However, it could be higher, especially among women who are uncertain choices in the past and younger choices between 18 and 29 years, which often do not vote even if they misjudge the President.’
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which gave a detailed description of the complaints of sexual abuse against the high-right candidate, it was thought that it would be an act of opposition if the Republicans were forced through the nomination.
‘This has become a sales route for the Republican Party’ said Michael Steele, former President of the RNC (Republican National Committee), earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or its final approval or if Kavanaugh is put in place – it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group promoting democratic candidates' election to the press channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided over who they should believe in the cool water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony declarations, with a small majority for the benefit of the latter.
A new questionnaire from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were completely or quite convinced about Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced about Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38 % said that they were quite or totally convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under his witness, while only 30 % said the same about Ford.
Following the release from the Flake, the FBI is conducting an investigation into the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh was in a repentant position to lean on her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest-ranking candidate exposed his genitals to her while they were at the festival during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the head of the World Wide Web, launchs a launch to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
At Solid users can choose where their data should be stored and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee pointed out that the goal is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses the technology for Solid to let people create their own "personal data storage online" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique with the personal data store online is that it's completely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the CEO, John Bruce, that the company should set up resources, processes and relevant competences to make Solid available to all.
At present, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some introductory developers to work with the project and a re-suspend programmer.
From this week on, technology can develop around the world to create its own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don’t talk with «Facebook and Google that they should introduce something completely new or not, something that will make their business models completely recapitalated over the night.
‘We do not ask for their permission’.
In an installation on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts "the task of providing commercial energy and an ecosystem that contributes to protecting the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee translated the Internet as he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he is launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next episode of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Celebration of Victoria Corps from World War I
The only priest in the English church who was awarded a Victoria Corps during World War I as a fighter was released in his home village after 100 years.
Oberstlüntnt and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honor certificate on September 29, 1918 by the battle in Bellengle and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a skirmisher four days later and was never informed that he was assigned the highest British military mark.
A memorial was discovered by his two children at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his children, Michael Vann, said that it was a "float symbol" in which the stone would be discovered at exactly 100 years after the best price-winning.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29 – “through very thick roofs and under severe protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later, he directed the shooting line and led the line "greatly against" forward before he hit a field cannon itself and shot out three of the divisions.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German skitter on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the best man's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that made me laugh".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also dropped a crane after the parade, which was led by Corpsed Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he “felt very upset about playing a role in the parade” and added:“The battle of a real is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA trailers were up all night to see the Bellator 206, instead they got the Peppa gray
See for yourself that you've kept yourself awake all night to see the taped Bellator 206, just to discover that you don't have to see the main battle.
The participant from San Jose cleared himself through 13 battles, divided by six on the main map and was shown directly through the night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves to meet each other, the sights in the United Kingdom were about to fall when the picture suddenly showed Peppa gray.
Some were less imputed after having kept awake early in the morning to see the battle.
An associate described on Twitter the transition to the child program as “a kind of sick talk”.
"It is state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00, so they had to apply to child programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the mission.
"Pappa gray, yes!"
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work with the shipping plan to include the sights in Great Britain in the future.
"I think we can find out about it for the purpose of the fight," said Coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Faith in - when we put it over, many messages went forward and back, and they were not exactly by the friendly sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government crisis.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce from six to five – which we usually send – and we're trying to reach out to the trailers, but the tip above.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sex
The Olympic pusher Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it wasn't before he was at the youth school he realized that he was not like others.
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of the homofiles to give others “hope”.
He also said that being a parent made him less concerned about winning the OL.
The usual programme leader for the traditional Kingdom programme, Kirsty Young, shall be removed for a few months due to disease.
Daley appeared as a little removed from Lavern's first mission and said he felt "lower world" than everyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to be equal to both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day these feelings of being inferior and otherwise being the real motivation and having the strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he “was something”, he said, so that he didn’t scare everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in OL and has become a highly proficient LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at the Year's Coalitioner in Australia to appeal for a number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stood up because he felt happy that he was able to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others another “hope”.
The third time the world champion said that he was involved in a man - film company Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "overskilled me".
Daley married Oscar's friend, 20 years older than him, four years old, but he said the difference of age had never been a problem.
“When you pass so much in such a young age” – he participated in his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was necessary to find someone in the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple were parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had been changed.
"If you'd asked me in four, I wondered if I just had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there's more things than gold medallion in OL.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about whether they had received pictures to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped smoking, and it wasn't before he actually stopped smoking and was dead that I finally realized that he wasn't disproportionate," he said.
The year after Daley competed in the 2012 OL and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamt of all my life – to stand in front of a home audience under OL, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of singing - Proud by Heather Small – which meant much to him in the performance before the OL and which still gives him gas skin.
Desert Island Discs goes on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Shaped Mickelson came out to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will kill a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup game, but he has to come in shape if it's not to be a sad mileage.
Mickelson, who plays in the boninia for impressive 12 times, was placed on the bench of the camp captain Jim Furyk before the morning's four- and four-some-campers.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he had so often been for the United States, he shares the five times the major-friend day between being a hero and working with his game on the edge in hopes of fixing it as poor.
The 48-year-old had never had the best swing, even on the top of the career and is not in the perfect form of the narrow Le Golf National Ban, where the long round area still penalizes the will-farm.
And if the path itself isn't impressive enough, Michaelson, in the ninth fight on Sunday, the British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined the new starter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of the battles of theirs this corner.
If the Americans, with four points below the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game can prove to be quite decisive.
Furyk expresses trust in his husband that he could not say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a blow on my back and let the arm around me and said he would be ready next day," said Furyk.
"He has great self-confidence.
He is a "Hall of Famer" and has added so much to these layers earlier, and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games for me.
I saw for myself more, but that's how it ended, and that's what we thought we had to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will kill Nick Faldos record for most played Ryder Cup campers on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven unsecured ones, but Furyk said his participation added some immaterial values to the layer.
"He's a mother, serkastic, smart and like to run gynecologists with others. He's a great guy to have in the storage room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had the pleasure of trying against him this week too, and it was a must to see.
He gives me more than just a game.’
European General Thomas Björn knows that his great leadership will soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European Lawyer, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance to the last day's single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unfavourable round.
The Danish was debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where one side led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the race to himself the winner with the least possible margin, 141⁄2-131/2.
“You still remember yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only then," said Björn, photographed after having seen Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and last night led 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on the board that this isn't over.
You're gonna give it all tomorrow.
Come out there and do all the right things.
This is not over before you get the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophie, and that's where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are very clear about what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bjørn is very pleased with how his players have made themselves clear on the empty golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do it better.
Tomorrow's a new challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performances that are in the center, and that's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances as golf games will be tested to the full.
It's the message you have to deliver to the players that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
In contrast to Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to provide better individually than those who did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the big environments the last day, he was on the winning floor at Brooklyn before he ended up losing his life when Europe performed "miracleed at Medinah".
I remember every sentence of it," he said as an answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of law in 1999, had defeated his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you will get a good start, as we experienced at Brooklyn, as we saw at Medinah.
When the moment begins to go in one direction, it adds a great pressure on the middle of the games.
We organize our settings then and send out the people in the way we feel for. You know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to try to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player sequence.
"I count on this group of men in that order because I think it is the whole way," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship has delayed enough once
Germany's latest fleet would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the so-called war, but it will not happen until the next year because of corrupt systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the driver of the entire new frigates in the Baden-Wuertemberg class, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, according to the Di Zeit report, which cited a military number.
The vessel would have been delivered by the sea in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered the sea back in 2007, will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
They are agreed to be equipped with a strong cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ships missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to apply the latest patents for up to two years away from home.
However, steady delays mean that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be updated until they are in service, reports Die Zeit.
The F125 freeway created headlines in four, when the German marines officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss plant in Hamburg.
This was the first time the sea has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of important ‘software and hardware’ effects that made the warship unusable in a campaign order.
The software effects were particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship was to be operated by a man on about 120 seas - only half of the crew on older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge weight, which reduces its performance and limits its ability to make future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is considered to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class as were used by the Germans during World War 2.
In addition to defective machinery, the price gap has also begun to become a problem throughout the project – including human training.
It is claimed to have reached EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new fleets are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany's maritime forces are crossing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government Defence Committee, confirmed that the sea is actually ‘empty for applicable ships’.
The officer said that the problem has slowed down over time because old ships were closed, but there was no new ship.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the sea.
National Trust Suspension of the Secret Life of Flags Museums
A new research carried out at a land inheritance in the Scottish Highland shall find out how Flagermus uses the landscape in the hunting of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual flangermus and dheerglagermus, as well as the bronchos and waterflagers at Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special receivers will be placed at important locations around the property to track flag-moving activity through the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand-held detectors.
The expert's sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the Flag Mouse Groups and the species that do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural protection consultant, hopes that the results will find out which areas of the habitat that are most important to the Flags Museums and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be introduced, such as the establishment of the dairy market and the best way to take stock of the forest for flaggermus and other associated species.
The fleet population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has suffered considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects residential areas and habitat restrictions.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same as flow paper and certain chemically treated construction materials as well as domestic attacks.
Flagermus is not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting waters, they have more use for the ears than for the eyes when it comes to catching exchanges.
They use advanced ecologicalisation to find insects and obstacles on the way when they fly.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important ports and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, is very serious.
They have ten good experts regularly conducting studies, mapping of single spaces and mixed rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own flag-musement reserve at the Three Country Heritage in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 flag-museries.
Owner David Thompson says that property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a perfect area for flaggermus," he says.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there is still much we do not know about flags, so the work we do here and other property will help us to understand more about what they need to be fed."
He underlines the importance of mapping the flags before maintenance is carried out on a property, since the unsustainable destruction of one single single place can kill up to 400 dogs and young people, and perhaps exacerbating a whole local population.
Flagermus is protected, and it is illegal to kill them, drag them or disrupt them or destroy their young ones.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish co-workers for Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to help in the work.
She says: "We still have much to learn about our flags, and for many species we don't quite know how the populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects the complaints of rape while lawyers are seeking the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has described the charges of violence against himself as “false news”, saying that people “want to be praised” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to search the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's charged to pay her $375 000 in the back of the watch for the event, reported There Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the complaints were reported, 33 - year - old Ronaldo rejected the charges as “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says five times winning from the Gullballen into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm good," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to investigate The Spiegel because of the claims they have called “an unacceptable production of suspects in the private sphere”, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for “removing damage to an extent equal to the severity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious injuries to personal protection in recent years”.
The alleged event must have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After attending a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the football player's room, where he indicated he would have raped her orally, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99% of a good person” who was injured by that “one percentage”.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later she found them left outside the court because she was “free of charge” and was also concerned about ‘to remain public’.
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to put forward because she's still traumatized after the apparent event.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged invasion, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus to a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom 'will ensure forever' over the loss of image producers
United Kingdom ‘will ensure forever’ if they lose the status of world leaders in image production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was ‘severely concerned’ that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150 000 cars in four, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience the production at our factory stations," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyotas at Burnaston.
Other British producers have been concerned about leaving the EU without agreement on how trade across borders will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they will close the Mini factory at Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether the car manufacturers claim to be supply chain risks at any Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is operated on the basis of the ‘required order’ and it reaches parts every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles made on the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may remain at the border, which is said by industry to lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day storage at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and will thus stop production.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit plans for further EU relations are "presidised to avoid such border controls".
"We must have a deal. We want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only successful at the moment, but that we take this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The message, not only from Toyota but also from other image producers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that increased costs in the long term would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and after each loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A number of people from the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says The White House
Donald Trumps, who met with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, can become “only a week to” while the battle around the High-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh continued, reported the white house on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump-Meadowers and Russia, as well as possible prohibition of the exercise of justice by the President.
The question of Trump will be rejected by the Minister of Tourism or not, and thus threaten Muell's independence, has been raised during the speculations in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of withdrawing the calls with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25.
Rosenstein signed the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was announced that he was about to leave voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, would be held on Thursday.
Trump said he ‘helst would leave’ to shoot Rosenstein, but then the meeting was held to avoid it colliding with the Senate justice committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a FBI limitation for one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further issued a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, participated on Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's postponement because of all that happens with the right to high school.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up-to-date."
Some journalists will oppose the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
programmable Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the resistance to the "self-interest" of TV reporters, even though she added: "I am not inconceivable in their self-will."
Then she meant that the contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
'The President makes more questions than any previous President' said and added without giving evidence: 'We have seen the figures'.
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President directly in the United States questions, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Drump often answers questions when leaving the white house or participating in open facilities or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible reason he took a solo course and had in time a remarkable attitude before a large number of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU level as a work in Scotland's NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and a wish to be in Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applying for residence and employment permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on extradition have taken place during the summer and are expected to be settled on a solution to the harvest.
But the British Government has also taken steps to prepare for a possible scenario without agreement.
I remember this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to repeat now how high I value the effort of each of my fellow workers, regardless of nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU, and abroad, offer valuable experience and competence that strengthens and improves the work of the health service for the benefit of the patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely their home and we hope that you will be here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes a rapid operation after headset
Defenders at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, crossed the speed operation after having received a headset during the hearing day 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennesse's chief trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the side line and just picked up there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they placed him on a bar and took him back for further examination.
A staff member from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operating at the Waterbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘there is no information on the type/range of the damage yet’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a secondary student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transition from Illinois.
He had five duties on Saturday before he finished the fight, which gives in all 18 duties for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy an asset in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbin's plan to attract young voters
The issue of documents will be received by those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts in the Department of Finance expect it to increase to 120 million pounds per year – to help homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's plan to attract young voters with a promise to offer more flexible housing and high-income groups.
The document tax will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's efforts to help them cope with the situation of homeless people.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher fee imposed two years ago on housing number two and rent purchases — can be as much as 3 %.
The Department of Finance expects the measure to bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new properties in London will be purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which will increase prices and make it more difficult for first-time buyers to get the foot in the housing market.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ‘spoken cities’ due to the many foreign buyers who are mostly outside the country.
The new policy will only come weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals for a reduction in the document fee to help several young people to own their own home.
He charged large construction companies to keep the housing prices high by buying up countries without using them, and demanded Theresa May to reject quotas on reasonable housing in order to solve the "dependable housing policy" of the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an ambitious set of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unreasonably drafts.
He also wants to give the communists greater power to build new dwellings.
May said: “In the past, I said that I would devote my time as a minister of state to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as simple as it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy dwellings that are too hard to work for British citizens.
Too many people have dreamed of getting their own home away from everything, and the incredible situation of homeless people.’
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland
Sunderland's chief, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager before or after.
The 42-year-old shot rejoices at the challenge of reviving the club in the north-east, which currently holds a third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I had the pleasure of playing for my country as football players.
I got a B-cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I was often with my father and so Scotland on Hampden as a child, and there is always something that draws me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I succeeded in the club.’
Ross' supporters as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he was not guilty of following such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Successes for me will be measured at the moment if I can get the club back in Premier League”.
Out of the structure and facilities of this club, they belong to the excellent Premier League," he said.
It is not a simple task to get it from you, but I will probably just consider myself to be successful here if I get the club back to you.”
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period of time as an assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month short stay at Heart's train station.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from pressure to third division and helped St. Mirren from the edge of pressure to win the master title next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the game career at Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a good difference," he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
"I really thought that leadership was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds very good since I did well, created me a reasonable income from it and experienced some good high points.
But football games can be cool.
There are many things you have to come through on an unknown basis.
I am moving through it with regard to stress and pressure in the job, but the management feels quite right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable I have known all my adult life.”

Perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on Saturday, showing study
The summer heat waves have strengthened the incomes of Britain's hard-pressed pubs, but let more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubers and bars experienced a turnover of 2.7% in July – while the income for restaurants fell to 4.8%, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, a business consultant CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Continued sun and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as last month June, when the pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were framed more closely.
The fall of 1.8 % in the restaurant in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had a much better result, but an increase which was stronger than that restaurant went down.
Puber with food storage was also difficult with the sun, even though it wasn't as dramatic as for the racers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based powders and bars, the turnover increased by 6.6 % per month, with food retention decreased by 3 %.’.
Paul Newman, analytics from the hotel and restaurant RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The environment and major sports and social events are still the most important factors in the external market.
It will not be surprising that restaurants continue to be difficult, and a 4.8% annual-on-year turnover will be particularly painful at the top of the current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have arrived at a later date for food conservation operations, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would give a long space of dust.’
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including innovations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the warming of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry transfer controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyzes the results from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established standard of business.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One of five children – some are only 11 years old – have secret accounts on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, shows research
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren revealed pages with ‘fake Insta’.
The news has increased the concerns of sharing sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a "head account" as they show their parents.
One of five children – some are only 11 years old – create accounts on social media that they keep hidden for adults.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren detected a rapid growth in the 'fake Insta' accounts – a reference to image-sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has increased the concerns of sharing sexual content.
20% of the students said they had an innocent head account that they refer to their parents while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came over the secret side to her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “save me. ”
The research conducted by the Digital Awarens' UK and the HMC for private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s amazing that so many young people are allowed to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilyh Doyle will be the 'vote' voice of the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Governing Body of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated peace-making exercises, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the leadership to get an overview of her extensive experiences at international level over the past ten years.
"Eilih enjoys great respect for the Scottish, British and world-wide peace justice environment, and we are sure that peace enforcement officers in Scotland will benefit from getting it into the government," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am eager to act as a vote for peacemakers, and I hope I have much to contribute to leading the leadership of Scotland.”

It's been hard work, but I'm very good again and I've learned to go back, and today I'm doing smooth exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
Brochure pumps that compare mothers with who share the opinion on the network
A breast pump company has broken down the opinion on the network with an ad ad that compares the ambiguity mothers with whores that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first wireless brake pump carried against the body”, Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer goods, a fresh and flowing, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump providing active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a low-full of heights and whores to a lot of sounds, among other things: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any hell" and "In case you don't remember it, this is not a bird, it's my puppies."
The choir continues: "Pup it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the network.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it’s beautiful «grossities» in the meridian.
«Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," wrote one.
Elvie bridge pumps get good space in an amme-bü (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is obvious that both mother and baby are traumatized.
But – hey, why don’t you use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “For a failed announcement”.
Another defends the ad: a woman admitted that her song seems to be “unstinctively mammoth”.
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd have had one if I was still in charge.
The pumping got me to feel like a bitch.
The announcement is a little bit of a joke, but I took it for what it was.
This is a great product," it was one written.
Another commented: “This is a mother's anonymity directed against mothers as pumpers (or at work or toilets) and feels like ‘kour’.
This is not an ad that covers or condemns the meeribrane.’
At the end of the video, the women discover that they have all danced with the discré pump in the b-en.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump themselves, say they feel like dogs.
However, the Elvie pump is quite styling, there are no guides or snakes and get a nice place in an amme-bow, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and go out while the pumps.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother’s mother, commented: “Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a sweet and tempting launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milkers, we wanted to set out searchlights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while we consistently and consistently demonstrate the incredible feeling of freedom of the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a baby-sitting woman appeared on the catwalk for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a teller at the Texas border in all secrets
The number of migrant children detained has increased even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because heavy rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration has made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most of the supporters have even been undocumented immigrants, and have been prepared to destroy their own chances of being in the country by bringing up and making demands on a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to impose fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an overarching minister of immigration and customs authorities, witnessed to the Congress that the Agency had arrested thousands of persons seeking to be supporters of individual minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 % of the arrestees had no previous criminal roll sheet.
‘Nearly 80 % of the persons who are either a support player or a member of the family of a support player are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to follow these people," says Albence.
The officials are trying to address the children faster and introduced new rules suggesting that some of them must meet in court within one month of being detained, and not 60 days of the previous standard, according to the recipients.
Many will be produced through a video conference instead of meeting personally in order to conduct their case on residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those considered inappropriate asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain on the label, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or sleepless trials, according to the reception workers and reports that have occurred in the last few months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown through a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who are slightly reduced are translated because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the computer without having enough time to prepare emotionally or take color with friends can strengthen dreams like many already broken.
Syria requests US, French and Turkish occupation powers to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now within its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Minister of State of the Interior, said that the foreign forces were illegal in Syrian territory under the cover of the fight against terrorism and 'will be dealt with afterwards'.
‘They must move out immediately and unconditionally,’ he said to the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that the ‘war against terror so as to say above’ in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been around since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said that Damascus would continue to “keep this sacred struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” both for terrorist groups and for “all foreign presence”.
The United States has approximately 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
In the case of flights, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he complained ‘see Western countries’ in order to ‘over irrational flights’ that will allow the flights to stay away.
"We have referred to the international community and humanitarian organizations to arrange for these returns," he said.
They policy what is really a purely humanitarian situation.’
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defense of opponents at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkey Agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moulalem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clearer deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against Jihadists, including warlords from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, who ‘will be eliminated’.
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to establish a post-war law for Syria and the road to new elections.
Moulalem submitted the conditions for the participation of the Syrian authorities in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘transition of the articles of the current basic law’ and alert against mixing.

Money outside flows into the regular intervals of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a stream of money after the conversion of a convention district that concluded that two seats are fighting the same seat.
This newly established urban district in Pittsburg is situated with democratic representative Conor Lamb – who has been seen in another district in a four-year supplementary election.
Lamb stands against another seated representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which is high in the 17th district.
The map was re-arranged after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a fundamentally conflicting manipulation of the electoral circuits in the interests of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosion of campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button sails in a densely followed supplemental option for Pennsylvania 18 district to the Congress in March.
It had been held by a republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
USA Assessed Criminal Action against El Salvador for Support to China, followed by the threat
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama entirely for the partners cast out the management team for the Trump Organization.
Employers in the Foreign Department decided to call back the American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a member of the department's number, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the measures were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, covered by economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high labour and loss rate.
In the course of internal meetings, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection in four which was assessed as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from arriving in the United States.
However, in mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the Conference to continue, as had stopped all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now ready to speak to the conference, which is now planned in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration's addition to the collection, the diplomat said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new empty messages or criminal action from Washington.
A speaker at the White House of Bolton decided to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, namely two diplomats, who were involved in discussing the internal considerations under the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst attached to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From Histories
The next speaker in the box may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to justice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also indicated at the end of extending the review to whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia in the integration of our elections.
If the Congress would change its side, Trump would be held responsible for the body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his fellowmen.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not think that the fall of Trump is inevitable – and not for its counter-attacks in Europe.
There must be a choice for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean that will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938 the Germans were able to make a coup against Hitler, if only the west had stood against him and supported the checklaws at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points, and democracy's voluntary march is accelerated or restored.
The Americans are facing several of these points now.
What will we do if Trump packs Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been very close since this report announced that he had in the first place proposed secret resignations by the President and had been speculating that he was not qualified to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is wrong.
“How will we react if the recent FBI border of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is admitted to high-level in spite of credible overcrowding charges and dishonest witnesses?
And above all, will we vote under the Inter-Agency Committee for a Congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we do not understand the tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me away to wear soap on the table with the jacket.
With such an inheritance, how can I be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will take up Rapid Vienna on Thursday, of course, to sail over the eastern states after the impressive fighting in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A chained interband player Graham Dorrans to make his first act for the season in the fight 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a jump board to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good law," said the 31st year.
"We went into the game and thought we could get something and get a point with us.
Maybe we could've knocked in at the end, but it wasn't fair enough.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round, and it was the best thing to do.
On Thursday, there will be a great evening in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they have a good outcome in the last battle, but with the home audience in the back I am sure we can stand up and get a positive result.
The previous year was absolutely quiet, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but it is a good feeling now.
The layer's good and good hair; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand up now, add the previous season behind us and get it.’
Women lose the night's sleep due to the fear of pension saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear explanation of how they wanted to be dealt with, there were few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the National Wide Study said they spoke with the etiquette about the costs of long-term play.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want to be handy about someone in the family, but they don't do anything to take the call," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Insurance Office.
That's what you're gonna do.
Talk to the children and the children: You can't prepare the family to give you pleasure if you don't say what you want in advance.

Include your financial adviser: The consultant can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
The long-term payment options may include a traditional long-term pay insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash to help cover these expenses or self-sustainment with your own assets – if you have enough money.

A man shot several times with an Air Force in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air conditioning when he was on his way home after an accident.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Politicians described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an ‘imposed action’.
The victim wasn't the victim.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have left witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a mighty earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the officials, and death rates are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donghea accounts, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the earth’s surface with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster hit.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donghea on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay overlooking the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The town enjoyed 40-year-old jubilee when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donghea is a county that extends more than 300 km along the coastal border in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The accounts, an administrative region at provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the characteristics of the central province of Sulawesis's economy, in particular the coastal region Donghea.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, at the coast opposite of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodangaa have been framed by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency aid administration.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghea.
A tsunami also struck the west Donghea in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is situated on the seismic Ildrigen in the Pacific and is regularly covered by land mines.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Akeh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes covered the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a strength of 6.8 hits south of Java, Indonesia's most popular eye and dissolved a tsunami that opened the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: A 7.6 strong earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake with a force of 7.5 framed one of the Mentawai-eyes, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres as the explosion of thousands of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A huge earthquake framed by the Pidie Jaya account in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the wars of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There were no tsunamis this time, but over 100 were killed by random buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake strikes Indonesia's tourists Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and resulted in thousands of tourists being temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's last son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for overcrowding charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, closure with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Dutch sub-state police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a woman known when she tried to call the police to report the alleged infringement.
Palin will be arrested in Mat-Su security prison and arrested for an unsecured debt letter worth 500 dollars, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he dealt with the matter, reported the network.
Palin is faced with three tests of Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged for a class B rape, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time it's presented a view against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged crash.
The case will be brought to Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was targeted for domestic violence, closure with the report on domestic violence and to hold a gun while he was involved in the incident.
His girlfriend swore to him to shoot her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterinary groups in 2016 after she linked the child’s violent behaviour to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake wiped out a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications network are below and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The ground floor is the same as central Sulawesi, which lies north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the outbreak.
More than a hundred people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu where the tsunamis feed on the beach.
Federal opposition authorities rarely apply for the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal authorities in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a food crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, apparently used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he met footmen and cyclers on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the contracting authority must prove that Saipov had killed the eight victims “simply” and caused serious body damage with a view to seeking the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a food-producing 22-point count was reduced, including eight deaths in connection with money-pressure, in the eyes of Saipov, usually used by federation authorities in cases of organised crime, and a vehicle-based approach to violence and smoking.
The attack called for "a significant planning and advance", said the actor, who described how Saipov carried out it as a "greed, rough and required".
‘Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco’, the caution is set.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York was leading a death penalty.
It was said that Khalid Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug addicts, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, an exeparate who was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out a spying for the Soviet Union during the so-called war two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple was held in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the researchers that he was happy for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after having seen ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the view.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag on the hospital room, the police said.
He did not declare himself guilty after the statement of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the public defenders of Saipov, said they were ‘openly framed’ over the decision of the opposition authority.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting an admission and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the opposition authorities not to seek a death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL Farage should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage agreed to "mobilise the army of the people" today during a demonstration during the Tory Conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that the politicians would get "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptors – as one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he should be responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would “have been expelled” now if Farage was a Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge of May by ensueing its deeply broken rivers has been stressed by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a self-removing demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Ministry of State is fighting to keep its Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the withdrawal – and forced Eurosceptors and Labor to choose between her package and ‘kaos’.
Bones told "Exchange means the demonstration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit Plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit Plan".
When he would explain his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to become subjective.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Both claim that the referendum had changed since the vote in 2016: "The claim that the British people have changed their mind and wish to remain in the EU is completely wrong".
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I say very simply: Minister of State, listen to the people.
"The Brexit plan is unpopular to the public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopulated in the party and in our activists, who are actually the ones who track the streets and get us elected for the first time.
Reject the Brexit plan and start listening.’
In a direct message to May, she added: ‘The Minister of State keeps the job when they keep their promises’.
Farage said that the politicians would have “feel the pressure” if they were to advise the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and the politicians," he said.
“They are trying to persuade Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to feel the pressure of our politicians, who are on the wheel to advise Brexit.
We mobilize people's armies in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest before we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom.'
In the midst of the march, Remainers passed through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political assembly in the center of the city.
A small number of activists gathered with Tories Against Brexit runners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis seized the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems on the ground and all the technology for Canada plus, for a free limit, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete step.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously assesses the position of presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "take it seriously as presidential candidate" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the democracy from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a Council meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.

The event afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the board format since Trump was president.

arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting season that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They release a video of the shooting on Friday and ask for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a year of shock and death due to it," said police officer Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde went in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was heard and admitted that he was on the spot and had the gun with him, and he admitted to shoot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without arrest and placed in a trademark at the East Baton Rouge Parish politician.
Sims was a two-metre tall young man who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims to win the world title after starlords give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stalwarts would play a great role in the course.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and fever near Hamilton of the road while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his camera.
The valve ran into the warehouse first and let Hamilton continue to run in the back part of the main field, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pist stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ran up after some swiping with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly locked the inside free after a double pass to defend himself in third swing.
Max Verstappen started from behind row of the field and entered as item seven at the end of the first round of its 21st year of life.
Then he led in large parts of the course as he lay on the wheels to try to get a quick conclusion and overcome Kimi Raikkonen as he lay as number four.
He came to the end within the warehouse on the 44th round, but it was not possible to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkon took a fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a wonderful job all weekend and was a good gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a wonderful job to get a good job," Hamilton said.
It was a pretty bad body language.
President Donald Trump held Senator Diane Feinstein under a political hearing on the day of her arrest for not taking the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
When the President spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's witnesses before the Senate's judicial committee, he commented instead that what happened in the Senate shows that people are “simply, passionate and unsound.”
"The only thing that could happen and the pleasant thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are sensitive and ashamed and talk nonsense," he said.
"When you look at the fruits and the vegetables, they will say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I have not done so.»
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you been married?
You remember her answer... you took the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not fallen.»
Hey, wait a minute.
We played... no, we didn't do it," he added, with a comparison of the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent with detailed information on the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was released earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't tell her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked me to.”
But her relationship was not reached by the president, who, during the hearing on Saturday evening, commented: "I must say something to you, it was a pretty bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defence of the High Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President stated that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw the power with all necessary means.
You see the ghastly, the evil, they don't care who they are, who they have to go through to get power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two goals for Giant against Dundee
Dundee Stars made for Friday's Elite League battle against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return battle in Dundee on Saturday.
Before long, Giant received a two-dimensional command through a shot from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were represented for the housekeeper before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compared to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the winner.
It was the third Elite League trap for the season for Adam Keef's men, who had come back after they shot Dundee 2-1 at Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the layers, and Giant had won the three previous battles.
Twoy's opening came in four minutes at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford left the game when Beauvilleer doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan took the house back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt left to Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giant had the lead at break when he took his second goal for the night at the end of the first round.
The housewife regrouped and Bouchard compared enough once with a measurable goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give the lead for the first time during the battle late in another round, and he assured the winner with the team's five half-way out at the end.
Giants, who has now lost four of the last five battles, plays home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Flight leaders die to ensure that hundreds of passengers escape land mines
A pilot in Indonesia is buried as completely after he died and ensured that a flight that had hundreds of passengers could safely take away.
More than 800 people have arrived, and many have been disappointed after a mighty earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful shells continue to terrorize the area, and many have been captured in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strong Swiss control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He was going to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the route right then, could safely be easy.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died in a hospital later.
A speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We cleared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were touched when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll can reach several thousand, and the disaster preparedness body of the country reports that there is limited access to the cities of Dongdraa, Sigi and Boutong.
"The numbers are expected to rise further since many equal numbers have been caught during the ruins and many have not been able to reach," said the organ speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have raced Palu, who will keep a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances coming up.
It's a lack of clean water.
The minimum markets will be affected everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indoneish Red Cors works February to help survive, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the military of the country: "I ask all of you to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you all right?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes last year in Lombok, where over 550 people were killed.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after flying crash in the waves
The airline, who owned the plane that crashed in a lake in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the flying plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was one of the men they had not looked at.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the people after the plane hit the water while they tried to land on the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The servants said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said that the flight in the garage was like outside the train.
Some witnesses thought the plane was bombed on the road.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to navigate through medium-distance water to the emergency exit on the visible plane.
He said that the planes had panic and screamed, and that he had a lower head injury.
U.S. Navy told seafarers who worked near to repair a bridge also helped in the rescue work by using a floating boat to unload people in the country before flying around 30 metres below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been hit by PNG-registered flights in the last two years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyticals forward the time line for the night a woman was burned alive
The authorities concluded the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi living in 2014.
USA Analysts in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert in field tracking analysis.
He described to the judge how he used mobile prints to push the movements to 29 years old, Quinton Tellis said and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, that night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several mobiles that showed Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, something contrary to what he had raised earlier, reported The Clarion Ledge.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the cell phone to Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police drove to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the testimony box on Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When an actor asked about Tellis speaking the truth when he assumed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he “sold because my trailer was in Nashville”.
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis raised him to know Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints indicate that they only knew each other in one week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, he deleted Tellis' calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He removed her from her life," said Hale.
The defence shall begin its proceedings on Sunday following the plan.
The judge said he expected the case to be transferred to the jury later that day.

The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origin with political message to raise social issues.

Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new flowering in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Children's passports in New York are seeking a divorce after a "risistic" message
A child passenger in New York requests a couple of discriminatory objections after receiving a wrong message from the mother, who complained that she was “another black person”.
The party rejects them as racist and compares the application with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a toddler, expressed excitement when she found out that the new child passenger, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for the first working day in 2016.
«NEEEEEIII AND SVART PERSON» wrote to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After discovering the loss, it was a 'consolable' plastic-Flaxman who said up to Maurice, claiming that their alleged child passenger, who was African, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice asks for compensation for the claim and requires compensation in order of size $350 per day for the six months long, the dissolved scheme she was promised, but without contract.
"I wanted to show them that – hey, that's not what you do," she said to New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have turned their back on the charges that they are racist and say that Maurice's claim was the only one right, since they didn't feel they could trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come again.’
The comparison of the "expressing" application to the "expressing" was due to his wife having only two months to term and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Is it such a person you want to punish?
It is not particularly pen» added the share mesh.
As the legal case goes on, the public court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Leaving Paddington afraid that readers would not accept a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in another place when they read it for the first time before it was released.
It is very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success.”
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the book of a small boat, would have been very pleased that his work had been canceled. She added that the 60-year-old debt for the book delivery was "biter suit" after he left.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of the family” and adds that her father secretly was very proud of his success.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was no scared person," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who makes a gift: you are proud of it even if it is not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little like that.
Even though it was his product and his fantasy, he always wanted to give the honor to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say color over the phone
On landing, the daughter was rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctor's job was left to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was so bad that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I got the phone from Nad who said she came to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The doctor had given her the heart to fight, lost its effect, and left the system.
She died an hour earlier and the organs in the body were caught together.
I just had to sit there and wait, of course it happened.
I couldn't sleep and cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now cared for the loss of the daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the tests she passed.
"No idea," she says.
“I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a strange stream.
It's hard to explain, but there was on the plane I felt this overwhelming feeling for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with caring women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their girlfriends in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up mail cards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging message and phone numbers can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was framed by depression and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a devastating smile.
"Everyone knew him in the smile.
They said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped at work before he died because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother to Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I worry about it all the time for it to be an infection effect".
Sharon put the cards "to tell people there are people out there who can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit down for yourself - you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt down or depressed or something," she says.
"A few days before July let's note the amended vote.
On 1 July he was completely in the cellar – when the young people opened the Christmas, they didn’t get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great tragedy for them, but they must fight through it: “It smells a big hole in the family.
We're in pieces.
But we all have to hold out and fight."

Brett Kavanaughs' future lies in a thin thread while the FBI is starting research
"I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time-limited and extensive review – we could perhaps come to a certain agreement," Fleke said on Saturday, and let him fear that the Committee would 'fall apart' along the set party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to examine?
The protest was due to be lifted.
The inter-elections are only five weeks away on 6 November – if the Republicans are likely to make it bad, it will be significantly more difficult for them to get the man they want to choose to the highest law in the country.
George W. Bush has called around senators and driven lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, as the work in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley where she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unknown whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that vice-president Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him placed in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean diggers under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-Seug, referring to data from South Korea's collection department, said it had been 1127 rounds – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices in human mirror were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on the public.
Most refugees from North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly popular demilitarized zone between the two Korean States.
China considers the victims to be illegal migrants and not refugees and return them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South – which is technically still in war – has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to discuss the established negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, handed down the United States sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will be resolved individually first," said Ri in a talk to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unable to sit in the top right
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hissterical” and said he had a temperature that made him unable to sit in the High Court.
Pelosi came with the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman had acted like this, she would have been called hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh acknowledged the feeling that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Because they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very sensitive in his opening statement, secretly nearly cried and was crying when he spoke about the family and the years of the day.
He was also strongly condemned against the Democrats of the Committee and called him a 'great and coordinated character drama' organised by liberals who felt that Hillary Clinton had killed the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not sit in the high court since it showed that he was opposed to democracies.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such opinions and how he attacks Clinton's party and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi wanted when she was asked if she would try to establish Kavanaugh for the right if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority of the House of Representatives.
"I want to say this – if he does not tell the truth to the Congress and the FBI, he is not only unable to sit in the highest court, but also in the right he is currently sitting," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a democracy, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he was considered a conservative judge.
In the inquiry, Mr Kavanaugh asked whether he would examine certain high court decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, pacific person to the top and expect us to appeal to it," said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair winter, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're calm," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so rare, do you?"
She continues: “I received good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was in bed, but had developed a technique that meant that when she felt and started crying, she said to the person she spoke to «You think I might be sad because I cry.
I'm a son."
And then she just continued.
And it seemed to me that I was fantastic."
Tears are allowed as a result of a severe part of the effects of their fundamental misunderstanding.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was at a man-dominated office. I started to cry with an unexplained racer and was caught in the back of an old woman's neck – a cool boss that I had always been a little upset about – who threw me into a trapperum.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
“They don’t know you’re racist.
They will believe that you are happy and satisfied because they are ready to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was released to be exonerated against the incident on board a boat like the Monkey Business and pulled away from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of standing as presidential candidate himself.
"It was not a comprehensive decision," she said with a late 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was one more.
Some called it "Snöh White and the seven dvergers".
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and swore that she wouldn't settle if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get fired, or?" she wonders.
When she held the talk to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to manage money and reach the election instead of delegates, and thinking about sex - that she fell into tears.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls about how the press spoke about her.
"You should believe that Klenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking about my faith what they would write on my grave support?
'She's crying?'
How the U.S. Trade Wars Can Win Beijing
The openings of the US-China trade war were on the rise, and even though the struggle was far from over, a call between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, rejected the first warning earlier this year by adding customs on important Chinese exports, particularly solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week's most important escalation took place with new customs duties on goods worth 200 billion dollars, which means customs on half of all goods imported into the United States of China.
Beijing has, of course, been rewarded every time, at least at the latest with a five to ten per cent increase in US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match US attacks for attacks, and the world's next largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to hit down means giving up on requirements, but public sub-question against the United States will be too impressive for the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the US trade war can give a positive message for China for a long time by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that are beginning to affect the economy in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the grants have earlier been introduced," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thought-making.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to return to the country, which has been raced for more than 7 years with war.
When he spoke at the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and certainly thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The State continues to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have been taken in their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country, who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would take good care of helping to rebuild the damaged country.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the disturbance.
