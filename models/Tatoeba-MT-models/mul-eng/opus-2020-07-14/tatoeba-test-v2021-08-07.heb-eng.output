I've got new recipes.
I have to do this to my parents that I've been able to finish high school.
I need him to succeed.
I've got to get the help I got from him.
I must have made it to my friends.
I need you a beer.
I paid two dollars a month.
I paid for the power in cash.
I paid him four dollars.
I mean, I've got a job at the Livy Station.
I betrayed Jess.
I'm guilty.
I fucked my shoes for you.
I'd rather that way.
I prefer that dress on this face.
I'd rather plan my activities on a regular basis, so that I can work out with time.
I'd rather rest in the morning.
I showed myself at a meeting.
I promised myself I wouldn't marry anymore.
I promised to wait.
I promised to read the news.
I promised.
I promise I will protect you.
I'm alive.
I pressed on the key to press the radio.
I'm going to play in the ears every time I hang out with my group at that club.
I added Tom's name to the list.
Eggs is a good guy.
I wanted as fast as possible.
I got to the station at 6:00.
I got to the mountain stop in five hours, right?
I read in the newspaper that she was murdered.
I'm calling the interview.
I'm reading the old documents.
I appreciate the fact that you think of me this way.
I really loved you.
I really miss my friend.
I really need to see Tom.
I really need your help.
I'm really sorry about what I did.
I really wanted this job.
I really want to wake up.
I really wanted to go with you, but I didn't.
I totally refused.
I refuse to betray you!
I'm sorry I went there.
I'm sorry I told you.
I'm back.
I remember that.
I remember how I went home last day in a small car.
Remember that I remembered it once or twice.
I ordered John to leave immediately.
I'm getting out of your pocket.
I'm getting rid of your shirt.
I've lost you.
I changed my theory.
Brassal's hard.
The bridge is the bridge that most use it.
I woke up outside to see what was going on.
I woke up.
Newton's play was English physics.
I said no.
I said something.
I said it's gonna happen.
Is there any more exchanges in the market?
I saw a sign today.
I saw a woman in black.
I saw everything.
I met her just a week ago.
I saw her driving in the park.
I saw him again.
I saw him kicking the car.
I didn't see anyone around.
I didn't see anything.
I saw the movie.
I saw the roof crying.
I saw Tom from Pellett with my wife.
I saw Tom hiding his money.
Sometimes I think so.
Is eating less in meat a good idea?
I see a book on the desk.
I'm seeing Sikki Dinor!
I see Tom almost too much of his day.
I see where it's going.
I see you've done a good job.
I'm gonna catch yosema and drop the moment for my good.
I'm afraid I see him.
Talkin' in English?
I've sent you a D.A.
Everybody all right?
Everything okay?
Everything there?
I'll leave the school.
I'm with his political ideas.
Is he interested in me or something?
Is he really coming?
Is his father a doctor?
I'm done.
I have to come too.
I have to run.
I shouldn't have said that.
I shouldn't have trusted you.
I shouldn't have asked Tom's verdict.
I should've stayed longer.
I'm stuck in my pocket.
I'm Sarah.
Five o'clock, how's the time?
Does that have any power?
Is that serious?
Is that true?
Is that far?
Is it far from here?
It's hard to learn Greek?
Could I even have a chance with Tom?
Can we get there on the way?
Is it raining?
Is that red?
Is it safe to drink who's hot here?
Is it safe to eat it?
Is it true that you're serious that I believe this?
Is that right?
I missed one line in the book.
I slept all day, because it was the first day.
I slept late.
My dress is straight?
I'm getting tired all the time.
I'm tired.
Isn't that crazy?
Isn't life wonderful?
Isn't that theirs?
I smell sometimes.
Sometimes you hurt my butt.
Sometimes I use books as a boxer.
I understand.
I'd like to take you with me to the sea.
I speak Spanish.
I'm happy with the history of my day.
I cleaned the house all day.
I spent the whole day in jail.
I spent hours reading books.
I went home the last day.
I spent the whole day on the beach.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
I spent my reading time yesterday instead of going out.
I made coffee on the table floor.
I talked too early.
I talked to him about a mental problem.
I threw Flyt out of the car.
I've placed my bet.
The country of Israel is a "democratic" Jewish liberal.
Is she really that beautiful?
Is there anyone here?
I started stealing.
I started to respect Tom.
I'm staying at home the first day.
I stayed calm.
I stayed at home all day and read books.
I stayed up all night.
Do you think tens of thousands are going to die?
I've been warning about the smoke.
Is that a threat?
Is this back up to West And?
Is that what happened to her?
Is that what the government wants?
Is that what you came to ask me?
Is that your sister?
Did the field movement go crazy?
Is this a big job for you?
You're a good teacher?
Is there a tape on the table?
Is there a connection between blood transfusion?
Is there an English-Yepani script on the tape?
Is there a thing today for me?
Do you have any idea what this is about?
Is there anything else I need to know?
Is there something you can do now?
Is there anything you want?
Is there a movie store in the hotel?
Is there a store there?
Is there a time table?
Is there a camp room for young people around here?
The bar is deep?
Is that a dream?
Is that a player?
Is that Candy's money?
Is that fake?
Is that a good English?
Is that our hotel?
That's your ex-wife?
Is this box open?
Is that serious?
Is that the key you're looking for?
Is this the place where the accident was bad?
Is that the right way to say it?
Is that your bank?
I still have headaches.
Not yet in my decision.
You're still missing me.
I'm still sorry you won't win.
I still think you're hiding something.
Five-five?
Do you think he's acting like a bitch?
Cold war?
You hungry?
Do you agree with that?
- You sure about that?
- You're in the middle of the night?
I learned very hard.
I suggest you send him a letter of thanks.
I suggest you put the gun down.
I guess I'll have to be more careful in the future.
I guess that's it.
I really hit your ass in the ass.
I thought so.
I'm afraid Sam's not preparing his own school.
I guess you already know that.
I'm afraid you won't like it.
I'm afraid they're putting the beer in her pocket.
I'm offering opportunities.
Is your house away from your apartment?
Your mom at home?
Does your new computer work well?
Is your room cold?
Your room cold?
Your wife's still in B?
Every night I'm doing an ammo.
I'll be back.
I'm sending my hair in front of him because of the hard work.
I talked to everybody.
Looks like he's wrong.
It's probably a wedding.
I liked the wine.
It turned out to be more.
It bothers me.
It could be fatal.
It's the future of being a hero.
He can't be busy.
It can get anywhere.
It could happen.
It scares me like a bet.
It's definitely a good feeling.
It depends how you deal with it.
Depends on the connection.
It won't last more than three minutes.
It didn't make me think.
It didn't even happen to me.
It didn't go that far.
It won't last more than three minutes.
It took some time to relax.
It won't bother us if you take a picture outside.
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
Don't pay to play video games.
It doesn't sound like you want my help.
It doesn't seem to matter.
It doesn't sound like it.
It takes a lot of time.
It really sounds funny.
I'm a Dutch student.
I'm willing to agree with you.
It feels great.
It feels right.
That's so good.
There's a lot of prejudice here.
I was going to sign up for him.
I went to Tom about the time he was a priest.
I'm going to take a look at you, and I'm going to have to get you to work. I'm gonna be able to do it.
It happened here.
It happened today.
Turns out it's true.
We'll be much hotter.
It's going to rain more than three hours.
It's been raining since the first day.
It doesn't matter.
It's a break.
There's too much inconsistency.
It helps.
I think about you every time I beat my teeth.
I think he's eating something like ten pieces.
I'm sorry he's right.
I'm sure he's still right.
I think he knew that.
I think he's coming.
I'm sure he can.
I think he's fucked up.
I think he's right.
I think his idea is very important.
I think formal speech is the most difficult part in the future.
I think it's good I'll help you.
I think I'm going back to Dayta after the party.
I think I just heard someone.
I think she's good to me.
I think I still love you.
I think I'll stay inside today.
I think I'll stay at home today.
I think I'm going to Boston next summer.
I think everything's fine.
I think we should try.
I don't think that's the best way.
I think it's time that Adsex had the problem with her.
I think it's time for me to make my homework.
I think it's time I started doing my homework.
I think it was pretty impressive.
I think I'm gonna have another gliding party.
I think a lot of people do that.
I believe my friends are giving me cancers.
I think she's a good dancer.
I think she's sick.
I think she's too young.
I think that's what it is.
I think that's what you need to worry about now.
I think you're an atom.
I think that's gonna be great.
I think you're right.
I think the plan was perfect.
I think they're in some kind of trouble.
I think it's about who's resting.
I'm so sorry, he's not moving.
I think it's a big mistake.
I think that's the only way to get rid of mucks.
I think it's been a lot of luck.
I think there's three lights.
I think you're doing the best you can.
I think it's cool.
I think you're welcome.
I think you're a very good soldier.
I think that's a move.
I think Tom should have been here.
I think a cold was compatible with me.
I don't think it's enough for two cups.
I think we can move it.
I think we can help this out.
I think we can.
I think we had a good year.
I think we need a break.
I think we have to apologize.
I think we're having a very good time.
I think we should go with you.
I think you're wrong.
I'm sorry you made a mistake.
I don't think you did that.
I think you should be more sensitive.
I think you're in my pocket.
I think you're just a friend.
I think you're just wasting your time.
I think you're taking it a little too hard.
I think you should drink some coffee.
I don't think you should have done this.
I'm sorry you didn't have to do that.
I thought you should tell your parents we were getting married.
I enjoyed it very much.
I thought college would be an interesting place.
I thought I could handle it myself, but I was wrong.
I thought I'd surprise Mary and invite her to dinner.
I thought I paid the monthly salary, but I got a phone call from the school, and they told me that the payoff was not yet.
I thought it was a good book, but Jim thought another one.
I thought everything was over.
I thought it was really bad.
I thought it was very good.
I thought it'd be nice to live in Boston for a year or two.
I thought maybe no one else would agree with me.
I thought you were rocking.
I thought Sam did it pretty well.
I thought you'd get a shot.
I thought you saw me.
I thought you were in danger.
I thought Tom would keep this part going.
I thought we already opened it.
I thought we were here to talk about Tom.
I thought you were always winning.
I thought you loved Tom.
I thought you'd lose.
I thought you lost the watch.
I thought maybe you'd like a breakfast early.
I thought you might want to watch this.
I thought your concert was successful yesterday.
I thought you said you didn't know what to do.
I thought you were working.
I thought you were working.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were my friend.
A sad job is that while people drive a car in some countries, they drive at least a lot of food at home and in restaurants.
Without face and manner, it's not easy to want everyone.
It's been a year.
It's yellow, but on the other hand it's not good.
Sure what to do.
It's wise to go.
It's the end he's going to America.
I don't know if he's prepared his own homework.
It's stupid to wonder what you can't move.
You're out of your mind now.
It's hard for me to sleep.
It's hard to say what a nicer car is.
It's important to help it.
It's hard for a child to grow up not to move for an hour.
It might be part of a tree.
Of course you're crazy.
Not cold today.
It's not easy for him to learn English.
It's not true that both parents tried to find their children.
He doesn't want you to drink, but she does.
It's not always hot.
Today's not hot either.
It's not such a long flight.
It's not a hairy or a few years old, they're doing the "old"; a man is old when he loses his sense of humor and we don't care about anything anymore.
It's not worth it.
Otherwise it's true.
We have a duty to apply the law.
Of course she's gonna turn on you.
It's pretty cold again today, but tomorrow the temperature's expected to rise.
There is a clear indication for black people to visit in hospitals, in books, in theaters, in colleges, in hotels and in restaurants, for the disabled.
It's over there.
From their students' duty to clean up their bodies.
The time has come for you to abandon your childhood behavior.
It's time you told her the truth.
It's too good to be true.
I'm sorry, that's right.
To argue with him that's what it's like.
The feeling is that it's the right thing.
That doesn't make sense.
It doesn't do anything.
It just looks stupid.
He's alive in the kitchen.
It'll be good for everyone.
I'll find it hard to beat you.
It'll be three months until the house is completed.
About three o'clock.
It'll work, for sure.
It looks like Terry.
It looks good.
It looks like a bear.
It looks like rain.
Looks like you've got a sense of saying good-bye.
It doesn't seem to be sitting.
That's what made me lose my temper.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's all a fucking misunderstanding.
That doesn't make any sense.
Now that's the point.
Maybe it's true.
Can help you look at the problem from a different point of view.
Maybe it's not in your nature, but at least you'll be a little welcome.
It may not be necessary for you to do this, but I think you need it.
You might drop the rain tonight.
It might look weird.
It could help.
It could work in the future.
Tomorrow might blow the rain.
Maybe it's a bad night.
It must be a birthday cake!
We need a perfect symmetry here.
I told him, but he didn't understand.
I told him that, but he didn't understand.
I didn't tell him anything.
I didn't tell him anything.
I told him to come.
I told him to come.
I told my memory to cancel all my meetings.
I told them it was urgent.
I told them I'd help you.
I told him I had to leave early.
I told him I was from Boston.
I told you not to tell you.
I told you I don't want to go.
I told you I'd give it to you.
I told you it wouldn't happen so much.
I told you I'd help you.
I told you they were missing.
I told you that Sam was hungry.
I told you to shut up.
I told you to love Tom.
It's just running on windows.
I took a day off.
I took pain in my head.
I'm tired.
I was driving.
I took care of it.
I took care of Tom's cat.
I thought he was the man.
I've been dealing with it, of course, with him you'll join.
I took it from him, of course.
I washed my hair and went into church.
I'm afraid I've taken the train by the side.
I filmed it a week ago.
I took the kids to school.
I broke a blessing order and I needed a cure.
It's going to be so strong that we decided to visit him for another purpose.
It's raining yesterday.
I went to Tokyo to see Tony.
I tried to convince her, but I tried to convince her.
I tried not to do that.
I tried not to eat too much.
I tried to avoid him a few more.
I tried to be calm.
I was trying to prepare my homework, but I didn't know how, so I got pregnant.
I've been trying to move this out of my mind.
I tried to tell you that.
I tried to write it to him.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I'm sorry about the sight.
I put faith in them.
I trust you on the roof like everyone else.
It's five.
It's a very good shot.
It's a big dog.
That's right.
It's a party.
It's a shock.
It's a Koder place.
It's a great little car.
It's a big story.
It's starting to be meaningful.
It's been a long night.
It's already 7.
It's a bad job.
It's a matter of personal taste.
It's magic!
It's a nice bed to relax.
It's true you hurt us, but the surveillance in a movie reopens my mind from the danger before they're in the world.
It's a taster.
It's a letter from a book.
It's a joke.
I used to thank you for that.
It's a tough day.
That's a word I wanted to change.
That's a word I was interested in finding a change.
It's not like listening to voices when you eat Mark.
Well, we don't have the prize bar.
It's good you don't take foreign cookies.
That doesn't really make sense.
It's completely natural.
It's dangerous to jump into the water.
It's dangerous to perform this acrobatic habit without a safety list.
It's dangerous to learn.
It's dangerous to sleep at night.
It's definitely worth a check.
It's disgusting.
It's early.
It's more than it looks.
It looks hard.
Looks like he's still alive.
It's like he's never met his father yet.
Looks like he's very busy today.
It seems that the battle between Microscopt will never end.
It's food.
It's about to happen soon.
Good to see you all again.
It's hard for me to get out of my mess.
It's hard to tell them no.
That's what motivates me.
It's a housework.
It's important not to go out and leave the bed in the shower.
It's important that universities have a serious operation with local communities.
It's important to read books.
It's in a restaurant at 42th Street.
It's just the tension.
It's just a choice of a face-to-face friendship.
The temperature's only 10 degrees, and he's going outside the T.T.'s making me cold just looking at him.
It's pretty bright.
It's just like fighting for spiritual security.
It's like giving Dracola responsibility for the blood bank.
Today looks like a severe test.
It's time for tomorrow.
It smells good!
I don't want to share it with anyone!
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
It's morning.
It's my duty to help you.
I'm ready for bed.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
Please give me a ride.
It's not a big deal, you know.
I don't care!
It's not Bug.
It's not a big surprise.
It's not the hope.
It's not a mistake.
It's not a funny picture.
It's not funny.
Not bad.
It's not easy to get out of a bad foot.
It doesn't matter.
It's not my duty to share the ways of Tom.
It's not an open code design.
That's not true.
It's not gonna shut up if you don't have anything to say.
It's not such a long flight.
It's not that he's really good at me.
It doesn't make any sense that people are sending fake data when they're posted to Internet sites.
That's not what we want.
It's going to take over in Moscow.
Now Terry.
Obviously she spoke English.
Of course she's sick.
In case I was born today.
It's one of the things I love about you.
It's on his last leg.
It's just a guess.
It's on my ticket list.
In a short time, it began to rain a fluff.
It sounds wrong.
Sounds like you're okay.
It's our job to help you.
It's been a while.
Absolutely safe here.
That's pretty good.
Outside of the rain.
I'm gonna have a strong breath, but I have to go.
It's pretty cold for April.
It's really interesting to convert all this stuff into other languages.
You're sitting a little breathy.
It's so different.
It's still a big risk.
It's such a beautiful day.
What a bazaar.
That's enough.
That's an answer from a servant.
It's midnight.
It's the coolest blow I've ever seen.
It's the same thing every time.
That was the best for me.
The suspect's been squeezing.
The suspect's been slamming the boat.
It's three and a half now.
It's time for lunch.
It's time to leave.
It's time for you to stop London all the time about the witness flu.
It's time to go to bed.
It's time to play the Jaker.
It's time to get the cake out of the oven.
It's Tom's dream to live in the mountains.
It's too big.
It's too cold for me.
It's too big.
It's too big.
Yeah.
It's not clear why Tom did it.
It's very freaky.
It's very heavy.
It's really far.
Very hot.
It's very important to her.
It's very cool.
It's very embarrassing.
It's very special.
It's hotter.
It's gonna hurt me.
Today is your birthday, isn't it, Yuri?
It's your bravery that makes you completely unsatisfied.
The taste's just good.
We need to be forced to do what you've done.
It took her a long time to pick a dress.
Take me about three hours to complete home education in mathematics.
It took me a long time to convince myself that I'm doing this wrong.
I needed a week to get rid of my tensions.
We need three days to clean the room.
Take me three hours to complete my homework.
You took enough time to get here.
It's using solar energy.
That was a lot of success.
That was enough.
It was a failure.
It was for me the gold coin.
It was a bit scary.
It was almost too easy.
It was already late, so I went home.
It was a shame to keep the thing secret.
It was a great place.
It was a test.
It was a tough job.
It must have been exciting.
That was a stupid idea.
It was in Oxford that you studied history.
It was an austerity.
It was a mess.
It was cold.
It was from Svage.
It was during the cold time that my wife and I were scared.
It was fun to have a party together.
There was a hard point to ask for Mary the widow.
It was her final turn.
There was no way to find a solution that really meant it.
It was impossible to break the chain.
There was no way to stand before that.
It was just a dream.
It was just the beauty.
It was a year ago.
It's gone to waste.
It was a duty.
It wasn't clear if they ended it, if it wasn't.
Until I read the book, I didn't know anything about it.
I haven't checked anything by yesterday.
It wasn't so good.
It wasn't that easy to do it.
That wasn't meant.
It hasn't been a long time, and Mr. Imazaki will be dead.
That was pretty nice.
It's going to blow a blow, and it's hard, the spirit's starting to conquer.
We're going to blow the triggers, so we're playing inside.
It's going to rain in peace.
It was pretty uncomfortable.
It was very cold.
It's hot, but it wasn't too cold out there.
It was so hot that she thought of it as a gladiator.
It was my night of life.
That was the big deal of my life.
It was the wife's fault.
It was the first time I walked through the Mogami.
It was the worst thing in my life.
You bought that Mary last night.
It was too late.
It was lucky.
It was awful to see you again.
He's gone yesterday.
You bought the dress Mike yesterday.
It'll be clear in time.
It'll be hard for him to figure it out.
It's gonna happen.
September is approaching.
It won't take long.
It'll be dangerous to get close to hard money.
It would be nice if you could make me something to eat.
I've been around a little, Tom.
I understand how you feel.
I understand Tom.
I understand why.
I understand your feelings.
Yesterday I met in the bus unexpectedly a friend of mine.
I used to come to this beach when I was a kid.
I used to dream about you.
I went out to the hospital every summer before.
I used to go to church the first day.
I once assessed it, but not yet.
I used to drive through the river often.
I used to lose the roof.
I used to move near his house of Tom too every day.
I used to work full-time at the restaurant.
I use needles almost every day.
I'm usually on my way to eight o'clock.
I usually play tennis.
I'm usually calling the appointments in the hospital.
I almost finished what I had to do.
I've already given up his birthday present.
I've already made plans.
I've already read this novel.
I've already started doing this.
I always wanted to write a child book.
I figured we'd have some privacy.
I've been a friend of this organization for five years.
I've been calling all day.
I've been through a lot lately.
I ate the bastard we had a few days ago.
I have a chance to check this device.
I was given permission to test this device.
I've been here a while since you were here.
I've been here a month.
I was hoping to meet you.
I was in prison more than once.
I've given you an eye.
I've been studying as a nurse since I was 30 years old.
I'm told you're looking for a bisitter.
I was angry that I didn't blame you.
I gave you.
I totally forgot what it was.
I forgot my name.
I found it alone, don't thank you!
I've been on the balance lately.
I have much more to learn.
I have a meeting at 2:30.
I have a toothache, it kills me.
I've got wounds and kids.
