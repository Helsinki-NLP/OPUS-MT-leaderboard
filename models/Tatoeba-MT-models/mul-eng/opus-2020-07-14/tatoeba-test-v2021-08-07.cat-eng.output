I made a mistake.
I asked Mr Smith
I heard what you said.
I heard her story.
I wrote a letter.
I wrote a cookbook.
I was glad to see that at the end it made sense.
I read several books last week.
I noticed that she was sitting on the front line.
I opened the box.
I thought he was angry and he would go.
It was me who called the door.
I called before.
I saw the man hit by a car.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He fought against racial discrimination.
We went without him because he wasn't ready.
He left for the United States.
He died three years ago.
We called at the door for five minutes, but it was gone.
They had to put their hand on Tom.
They went through the topic right now.
He passed by my side to see that he didn't know me.
He lost all his money.
He painted the blue door.
He tried to cut the taron.
I went to Kyoto.

He came home three hours later.
He comes here every five days.
I see the moon on the horizon.
You come here all day?
Come when you want.
Do you come here every day?
We'll take her to dinner.
Watch your car and cross the street.
Come with us.
Come when you want.
Come when you want.
You're right.

They live on the other side of the river.
You live in Tokyo?
I'd like to meet your older sister.
I'd like an aspirin.
I'd like a clearer one.
We want complete prayers.
I wanted to buy the book, but I realized I didn't have more than 200 eggs.
You want to marry me?
Do you want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
Would you like to take another fee from you?
You want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than she is.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America for a few days.
I want to learn the hope.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book.
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with the clean air.
