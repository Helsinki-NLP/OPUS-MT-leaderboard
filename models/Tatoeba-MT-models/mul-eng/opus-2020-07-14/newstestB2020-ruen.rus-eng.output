TikTok hides uneven videos from users
According to TikTok, the world's users are over 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are younger than 18 years old.

The Chinese social network TikTok presents a video scene that mentions the Taannim area, the independence of Tibet or the banned religious group of Falungun, says The Guardian.
The documents in the publication state that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) is promoting China's foreign policy objectives through the annex.
The main part of China's policy violations falls under the “disgusting of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places uneven publications in the context of general rules so that social networks do not look censorious.
For example, the ban on the criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of “critical or attack on the policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the Taannimmen or genocide in Cambodia falls under "the history of China or other countries".
A list of the prohibited names of twenty "foreign leaders or public actors", including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Chen Yina, Indian political Mahatmo Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trumpa and Baraca Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abee, South Korean President Pak Kin Hei, President of Indonesia, Jacques Vido Vido and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by cell administrators and can be blocked by the user.
Not too strict is the second category: such publications remain on the website, but their distribution is limited by the TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules were old and no longer applicable: "We are now using a localized approach, as well as attracting independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, the author of the "Producer Centre" of the Russian Federation.
The Consumer Centre is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the Prodüser Centre are compatible with the representatives of the community, but the user materials can be placed without agreement, provided by Goddanov.
Whether it is possible to speak about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bhutanans are responding positively and say that he has seen such publications.
The founder of our Digital Roman Zaripov agency agreed: "The basic rules for TikTok users are set out in the User Agreement: there cannot be a shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on."
Under these rules, however, any content that does not like the moderators may be subject to note by Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the world's users are over 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are younger than 18 years of age.
According to the Terms of Use, TikTok can only be used by persons under the age of 13.
Soxin administrators check their age by using artificial intelligence: a minor analyzes the person and determines how many years a person looks, says Goddans.
If the user decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, it will be added.
According to the RBC, byteDance opened office in Moscow in September 2019 in the WeWork cowarking Territory.

In Crimea, they proposed a green alternative course in NATO
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, should take the initiative to establish good neighbourly relations with Russia instead of entering NATO.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-Chair of the Assembly of the Slovenian Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinez reported on this.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of the predecessor, but should listen to the [United States President] council, Donald Trampa, which he has listened to the oxygen person, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinez told journalists "REA News".
The Chegrinese noted that Zelenski was a good actor, but a bad politician.

Money is the most important football.
"Barcelona" smells like Nemara.
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player, Nemer, are trying to win a financial dispute that occurred after the French attack in Paris, St. German.
The case was almost brought to court, but Catholics suggested that the game be resolved without Femid's involvement.
Otherwise they will reject him in return.
Nemir and his brother, also a Brazilian agent, took an interesting focus: according to the Bars, which the game signed in 2016, he had to receive 40 million euros.
However, a year later, for example, Forvard had been in the IPJ for the record of 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to remove the remaining 18.
However, legal Brazilians insist that the club owes it a further percentage of the payment period.
When it became known in the capital of Catalonia about the claims of Nemera, Barcelona made a call for a meeting.
"Sine border" insists that the bonus was expected to implement the whole contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the game was based on a quarter of EUR 40 million and requires the return of the proportion of the first payment.
But it's interesting that in the summer, Nimer and Barsa almost agreed to return the "devil" game to the Catalan valley.
True, the deal was slow, but hope for the return of the Forvarda remains.
And here's what Sport.Ru reports with reference to the insaiders, the law firm told the players that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in court, it would exclude the possibility of a Brazilian return.
Nemir himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catholics would buy him back.

The pension can be paid not only by the Pension Fund of the RFF but also by non-State pension funds.
NPF is private companies, reports Volgograd's truth.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and in time, they return your money with interest.
If you were interested in this way, you would start to study information about the NFP on the Bank of Russia.
All funds are working on the same rules as federal laws.
Pensionable balls can be purchased by law.
The number of missing balls depends on how many years you don't have to pay for your pension.
This approach is appropriate for those who have worked informally.
In addition, contributions can be made to your relative, for example, to your wife-in-law.
Recommendation for those who are thinking about pension at the beginning of their work journey.
The increased amount of pension payments is received by staff of the services, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the areas of the North.
In order not to give up on you when you are old, take care of it earlier.
Buy real estate, money, precious books, deposit money.

However, the whole TNT channel leader decided to close all disputes together.

The footballist Paul Mamaev, who was released last week from the U.S. U.A. column, is not returning to the football club "Krastadar".
The former vice-president of this club may sign a contract with the Rostov FC - reports the Campionat portal.
According to the release, negotiations between the representatives of Rostova and Mamaeva are now in the final stage.
The contract with 31-year-old football player is expected to be signed for two years with the possibility of extending another season.
Sport Express writes that the day before, Paul Mamaev had to undergo a medical examination in the Moscow Dinamo, but the check was not due to an "undefined situation in the club".
"Freshman" broke the contract with Mamaev last week after the parties' agreement.
A semi-protector has been playing for the Red Cross Club since 2014.
With his command, he won the bronze of the Russian champion twice.
Previously, Mamaev had spoken about Moscow "Torpedo" and CSCA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for the Russian Federation, with 15 mothers.

A man with a Samurai sword tried to stand in a mossy dog
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested for trying to kill after the Samurai sword had been removed from his opponent in dispute because of his discovery in the mosque.
The 54-year-old Curtis Miller was buried in a museum on the ground floor of an abandoned house.
This was noted by the late Todd Beavers.
The last one decided to join the search and find a black cell.
Miller saw Bivers find and broke up.
He thought he might claim to be on TV, just as the first time he started to dig in a museum.
The men started arguing.
Bevers suddenly caught up with her and ran away with her on the side of her house.
Then Miller took the same dog in the Samurai sword and pursued the opponent.
He got Bevers around his house.
Miller pulled his sword out of his leg and began to slamm them in the direction of the train driver.
Bevers told Miller that the story was recorded in the video.
I noticed the video camera, Miller ran away, but he threatened to come back.
Bevers left a tent in the yard and went home.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unknown woman come to him in the courtyard and remove the veil, shouting insults.
The police have already asked Miller to drive a car without the right.
The men were arrested, accused of attempted murder.
In September it was reported that in Hardstone, New Jersey, U.S.A., the manager of the Hedge Fund attacked an unknown woman and wounded her sword.
He thus reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding that was held in the same hotel where he stayed did not allow him to get drunk.
Three-thirds of the mass irregularity
"The Moscow case" against the participants of the annual protest action is more pronounced than ever, and is losing political momentum.
The evidence of the fact that the “mass irregularities” are not subject to checks, but in the absence of a political decision to drop this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of charges.
The destruction of the case must bring comfort to the society, but the conviction will be left to the ultimate disintegration of the forces whose efforts to fill the matter by figures and evidence have been unsuccessful.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining in the case accused under paragraph 212 of UNHCR (mass orders) - Alexei Minyaillo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and after a few hours and all rehabilitated: the SCR dropped his charges.
Almost two months ago, several professional communities, including historians, priests, and literatories, came under arrest.
Following that, only two accused were involved in mass misconduct (the accused were 13): Sergei Fomin, transferred on 3 September under house arrest, and Samiriddin Rajabov, who was sentenced to the arrest by the court by the end of December (he was also accused of violence against the representative of the government, p. 318).
The Court sentenced the author of a petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States
The Court of the Rigi's Video Objection sentenced the author of a petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States of America to Denise Barteck.
It is noted that men appointed 80 hours of correction and one year of training.
"Good sense - not the strongest part of our system," commented the Bartek court decision.
He also added that punishment is usually less than they ask for.
The collection of signatures for Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, signatures of Latvia ' s accession to the Galactic Empire and the exit of the solar system and the Middle East were collected from this petition.
It is noted that in the case of Barteck, a criminal case had been brought against him under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country, "A public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Meanwhile, in 2016, the author of the Internet petition on Latvia's accession to Russia received six years of imprisonment.

Russian TV offers to punish police abuse on the Internet
The Ministry of the Interior of Russia has prepared amendments to the Law on Police to protect the protection of the regime from the spread of information on the Internet.
On Friday at the Federal Legal Office, a request was made for a public discussion of the bill, but the draft document was not yet published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is designed to protect the dignity and dignity of a police officer from the " dissemination of information and communications networks, including on the Internet, of messages of the nature of the communication, including the conduct of the media".
It is not clear in what way it is supposed to protect the police from the locks on the network.
In this context, the wording of the document states that the provisions of the amendment will be applied “by way of individualization of the mechanism” already provided for in the preamble to the law on the blockade of posts that offend the authorities and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March of that year.
The draft final text will be published after public discussions and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the Explanatory Note, amendments to the O Police Act should enter into force in January 2020.
On 18 March, President Vladimir Putin signed the "extraordinary disrespect for the State" law on the Internet.
According to this document, the Roscomnadsor warns against the violation of resources and gives him the strength to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the ban, fines of 30 to 300 thousand rubles were imposed, and for the reunion of the administrative arrest by 15 August.
On 12 April, the Roskomnadsor first applied this regulation to SMEs, blocking the Roseslav version 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Grand District Court in the New York area seized a local population of 30,000 rubles because it had placed in the network “two records of information in an inexhaustible form that violates human dignity and public morality and expresses a clear lack of respect for the society, the State, the authorities of the State of State in the RFP”.
Named after the decrease in the interest rate
Residential loans in Russia will be reduced by the end of 2019.
In this regard, Alexander Plutnik, Director-General of the Dom.rf Credit Organization, handed over Interfax.

The programme provides for “encourage access to families with medium-sized means, including the creation of acquisition opportunities (their housing with mortgage credit to be less than 8 per cent)”.
Earlier in September it was announced that one of the biggest players in the Russian mortgage market - Sberbank - plans to make another reduction in housing credits by the end of 2019.
Will Phytoestrogens and phitonandrogens help to enhance youth?
Phytoandrogens' theme is under investigation.
One of the most famous is the founder of the bullet.
And these phytoestrogens are carefully studied and have a positive effect on the organism.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with ageing (including heart disease, some types of cancer).
The known sources of phytoestrogens are all beads (the most popular salt), hamel, seed salt.
In addition, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be fully replaced by natural hormones.
It cannot be excluded from any such additions.
For example, their adoption may reduce the production of their own hormones by being too many analogues outside the body.
The Vertenes called for the creation of the Kazakhstann Jenes.
The former attacker "Rotora" and the Russian Federation, Oleg Verentennikov, joined in the repatriation actions of the Kazakhstann Women.
A club from Astana, which has been called "Dinamo", "Celinnik", "Astana" and "Genis", was formed in 2014.
Vertenenis protected his flowers in 2004 and 2008.
"He learned about the action to restore the football club "Genes", organized by his patients.
And I couldn't stay on the side!
In this club, I've spent a half season.
It was not the best time for results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its patients who were always with the team!
It's always in the memory of the Monathpas's stadium, where I killed my 200th sword in a career!
"Genes" must be reborn!
He's got great history and beautiful patients.
I want the best for them, and I believe that the authorities of the city will return to their family club."
Bustion's complex started on the Onics Rocket.
The miniborons first held a glass of rockets from the Boston complex in Chukotke.
Onics started at a distance of 350 kilometers and 200 of them flew over the dry surface, which is a record for this type of rocket.
The safety of the arrows provided approximately 10 warships and vessels of the Pacific fleet, as well as maritime aircraft, reported to the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the IMF.
I've never used Boston before in Chukotke.
The Hydrometh Centre called the true folk note
In Russia there are many folklores that people are trying to predict.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
In the Hydrometh Centre, all the notes that the crew was working were checked.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can truly be trusted in a short period of time.
As Dr. Hidrommett Center of Russia told Roman Wilfand, if the sun shines on the horizon, the next day will truly shine, as our ancestors have noted.
And if the sky should give light, the next day they would wish.
The second working note is based on bird monitoring.
They're usually talking about bats, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
It is simply explained that when the air is large, the males are forced to push the wings, and the spinal cord is forced to fall to the ground, the TASS writes.
The various continents have their own national notes.
Wednesday, the traditional American and Canadian folk holiday, marked on 2 February each year.
It is believed that this day it is necessary to watch the bird coming out of its nest to determine the time of spring.
Unknown oil Fridays were discovered in northern Brazil
The oil five unknown origins were discovered in 99 northern Brazil.
The explosions were scattered over 2,000 miles [2,000 km] of the coastal line.
Reports of the first oil-contained fifths began to take place on the second September.
With each day, however, up to four of them, like the territorial scope, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they're all identical, and it's just about raw oil.
The Petrobras State oil corporation, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, stated that they did not, according to its composition, comply with the oil obtained from the premises in Brazil.
"It's hot oil.
It may be removed from one of the vessels after cleaning the reservoirs.
Many continue to do so.
And most recently, it fell into the ocean," said the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the oil union of the state industry of Pernambu and Paraiba Rožario Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to waste in the open sea.
In the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east, the protection of the environment has found nine sea turtles full of oil.
And only two of them survived.
In the near future, the Brazilian Institute of Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning damaged beaches.
As long as the institution's experts recommend that tourists and locals treat oil-stained fifth-party oil and warn of all the visible forms of pollution.
Medveds were ordered to review the working standards of the public sector
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev commissioned Rospopribnasto, Minéconomica and Minpromtor, together with the business and business community, to review health and epidemiological rules and rules for community organizations.
They also need to examine the transition to the application of the requirements laid down by the regulations of the European Economic Union.
The proposals of the Bureau should be submitted to the Government no later than 15 October, as indicated in the list of orders of Mr. Medvedev on the outcome of the last 11 September " Dialogue" on the Russian 24 television.
At the same time, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the aforementioned agencies, in addition to the Minista, to provide proposals for an experiment on the limitation of control activities for community organizations in a number of regions in which Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad region had been established.
By 11 November, the Ministry and the Minéconomica had been ordered to submit to the Government a draft legislation amending the CAP on the application of administrative cessation of food requirements which had caused health damage.
In addition, Mintrudu, Minéconomica, Rosso-Turkey and Minfin needed to develop a gradual transition from 2021 to the development of a consumer chain based on a basic set of products that would allow a full range of healthy food to be developed.
We remember the old rules of business community demands after a coffee from the AnderSon network was closed.
The business community had to cancel the SanPinnas, and Rospobarnadsor had announced the joint development of new ones.
A list of 33 departments was set up.
In the meantime, Rossotrabbnadsor aims to reduce the number of health standards and rules by 2021 at 40 times.
At present, the operators have information on three thefts that have been reportedly detained.
He's got a man in the Scurratov micro-crowd of Tull.
He stole from the battery machine and the automaton.
Of the two cars - WAZ-2106 and WAZ-2107 - the hunter picked up battery batteries, probably for further sale.
"And another WAZ-2107 vehicle, with the same aim, took the automaton and sabwuffer," they reported to the WMVD in the Tulsian area.
A convicted criminal probably wanted to sell it.
At present, 26 years of unemployment have been suspended.
Russians have nothing to pay for their pension - B. Matwienko
The Council speaker of the Federation of Valentina Matwienko considers that growth does not have sufficient savings in order to fully implement a draft legislation on guaranteed pension products in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings in the world is quite widespread.
Another thing is how much time she's been introduced to us.
"In my view, a large part of the population now has income that they simply have nothing to give to increase pension security in the future," said B. Matwienko.
The Russians, in the opinion of the speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms for the formation and payment of pensions, as “permanent changes in this area have finally been brought to an end”.
This does not mean that I am opposed to improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we have to do everything to improve the social protection of citizens.
But steps must be taken in this direction, which takes into account parental realities," stated B. Matwienko, "REA News".
The chapter of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) was to be developed, a number of basic principles, including voluntary, tax preferences for citizens and workers and the strict guarantees and responsibility of the State to ensure the preservation of pensions, would be required.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance announced that the draft legislation on guaranteed pension products (GDP) had been approved.
Among its main elements are the only voluntary procedure for the admission of citizens to the collection system, the preservation of long-term pensions of citizens by the State, the registration of pension accounts by the central administrator, the tax benefits for business and the tax deductions for citizens.

"It has happened that he is the only dedicated superpower of the hero that has occurred in various cinematographics.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Spade-wide, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who was playing Chelsea in five movies, apparently, commented on the news, posted in his "Instagram" account a break from the "Wolk with Wall Street" film in which hero Leonardo di Caprio calls "I'm not going!"
Information on disputes between companies appeared in August.

But it didn't hurt Sony.

Regionals have been invited to share business support secrets
As the Parliamentary Journal was known, on 27 September, the President of the Board of the Federation of Economic Policy, Andrey Kutev, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreskin, and to the Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, on the initiative of the Federation to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Preamble to cross-regional relations
The Economic Policy Board Committee of the Federation has collected information from regions on business development and self-employed legalization programmes, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the development of SMEs and submitted proposals for improvement of existing legislation.
“To date, the communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit to the senators has identified the lack of information on regional business development programmes in the country as a whole,” said Andrey Kutev.
In an annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive developments in the self-legislation regions and the combined data from the regions with proposals and issues (recorded in writing).
In addition to the profiles, the combined data from the regions are also addressed to the leaders of the regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive jobs in the regions could provide insight into the overall development of entrepreneurship.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send information to the Economic Policy Committee," said the Senator of the Parliamentary Journal.
Practical experience
Today, in many regions, support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises have been adopted and successfully implemented.
For example, in the Voloyear area, the Enterprise Support Centre operates, which, in addition to financial support, assists businessmen in the certification of ready-to-products.
In the Ivanian area, a business support system was developed to implement the principle of a single window through multifunctional centres.
In the Far East, agricultural consumer cooperation is provided by the external budget.
In the Orlov area, the focus of the cluster is on development.
The Amorian area under the federal project “Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidisation of business incubators established on the basis of non-governmental corolling centres operating under the federal budget.
In a number of other regions, special support for youth is being taken.
The Self - Sacrificing Ones Keep Out of the Darkness
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of amendments to the existing legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized enterprises more effectively.
For example, the Algerian area proposed that the term "self-employed" be replaced by " business activities", since it is "most appropriate to the content of public services for the promotion of self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanian area, it was considered necessary to amend the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including the operation of offices and the maintenance of living facilities, fiscal facilities, physical training.
The Brian area considers it important to strengthen control of the poor dairy producers through the Mercuria veterinary system.
In the Costa Rica and Macedonia, however, the concept of "social enterprise" and the directions for support for social enterprise are strengthened in the legislative field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be the development of specific legislation.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be the development of specific legislative projects,” confirmed Andrey Kutev.
Aeroplanes have helped passengers avoid the presence of crying children

The carrier has launched a function that allows for monitoring the places where children will sit.
When choosing a seat in the living room, passengers can see a picture of the child's head on the ground that children are eight days to two years of age.
Thus, those who do not want to fly along with the small ones because of the possible disadvantages associated with their complaints may be as far away from them as possible.
Internet users using airline services have come to the fore.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines had to do the same.
One of the jurors complained that a few weeks ago he flew from New York to Doha, and immediately three crying children sat next to him.
Another comment suggested the introduction of “Raises only for adults”, expressing the willingness to pay for such a change.
Many tourists have noted that they are now always trying to choose to move Japan Airlines because they see nothing pleasant about flying around with a crying child in closed space.

Sanctions in Russia fell 100 times
In the RF Governments, the supply of agricultural products and food in Russia from countries falling under the Russian food embargo has been estimated to have decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent by the President of the RF Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 000 tons of production was imported from the countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period, the Interfax reported.
The value of the imported product decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million respectively.
It's about shipments of goods that didn't fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the quantities of prohibited imports of the product have been compensated for increased imports from the countries of the PRC, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
We recall that by the end of August, the Government had extended until 31 December 2020 the deadline for the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs that were prohibited from importing into Russia under restrictions.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the period of application of the rules was extended for another year from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The decision to destroy sanctions was extended to production from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, on 1 January 2016, Ukraine, joined the list.
The Law on the Destruction of Unlawful Imports to the Sanctions Country (products falling under the food embargo, which Moscow submitted in response to the anti-terrorism sanctions in the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has authorized the destruction of “sanctionary” food in any legal way.
In order to maintain the West Bank sanctions, the FIF also extended its responses.
In addition, the measure does not extend to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council, with the President of the RDF on the development of civil society and human rights, previously called Michael Fedot's “simply immoral” destruction of food products, which, he said, had a negative impact on people's education.
Furthermore, with the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for use, Rosporabnadsor said early in June.
Following this similar recommendation, the Government gave the Human Rights Council to the President of the IMF.

In Chile, the telescope started to build a value of 1 billion euros
This is reported by the TASS with reference to the European South Observatory Press Service (ESO).
As told by ESO, this week the construction of a building tower was officially started, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope - European Supreme Telescope) will be located until the most expensive and ambitious Earth-based project.
Its total value, estimated by the ESO, will exceed billions of euros.
Most of these funds will be spent on the construction of equipment and the construction of the observer building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-sized mirror, which is about 30 feet [39 m] in diameter.
It will be collected from 798 six-inch segments of the size of 1.4 meters.
This huge circle, as well as two supporting surfaces of the diameter at 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT to get the first detailed photographs of the planet outside of the solar system, the star in other galaxies, and the search for Earth's duals.
In addition, scientists are attempting to use this observation to monitor Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the centre of the milk road.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome was only the beginning, the mirror, the scientific instruments and other components of the observer, engineers and other specialists had been developing for three years since the initial E-ELT construction plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main sugar, with the total cost of around 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
