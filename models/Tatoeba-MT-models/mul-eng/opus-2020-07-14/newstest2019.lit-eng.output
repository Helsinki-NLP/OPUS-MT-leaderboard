"MG Baltic" case: a new Gustavian lawyer says he's not ready to meet the subject
At the first day of the Single Justice Meeting of the "MG Baltic" case, all the complainants were gathered: Sharūnas Gustavis, Gintars Steponavicius, Vytutas Gabšys, Eligias Masiusius and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the charges.
At the previous sitting of the Court, Mr Gustani's lawyer Aleksandra Dorošev told the lawyers' colleague that he had not been given a chance to get to know the case.
At that time, Lawyer Linas Belevićus stated that in order to ensure the full protection of the person, the law firm must allow the new lawyer to meet the matter and request the court to terminate the hearing.
"In order to ensure a person's defence, he must be familiar with the material of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal meeting," said L. Belevićius.
The new lawyer A. Doroševas noted that he did not expect to know either the alleged act or the whole matter.
Earlier, at the previous hearing of the Court, the suspect Mr Gustanis informed his lawyer of his refusal, because he was not able to pay him.
The sitting also heard audio recordings.
Criminal lawyers suspect that the records submitted to the court are of poor quality.
The lawyer is convinced that policies, by taking the lead from the MG Baltic, have supported or initiated a series of favourable decisions in the Seime and other public authorities, as well as had an impact on the awarding of public procurement winners, are remembered by the ELTA.
In the course of the trial, more than 150 persons, more than 50 of whom were members of the Seimas, were interviewed, were former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews were conducted and more than 30 times.
It is estimated that S. Gustaninis received more than 8,000 euros, G. Steponavicius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Massius is alleged to have received more than 106 thousand euros.
The Working Party is accused of fraud and trafficking, the Liberal Union - of fraud, trade and abuse, and the MG Baltic is accused of buying and selling them.
It is hoped that the cheese policy will be consulted with the vice-president of the MG Baltic, Mr Kurlianski, and then proposed or supported a favourable initiative in the Seime or in other institutions.
Ethical soldiers: Board of the Liberals on the right of residence of the Vilnius Chapter
"The decisions to be taken by the Government are in conformity with the statutes" - after the meeting of the Commission, the BNS announced by its Head, Mr Wytutas Tamoshuna.
"Our decision was not something new.
An explanation as the commission was already made in July when the issue of Easter and Utena was raised.
Then we said that under the institutions, this is a matter of board competence.
And if the board decides that a section can behave as you wish - go with the committee and the board agrees with it, then the section can go, but if the board decides that all the party lists, which it has taken, is the decision that all the sections form the party lists.
And if you do not agree with the Board, then it is possible to stop membership and go to the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamosison, the Board of the Party will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Board of the Liberals of the Party rejected the decision of the Section of Vilnius to participate in municipal elections, not with the party, but with a new list of electoral committees.
In the opinion of the Board of the Party, the decision of the General Liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a Committee on Social Elections has violated the statutes of the Party, decisions of the Board.
Until 31 October, the Vilnius Chapter had to withdraw its efforts to participate in municipal elections with the Committee's list.
But the chapter didn't.
Former Head of the Section, Parliamentarian Ausrčia Armonaitė has already withdrew from the Liberal regime.
Mr. Vilnius, former President of the Liberal League, Remigius Šimašais, wishing to reach another term of leadership, has already presented the team and ideas of the Committee of Social Elections, "The Year of Vilnius, which will grow!".
He also left the party.
The election of municipal councils and seamen will take place next year.
The villagers in northern India picked up a tiger that had previously met a man on the first day, and reported to the officials.
The forest supervisor Mahavira Kaujlag (Mahavir Kaadžlagis) said that he was caught by a tractor on the afternoon afternoon after he found a man who was working in the fields, who had a neighbor’s milk and had a fire in his bed trying to break down.
The survivors said that it was a tiger about 10 days ago also buried and buried a young man.
The smallest village is the village of Dudhvas, in the district of Lakhympur Kherio, about 250 km south of the capital of the State ofutar Pradesh.
Safety in protected areas shall be prohibited.
Mr. Rameshas Pandey (Romeshas Pandajus) said that according to the Law on the Protection of Nature, the case would be notified to the police.
In April, the neighboring region of the Nigasan region of the state of Uttar Pradesh was struck by another scourge; it suffered serious injuries.
Cigarettes are Indian national animals; they are considered to be present species in accordance with the Law on the Protection of Nature.
Last year's government data show that three years ago, during encounters with wild tigers or dramatists every day, at least one person was killed.
People's conflicts with tigers have increased gradually since the 8th century, when India launched a tiger protection programme, which established a barrier in national parks, and the destruction of large cats started to be criminalized.
Although the methods of calculating tigers have changed, the census would show that the current population of approximately 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
The proposed cat and dog must be marked with microschemo
The chairman of the Committee on the Environment of the Sea has registered, together with other members of the Sea, the amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, in which cats and dogs are proposed to be marked by sub-roschemes.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with subcutaneous microschemos and that their registration and labelling be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In the year 2019, the state funds will be free of charge for all birds, and in the years 2020, there will be also famines, so there will be no need to care for the inhabitants, and there will be no specific public funding for them," said the chairman of the Committee on the Environment for the Sea.
The provisions of the Law aim to address the systemic need for domestic animals labelling.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by illegal wholesalers or sellers.
It is provisionally assessed that, according to the expected average cost of microscheme and service delivery, which will reach around EUR 5 per transitional period will be compensated for all animal family members.
The total price of all animal plant labelling can reach up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that these funds will be allocated within three years and will reach EUR 2 million each year.
The labelling programmes are expected to be allocated through a specific programme for the protection of the environment of the municipalities, which will significantly increase the distribution of natural resources and funds during these years.
These funds will be used not only for the labelling of cats and dogs but also for the catering and other programmes.
According to K. Majéikos, the mandatory labelling practice has spread almost throughout the European Union, allowing for the protection of the animals themselves (unless it is easy to return their owners), and it has taken the time of the farmers themselves when many time and money must be allocated for the escape and the pursuit of agricultural research.
Furthermore, EU legislation provides that travel can only be accompanied by marked growth.
At the same time, the marking is required to care for the entire life of the animal.
The previous proposals had to be marked with a welcome response, as the programmes concerned were proposed to finance the funds of the population.
"The model now provided should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to finance increased incomes in the environmental support programme and the right to labelling not only for veterinary doctors but also for the public, i.e. for persons of animal welfare institutions who have heard special courses in the Veterinary Academy," said the project authors.
The bill was registered with a group of Seima members representing the Seima groups - Kęstutis Mžéika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenius Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Roma Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

This is the fastest thing to do, but the funny actor Brigit Arsobaitė has played a role in the molasses ever since.
From the beginning of the series "Mothers is doing better", then the show "Melagas" and finally comes "Melagues".
In this film Brigita is playing a great man of the Danish Kazlaus hero.
"I liked the film "Melagues," because I'm more a theatre actor and I've seen China very rarely.
A great team of colleagues has been gathered from the very beginning with the excellent results of the vendor.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the area was Sunny!
For the rest of my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never been surprised by those small, decorative fiefs.
However, during the film, Sunny became so upset with me that the sympathy became both, and finally I even insisted on buying it from the family but failed," said the actor.
A new Lithuanian comedy "Melagai" that has been producing Lithuanian movies "Ne experience" and "Tarp our, boys..." by Paulus Virbickas and producer Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionovas.
Your favorite thing you just reported is she's waiting.
It would be great to know, just... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
When you don't expect to publish all the "good news", your parents are incredibly saying - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all of this happens before the most beautiful Christmas of the year - St. Christmas!
But eventually it will be even more impressive, because no such atoms have ever been found.
All heroes aren't what looked like from the first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė's comedy, "Melagai" offers four-time film stars: Giedrius Savick, Danius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrë Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevicius, Laris Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvinis.

Decision on the registration of non-payments of EUR 100 million to immigrants
The Seimas agreed on the second day to consider the amendment of the law on the place of residence of Ramón Carbauski, leader of the "states".
The 56 members of the Seimos voted, before - 9, and stayed 25.
The Seimas will continue its consideration of the amendments on 6 December or later, following the Government's conclusions.
According to Mr Karbauski, these payments are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
On the other hand, in three years, one person does not spend about EUR 1 thousand, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss stressed that in this way Seimas' part of the people's "support for non-compulsory obligations" is to declare exit and then no taxes would be counted.
A member of the Health Committee observed that Lithuanians living abroad are using a small health insurance tax to treat Lithuania - they are provided with the same services as those who pay this tax.
The adjustments provide for those who leave Lithuania to be regarded as persons whose social insurance benefits will be paid in the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation, and Sodra will be released from the payment of health insurance benefits in Lithuania.
Sodro's leader Mindaus Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of immigrants and sodro's activities.
Internet-based video entry about a slicing forest reveals a serious problem
Unfilled, as a mother cuts off a sleaze, and the little one is still bright, drys down and then repeats a copy.
The video entry has received a lot of reviews and comments.
People were laughing at the retreat of a small castle - not once on the ground, he fell to his mother again.
It does not happen from the first time, but the young man does not try to give up and eventually achieves his goal.
The record of the vision is of particular interest, but it also reveals the danger of humans being threatened by animals.
Scientists believe that it is important to talk about the need to know the nature of the universe at times.
"I'm sure the local drone was very upset.
From their moves, they see they're panicking.
If the drones did not penetrate the environment, they would be more likely to choose a safer route or if they were more slow or cautious.
This is an excellent example of how drones should not be used," says Ecologist Mark Ditmer.
For some time, Mr. Ditmer, along with his colleagues, studied how the drones function in the area.
In animals, heart rate was adjusted.
When the dragon was hurled, the dragons were hurled down to the vicinity of the earth, and the dragon and its angels were hurled down to the vicinity of the earth.
Scientists recommend that dragons be used for responsible use of filming, not to cross the street, not to spread noise, and not to spread where they are forbidden.
You called on the president to run through the paper
On the second day, the Kiev Court invited Mr. Victor Janukovy to attend the trial because of his alleged state-run meeting - the appeal was announced in the State's official authorisation.
In the appeal of the Court, published in the newspaper Uriadov kurier, the former leader was invited to attend a trial trial held on 19 November, during which final arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Janukovici has the right to participate in the meeting in a video link.
On 30 October, the Kiev Court announced the final debate in the case of V. Janukovy.
In Russia, V. Janukovy's lawyer Aleksandr Gorošinski was given the opportunity to register abroad's lawyers' register before 19 November so that he could attend a meeting where V. Janukovyč is expected to be in contact with his last word.
Mr Janukovici, supported by Cremlia, was dismissed and fled to Russia during the 2014 Madana siege, which was attempted by the President to sign association with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was expelled from Russia during the special operation organised by Moscow.
In that year, Russia joined Ukraine, which belonged to the Middle East, and later in the eastern part of the country, there was a war between the independent separatists of Kiev and Russia.
Since that time, there have been some 10,000 lives in prison, despite the many attempts by the international community to ensure long - term floods.

Constituent limitations on cogeneration forces against the Court
The opposition of the Seima, as it claimed, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) to the governing decision to adopt a law on the possibility of halting the construction of power plants for the combustion of wastes.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that the Group of the Seima members called on the CT to examine the conformity of the provisions of the Law on the Treatment of wastes adopted by the Governing Council.
"Parliament underlines that the provisions of the law aim at encouraging existing waste-fueling projects that have already been carried out, by urging the Government to establish new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) before the entry into force of the law in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report writes.
"Parliament notes that in view of the legal prohibition on the construction of state-owned waste management objects (i.e. the derogation set out and the definition of "living territory"), it is concluded that this prohibition is inseparably restricted or even denied the right to carry out agricultural activities related to waste generation of energy, it is essential to establish the criteria so that the construction of such items is practically impossible in the entire territory of Lithuania" - it adds.
It is claimed that the law adopted contradicts the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"KT has stated that legislation does not apply to the legal facts and facts that have occurred before the entry into force of the new adopted act.
In this case, the Government shall be empowered to apply the law again in accordance with the criteria not defined.
When establishing such a legal regulation, the principles of constitutional certainty, legal certainty, the protection of legitimate expectations, and the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal is cited.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kauna Cogenerational Powers.
With the exception of the projects currently under way, the State would not only experience hundreds of millions of financial losses, major losses, and the population of Lithuania - the price of heating would increase, due to an increase in environmental pollution in the balance of waste disposal.
The CT was signed by members of the Seimo TS-LKD, the Liberal Union, the Social Democrats and the ruling Social Democrats working group, Algirdas Butkević.
A few weeks ago, the Seimas managed to raise 71 votes to remove Presidents of the Dalias Grybauskaitė veto from the amendments to the Waste Management Act, which provided for the establishment of cogenerational power buildings already in place, and also set 20 km from the residential area "carantine" for such power-building.
The amendments to the Law of the Seed have been in force since 1 January 2019. Justice, which the rulers have already proposed to refuse a restriction of 20 km.
This proposal is intended to be considered again at the Seima Red Session.
However, the Government's right to stop already launched projects is not planned to cancel.
The CT will examine this case in the course of the proceedings - not earlier than a year ago.

Grybauskatė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment by the European Union (EU) and to facilitate the conditions for foreign imports.
In the Chinese import show in Shanchay, opening the Trade and Investment Forum, Grybauskaitė stressed that the overall objective of economic development should be to "unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world", based on the main causes of attacks caused by trade wars, "production surpluses and unfair competition".
"The European Union is very important to China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade contract as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses are expected to feel secure here and also strengthening intellectual property protection," said Dr. Grybauskaitė.
The opening of China, of course, is important not only for Europe but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that the transparency of investments should be "more than any business group's interests".
"The transparency, the superiority of the laws, the strict adherence to international contracts - this must be a major part of the new investment relations environment," said Dr. Grybauskaitė.
"The corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any state of the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's imports are attempting to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its businesses.
A number of heads of State, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania, are participating in the parade.
According to the Statistics Department of Lithuania, China is currently operating 25 locations between export partners.
In the past, Lithuania's exports to China increased by 50% - this amounted to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Part of the officials is not concerned that China's investment in Lithuania can have an adverse political impact, while Beijing's exclusive focus is on EU unity in Eastern Europe.
Failed to resolve: mobile mail service is already running
The supplier of the mobile document shall inform the Estonian IT company "SK ID Solutions" that the expansion of the mobile writing system has been removed and the service is functioning as usual.
The Mobilistic signature started at 14.28 a.m.
The mobile writing system was suspended on Monday 9.52.
These efforts have been experienced by telecom companies "Bitė", "Tele2" and "Telia".
The reason for the "SK ID Solutions" disorder has been identified, but it is not disclosed for safety.
The company apologizes to consumers for their experience of incompatibility.
"SK ID Solutions" specializes in the field of international e-identification decisions.
These are Estonian State partners, issuing certificates of national identity documents and providing access to electronic services and providing electronic signatures to citizens of different countries.
"SK ID Solutions" provides almost 1000 organisations providing financial, health care, education and other private and public electronic services.
The "SK ID Solutions" services in the Baltic countries are used by more than two million end-users.
The reason for the accident of the "Lion Air" was revealed: the deadly enemy attack
The data from the iron box on the lines of the Indonesian airline "Lion Air" show that during at least four recent flights, there has been a rapid deterioration in the working of the train, the first day the researchers reported.
The president of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK) said that the same trend occurred during the last four flights, including the fate when the storm struck in the Java Sea on 29 October immediately after the arrival of Jakarta.
During this disaster, all 189 people were killed.
A number of media reports of accidents during the previous flight from the Boeing 737 MAX 8 flights from Denparo to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the blue box - yes, the technical problem was really fast, that is, the speed of the plane," said S. Tjayon through the press conference.
"The figures in the Jewish box showed that during two flights before the journey, Denpasar-Jjakarta was the same problem," he added.
"In social networks, there are lots of holes.
Now we want to make it clear that in the white box, there are four flights in which there were problems with speed gain," the head of the NTSK said.
During the meeting with the members of the killed families, Mr. Tjayon said that the information on the flight data was consistent with the reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight had changed in an unregulated manner.
The search team has not yet found the second black box recording conversations in the cabin.
"Lion Air" indicated that it was justified on the basis of the manufacturer's recommendations after a flight from Balo to Jakarta.
One of the company’s creators, Rusdi Kirana, had not been invited to call on Minister of Communications Budi Karyos Sumadi, who was moderated in meeting family members with officials, insurgents and victims’ searches and disaster investigation.
However, he stood up and shook his head when members of the family called on him to present the "Lion Air" with his brother Kusnan in 1999.
"Lion Air" did not behave properly," said one man, who was represented by the passenger Shandy Johanno Ramadhan, who worked on a prosecutor's island on which the plane crashed.
"I want Mr Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention to it," he stressed.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Leon Air has never met me.
We haven't met our son, but Leon Air didn't tell us anything.
After this meeting, Mr. Kirana went to the funeral, avoiding the questions of journalists.
Many families await the long-term results of the process of identifying the dead.
The police's medical experts are transferred to nearly 140 lavenders, packed with parts of the people's support.
So far only 14 altars have been identified.
The parents asked why two months ago the loan was allowed to fly, even though there was an increase during the 28th flight from Bali to Jākarta, which resulted in the landing of a passenger flying plane to the ground immediately after landing.
"Lion Air" said this effort was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved? - one of the sons of a murderer was heard.
- If not, the relevant techniques must be taken into account.
The law was very clear, but they did not claim that the aircraft was allowed to relocate.
These poor techniques must be answered under the law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia will not be repeated.
Mr. Tjayon said that the large quantity of small amounts of waste and the fact that the waste is being stored in a very small area shows that the oil has actually flown into the water at a very high speed.
"The ark was unique when it was moved to the sea.
He didn't open his mouth, but when he left the water, he did a great deal of work - it shows all the lost turbulence of mind," the officer explained.
"Lion Air" is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997 when the company's "Garda" aircraft has hit 234 people near the death of Medan.
After the accident, rescuers were taken out of custody: injured and incomplete
On Monday evening on the road Väžäičia - Plungė, Tilvikais met with cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz".
Automotives have been identified, reports of three people injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, took on the opposite side of the road and gave birth to a car named Mercedes-Benz, whose father was born in 1967 and daughter was born in 2005.
The "BMW" driver saved the firemen - rescuers.
You're going from Mercedes-Benz to lose your teeth in the summer.
All those who have been hurt to get out of the hospital.
Presidency: No reference work facilitation is required
After accepting the suggestion by the managers to reduce the referendum map to the first section of the Constitution which currently has greater protection, the President of the House of Commons said.
"More than half of the population voted in favour of the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendments, particularly the articles in its first section , should certainly be at least a majority .
I can't wait to see the President really wake up," said the councillor of Dalios Grybauskaitt on the second day on the radio.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defined the basic parts of the state - language, background, territory, capital, sovereign, sovereign, state sovereignty, and thus reduced the number of votes necessary for these articles, namely M. Lingė, would be created "unprecedented" and "opened risk".
"In the view of the President, there is no need for job facilitation, more need to be prepared for the same referendum, more dialogue with people," he hoped.
The Chamber intends to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment of the Reference Act.
It provides for the adoption of a decision on higher protection in the first and fourth sections of the Constitution, where at least two-fifths of citizens having the right to vote are admitted during the referendum.
At present, the first and fourth sections of the Constitution may be replaced by a reference to more than half of all citizens entitled to vote.
The right to elections in Lithuania has about 2.5 million citizens: half of them are 1,25 million voters, two fifths - million voters.
This proposal was born after September when Seimas approved the presidential veto on the amendments adopted by the previous Parliament, which satisfied the voting requirements by changing the nationality of Article 12 of the Constitution.
The referendum is proposed to reduce the preparation of the referendum on double citizenship, it should be held on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the president's elections are scheduled for the first and second round.
Emigrants may not have double citizenship, except for some exceptions, after the recovery of independence on 11 March 1990.
The two citizenships aim at the Lithuanian community of the world, but they fear that there will be no referendum in the present context - to vote without enough people.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are "swift", so they need to be updated
The airport and road infrastructure of Lithuania is beginning to collapse, so it is necessary to update it, says Minister for Communications, Mr Rokas Masiuli.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius airport is a minimum task that the State must carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already broken, as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We have to update Vilnius airport - it is not even suitable for further planning, it is a minimum what we have to do," said Mr. Masiulis at the conference of the Development Fund and the "Valstybė" on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, as important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of the "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", built by Klaipeda's external port, updating Vilnius and Kauna airport, and perhaps the new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete road integration, railway integration, external port constructions in Klaipėda, to fix airports, perhaps to decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not worry, we have already started projects that will cost our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Communications.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that cars are being distributed over a small amount of money in recent years.
"The situation of the road is not good for anyone, because the funds are not given enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even the most necessary supervision, such as the Magistralian roads, is lacking.
We need to determine the amount to be allocated to road surveillance if we want their situation to improve," said Mr Masius.
He stressed that the exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector increased by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, covering Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticized the European Commission's proposal, under which EU carriers are obliged to return cookies periodically to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for a regular return to the homes of the people is absurd, because the clean transport in Europe would be burned, which would increase the waste.
Most of the success of railways is due to the increase in the number of passengers in the transport sector.
We are looking for ways to cover our positions," said Mr. Masius.
According to the Ministry of Communications, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
Common domestic product (BVP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 businesses.
Ginjas with an adhesion
Last week, Mr. Masius Seima's Economics Committee reported on the beginning of negotiations on the cultural change of Vilnius airport building - this would allow the old terminal to be broken down and to build a new one.
However, the temporary head of the Cultural Heritage Department (KPD) Algimantas Degutis p. Masiuli's discussions called for political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the past six decades is a value, registered in 1993 and not a policy, and experts must decide on its expulsion.
Mr. Massius then commented that modern arrival terminals would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"From the legacy of withdrawing this old terminal would be a politically important step towards wanting it and building a new terminal of modern arrival so that in Vilnius it will be able to feel open in the modern country, rather than in the case of the really unrepresentable, unrepresenting of our country as innovative," said Mr. Masiulis last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also reported that Kauna is planning to build a completely new passenger terminal and to connect the airport to the Rail Baltica cancer, building a underground station.
This transport should be carried out in 2026, after the "Rail Baltica".
Last year, Vilnius airport employed 3.7 million people, about 4.8 million passengers, and another 5 million.
The Kaunas airport was a total of 1.2 million passengers.

The next year from Vilnius, direct flights to Madagascar
The next spring, Vilnius airport will launch the largest regular flight "Boeing 767", which passengers from Lithuania fly directly to Madagascar, based on information from the travel organizer "Itaka Lithuania" on the letter portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that Blue Panamanian passengers will be able to select from 259 economic classes and 8 business venues.
The new destination will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, Director-General of "Itaka Lithuania", says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer all new holiday criteria.
Madagascar is the island of India, near the east coast of Africa.
In the summer of 2019, new holiday destinations were also developed by other travel organizers.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itaka" will start directly from Vilnius to fly to Tiranë (Albania).
Minister for Finance on Possible Crisis: It’s important not to blame the disease
"For more time, we always have to prepare.
What I would like to say is that for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we collect our reserves for the third year.
But also very important things are not to blame the disease," said Mr. Shapako in Brussels on the first day of his release.
ELTA recalls that, on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister for Finance and Deputy Minister for Finance Miguel Tuskienė Brussels is participating in the meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting discussed issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is aimed at avoiding the fragmentation of the EU common market, as a part of the Member States have already introduced or intends to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how to obtain taxable income for certain digital services in the EU Member States before there is a global agreement.
The euro group will consider the draft budgets for the euro area countries to be submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft Italian budget as incompatible with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the EC uses this option.
More information was requested in Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss the issues of economic and monetary union enlargement: the possibilities for the implementation of the European Investment Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the strengthening of the role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the ESM functions must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and of other EU institutions.
Ballys Buračas.
Lithuanian work tradition and simplicity
It has recently been born 120 years since the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural heritageist, ethnographer and ethnografist in Balio Buračo (1897-1972) in the country of Sidari, the present-day governor of the Czech Republic.
Speaking of the 100-year anniversary of the state of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-threatening national rebirth has attracted many Lithuanian people, including their brother Buraç - Balaju, Jona, Bronios - from the village of the village itself, to all the creative opportunities to engage in the celebration, custom and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balis Buračas, after more than 50 years of travel after the birth of the country with the camera in his hands, presented a wide and real picture of our country's ideas, traditions, people's art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly existing national cultural heritage and had a rare ability to see the value of his work.
In the photos of Bali Buračo, Lithuania's landscape, the landscape, the everyday and the sacred surroundings of our people have been filled with the national costumes of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The material published shows not only the unity and beauty of these traditions but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and difficult occupations.
In the book, we have a great deal of appreciation for the work of the inhabitants of Germany, especially the buyers, the north, the locals, and the people of Austria and Turkey, their holy and other traditions and their descriptions of the Bali Burač.
Of the remains of the museums and archives, about 10,000 negatives have been selected for this publication over 400 times, most of which have not yet been published, which have been collected in accordance with selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, such as buyers, pigs, other areas of Austria and Germany.
In the panic, the suspect escaped from the police car was released for 4 hours.
As a young man (in 1994) was able to drive out of the office car, the officers were not disclosed.
He was taken into custody by the authorities.
About 16 hours, the police distributed the picture of the escape and called on the public for help: "From the bus stop, you are supposed to join Dalius Malakuskas (see 1994).
The person ran away with the bruises.
If you notice this person, please contact us at 112 or 8700 60000.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
17.35.
The police department reported: "The suspect is detained in Paneväžia, and he has another case to run for trial.
Thank you for your help.
Tragic drying: killed only after a few hours
In the south of Texas, U.S.A., a young man was killed only a few hours ago during a terrorist disaster.
24-year-old William Troy's Bylers and his companion wife, Bailey Raye Ackerman Byler, killed on Sunday shortly after midnight after being shot in the tongue 16 km north of Juvaldío and 129 km west of San Antonia, the local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
It turns out that the accident took place some 20 miles [24 km] away, at the age of one year.
He also killed Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76 years old.
The young people studied at Samo Houston State University, located in the city of Hantsville, Texas.
They met on the sixth day of the evening at the home of the Byler family near Juvaldzi and after the wedding ceremony, a firefighter belonging to the family.
The accident took place some 20 miles [24 km] after the explosion.
The young people ran to the international airport in Sant Antonia, where they were going to fly and fly for a month, said S. Kennedy, not setting the destination for the final couple.
"It's a very narrow, unfathomable relefo place, and that language is about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr. D. Lawrence had been flying those family planes for years.
About S. Kennedy, he was piloting and serving Vietnam.
After the stroke, it should be clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not become a cause of disaster.
The syringe was in the closet about 5-10 minutes after the injection.
Its crew is looking wide across the valley floor, while the body remains "problemly attached" on the first day of the press conference, said flight safety researcher Craigs Hatchas from the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB).
The researchers intend to spend the rest of the afternoon and then carefully look at them, but it will not be easy to reach that place, he said.
The reason for disaster has not yet been established and the preliminary NTSB report should be published within two weeks.
Israel's prime minister calls Iran's entry into force "historical day"
"Today is a historic day," said B. Netanyahu to members of his party "Licud," his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of the President (Donald) Tromphu (Donald Trampui) the United States imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions for Iran during the entire period when efforts were being made to increase its aggression," the Israeli government leader said.
Earlier on the first day, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Liebermanas (Avigdor Lyberman) announced that the new sanctions would create a "relative" pressure on Israel's actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls "the most severe sanctions of all time" have begun to apply after the decision adopted by Dr. Trumpo in May to withdraw from the global agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme.
Sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already cost about a million barrels a day since May, and to prevent Tehran from financing internationally.
The ancient Israelites rejected that agreement with Iran and said that its scope and deadlines were too limited.
The State of the Jews also said that the abolition of sanctions has made it possible for Iran to finance combat groups and their own military activities.
Israel is not particularly concerned about Iran’s actions in neighboring Syria, and he has promised not to allow him to be brought up as a military leader there.
Another agreement with Iran's participants - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - does not support the US decision and says that the agreement, as it has been envisaged, has not yet allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The Court reiterates the situation of the young motorcycling
The death of a New Motorcycler in Vilnius, North City, after the accident, the court will hear the testimony of the witness.
On the second day, the Vilnius Court decided that one witness would be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November in order to clarify all the significant circumstances of the case.
In this case, the Court of Justice has already been issued, but it does not agree with it.
On 22 August, the city’s district court announced that the driver of a motorcycling had been sentenced to a motorbike accident, and that he had been in the city for 79 years.
The District Court of Vilnius asks the District Court to abolish the decision of the District Court and argues that the highest level of the case is due to the accident and that the conclusions of the District Court are not justified.
A lawyer of the family of the applicant and of the dead motorcyclinist's family is to be terminated.
Avaria took place on 11 August 2015 about 15 hours after E. Osipovo drove the car "Schkoda Fabia" from Lakunė's road to Zirmūn's road and met with the main motor vehicle.
The prosecutor accused the car driver of violating the traffic rules of the road and caused the traffic to take place - the man who was killed on the main road by the motorcycle "Piaggo".
Early police reports indicate that the driver of the engine was killed, but later after the investigation it was found that the vehicle was comparable to the motor vehicle as far as possible.
Dr. Roland Buzinskas BNS, the judge of Vilnius City's district, has said that experts have found that the motorcycle driver traveled 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed is 50 kilometers per hour.
"The car driver couldn't predict that the motorcycle would travel so fast," said the lawyer.
At that time, an old car driver stopped driving just 5 to 6 kilometers per hour.
The driver tried to stop and get off the vehicle before he broke up with "Skoda Fabia".
The prosecutor believed that E. Osipova had to give a ride from the distance to the main road.
"New Journal": Six "Vagner" Seeds in Syria · Global Voices

The former king of Belgium will have to carry out a parental test
This Decision is part of the opinion of Delphine Boel.
She has been trying to recognize an ex-Monarcho child since 2013.

The allocation of money to VR parties, but nothing will be done to social workers
The Central Electoral Commission (ECSC) intends to allocate almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties this week.
This spring, the chairpersons of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDP), led by Parliament's Vice-President Gedimino Kirkilo, have been appointed to the budget until no money has been allocated.
However, they may already be allocated to a separate decision by the CRA when the legal environment changes which regulates the distribution of grants to parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, President of the WTO, informed the U.S. that "the Commission's meeting will be scheduled this Thursday to take a decision on the allocation of the budget for the half-year grant to the parties".
According to them, the decision on this matter must be taken by the HR by 15 November.
It is intended for seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, to allocate EUR 2,751 million.
The opposition parents union-Lithuania Christian democracies should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, which governs states and Green Unions - about EUR 0.55 million, opposition Social Democrats parties - about EUR 0.5 million, as opposed to the Liberal Union - about EUR 0.4 million, the Seeds of their Group have no working parties - about EUR 0.23 million, recently joined by the ruling parties - about EUR 0.22 million, represented in parliament, but not the opposition groups of the Polish Christian families - about EUR 0.18 million.
In accordance with the law currently in force, which has led the SBI to allocate budget money, grants shall be allocated to parties that comply with the requirements of the Act and have received at least 3% of the votes in favour of the previous Seima, municipal councils and elections of the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not only allow the LSDDP to be expected to receive money from the budget this spring.
This party has not yet participated in any of the single markets.
It is true that the governing coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers will receive at least once a hundred thousand euros in the next three elections - municipalities, presidents and the European Parliament.
The relevant Seima was adopted by the Vice-President, Dalia Grybauskaitė, as amended by the Political Party and the budget laws of this year.
The summit has not yet been decided on this issue, but the ruling representatives Mr. Church and the Head of State-Water Ramón Karbauski believe that parliamentarians will be able to reject the opposition of the President.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this quarter-day session, so, in particular, Mr Matjošaitytės, "the grants will be distributed in accordance with the existing legal procedure".
In fact, the Director of the CRA did not deny that the Seimas would withdraw this or other week from the president's veto and new corrections on the allocation of budget funds to the parties could be considered by the Commission on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take the decision into account the entire existing legal environment, as we are the executive authority to implement the laws adopted," she said.
If Seimas would be able to withdraw from veto and new laws, the Government would, according to which additional money would be allocated to the parties, transfer the corresponding amounts in addition.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties should not be cancelled on the basis of such a decision.

Warning: The arrest warrants of the Activist Handzijuk must be terminated
"I want to say that there is no one version - and today they are more than 20 - will not be rejected.
Each will be thoroughly checked in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and am not obliged to receive information that could harm the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency, and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only then will we be able to know the truth and stop evil," said Mr. Poroschenka at a meeting with a young Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in explaining the murder of Mr Handziuk, while the witnesses, the crime organizers and the commanders "would take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been re-qualified to murder (the case), they will be fully justified and justified until the life sentence is passed," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly referred to the public's need for open and impartial investigation of this case.
Mr. Poroschenka stressed that the statements by the representatives of the law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that "the government is firmly committed to attracting criminals and witnesses with responsibility for what they do not have".
He also said that political speculations would not explain the situation, but would be even more disturbing.
"I call on all, and the government, and the forces supporting the opposition, not to raise unfounded arguments and, fight God, not to use this killing to the public," said the president.
- On the contrary, now we need to unite and ensure that the study is effective, fair and clear, fast - in order to win the confidence of the public.
We just don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation in the country of destabilization," he said.
The month before the attack on corruption, Mr. Handziuk was burned and burned with alcohol in the city of Cherson.
She was the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the abortion, the woman was hospitalized, but the next day she died in the hospital.
The police and prosecutors were not able to explain the case to the prosecutors on Tuesday, the Attorney General of Ukraine, Jurius Lucenka, made a statement of resignation.
After her death, the authorities found public activists accused of not being able to carry out the investigation properly.
Actively, the Prosecutor-General and the Minister for Internal Affairs were also required.
"I will present my statement today," said Mr Lucenka to the Members of Parliament, reading my research report.
Parliament must also accept the annulment of the investigation.
Mr Lucenka told the activists that they were making pressure on the investigation and providing important information, so it was difficult to identify K. Handzijuk's killers.
Bill Gates offered a toilet without water
In providing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates moved from traditional facilities to a waterless level with the revolution of the past eight decades.
In the exhibition of the "Microphone" founder Bill Gates, Pekine presented a high-tech toilet that does not need water pipes, reported Reuters.
The toilet works without water in accordance with the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste types are processed into chemical fluids.
"The technology you see here is the greatest achievement in the area of sanitation over the past 200 years," Bill Gates quoted "Bloomberg".
The technological toilet was created by a well-being fund established by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
For seven years, the fund had been working on a device that could convert human waste into dust or water, which cost 200 million dollars.
In fact, in Bill Gates' words, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now closed and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be made massively, the Gates Fund is ready to issue another 200 million.
According to the food fund, 500 000 children die every year from poor sanitation conditions in the world.
The fight against missing health problems, such as cholera and others, has increased health care spending, which has already reached 233 billion.
In order to improve the situation of the hospital, which needs to be improved, Bill Gates presented the toilet with a glass with the fecals.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example, "may be 200 million rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infection, 100 thousand parasitic parasites".
S. Slyva, elected president of the Association of Motor Vehicles
On 5 November Kaunas held an informal meeting of the Lithuanian massive football association, in which the new president of the organisation was elected Sergey Slyva.
As a result of the request by Anatolia Stecenko to withdraw from the presidential office of the association, an informal general meeting of the members of the association was convened.
It was attended by 13 members from 15.

Anxiety in France: the death of people is a matter of concern
The French Health Officers announced on Monday a long-term ban on the use of pesticides, causing concern for several people who had been murdered in the western part of the country during the last decade.
ANSES announced that the decision to prohibit all products with pesticide metastases was adopted following a new safety check initiated earlier this year, even before at least three weeks of incinerations started in the department of Meno and Luar.
As a result, the government has already stopped using pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemicals should not be contacted with farmers or farmers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used about 700 tonnes per year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Anžė region, where many islanders are raised, complain about the loss of their eyes and throats, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the fairness of our decision, but do not confuse it," said the director of the ANSEs, under the chairmanship of Francoise Weber, Francesauza Weber, on the first day of the newspaper "Ouest France".
The year - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States and Europe - the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USE) is a "probably human cancer".
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe by 2022 when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice, just to remove it from the market, regardless of whether it is alternatives," said F. Weber to that newspaper.
"We wonder what challenges will arise to island Sultanic farmers, as a whole, but society's health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already found that the government's decision last month to stop the use of metastases in the region, which is largely dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, more than half of the 35 000 tonnes of salted salts used in Europe each year are grown in more than half of Nanto.
The next season will be "a lot less salads, rice and cheese", a month after the government stopped using the meta, AFP said to Philippe's Director of the Federation of Plants (Philippas Retjeras), Philippe's Retieras (Philipas Retjeras).
To the trading centre with the review rate, Tallinn invested EUR 70 million
The following week, the Estonian capital is opened to a new trading centre "T1" in which the local capital asset (NT) development company Pro Capital Group invested EUR 70 million.
A total of 130,000 sq.m, or 55,000 sq.m., will take place in the area trading centre of 150 stores or shops, with a positive message of more than 30 coffee and restaurants.
For comparison, Vilnius "Acropolis" has a total area of approximately 110,000 sq.m. and 91,000 sq.m.
"T1" is the first trading centre on the platform, a positive developer.
It will start at the beginning of the next year.
In addition, international transport forces will also be integrated into the territory: the train is rapidly standing, and the inter-tourage buses are soon on track.
Netoliese also runs the main "Rail Baltica" terminal, which is predicted to serve about 1 million passengers per year in 2026.
Paul Michelozzi, Director-General of the Pro Capital Group, says that major changes are taking place in global trading centres, and the development of "T1" has led to a confrontation with them.
"We have created a new trading centre that provides emotions and experience that is not accessible on the Internet.
This is the place of people's train in the city centre itself, the passenger doors, the amazing and valuable tourist object and the same quality spent time with friends or family," says Dr. Michelozzi.
A great deal of attention to industry
According to the Managing Director of the Trade Centre, T1 also has the largest centre in the Baltic countries.
The total area is 12,000 sq m, or the fifth floor of the rental area.
An exclusive accent is on the table with a view wheel installed.
He will arrive at 120 m above sea level - Talin's higher only TV box.
After the review, in the fourth floor, the "Super Skypark" boat park will be opened here by opening the largest boat centre in Europe and the first railway and network on the boat, the company says.
In the interactive SkyLAB research and detection centre, children are expected to be employed for at least 5-6 hours.
In the mill complex, it is equipped with 360-degree panoramic 4D chains.
In addition to the usual cinema, shown in six rooms, visitors will be able to enter the virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D movie.
Greta visual effects and moving by film rhythms will strengthen the sense of certainty here by combining wind, wind, or snow effects, as well as choosing the tastes, smells or drinks in the movie room.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's revenue from tourism by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
"Pro Capital Group" is listed in Nasdaq Baltic Sea, as well as in Frankfurt.
Last year the group received €1.8 million for sales in Lithuania experienced EUR 350,000 losses, a financial report from the Pro Capital Group shows.
In 2016, almost EUR 9 million was sold on the Lithuanian market and EUR 2.4 million was earned for the net profit.
The trading centre "T1" was established by the Estonian company Marko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya, following the seventh term of appointment of the Controversial Elections
P. Biya promised to protect the "unity and unity of the West African state" during the 85-year ceremony held by President Cavaye Yeguie Dibril.
The oldest President of Africa, who has ruled his country for 35 years, has been published in the final elections of October 7, with 71 per cent.
However, small voters' activity, violence, and alleged fraud have had an impact on the elections.
P. Biyos, in the context of the opening of 79 schools and three school staff, including the directors, had been trained in one Presbyterian school in the North-West region where an English-speaking campaign for independence was carried out separately.
The majority of Cameroon’s 22 million inhabitants are French, and the fifth is English.
In 2016 in the Province of the North East and the neighboring South, the causes of the alleged discrimination in the fields of education, justice and economics began to require autonomy.
In 2017, P. Biya withdrew radically to release the independent State, the Republic of the Amazon, and placed the weapons.
According to data from non-governmental organizations, the separatist attacks and government-responsible operations this year killed at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security officials.
More than 300 thousand people fled from violence: some - across the border to Nigeria, but many forced to live in half a dozen forests.
The elections in the North-West region were held by only 5 per cent of voters, while 15 per cent of voters were elected in the Southern Province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya gathered two thirds of the votes.
Pre-conservative selections: error is not experienced
"When there is a lack of places - understand that the party in its resources has organized everything.
Some municipalities allowed them to use their premises, but not all of them were voting cabinets, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you for what you've done," the politicians said.
In his view, complaints have been filed, but their content is essentially unchanged, and the offense itself is not a pictorial one.
"The suspects were.
Not all people in the markets were experienced - they were also aware of this.
Thus, not all the actions of this failure were in line with our procedures.
It was therefore necessary to warn from the CR to comply with the principles we described.
These complaints are not at all justified in questioning the results," said A. Anuchhauskas.
According to the CHC president, there have been cases in which the ballots have not been published - after knowing this, the ballot boxes have been cancelled.
Some cities lacked places, however, according to A. Anushausko, complaints and abuses related to several decades of billiards.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, this is certainly not the result of a significant difference in elections," explained A. Anushauskas.
It is claimed that the party’s activity in the markets was 55%, whereas the activity of non-participating voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked in commissions.
On Sunday the results will also not change - for the winner Ingrid Šimonytė voted 79% of the voters (16418 votes), while for Vygaudh Ušack - 21% (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will formally support the I. The Simonyt's candidate in the presidential elections of the country in May of the next year.
Trupas said he'd probably never meet Putin in Paris.
John Bolton, National Security Council of the Whiterooms, previously said that Mr. Trump will meet with Mr. Putin in Paris this week, where the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I will be held.
However, in the last minutes before the election of the Central Congress of the United States of America, Mr Trumpas asked journalists to make sure that this would be an appropriate opportunity to meet with the Russian President.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the president of the United States.
However, the head of the White House has been added, the jury will be held during the G-20 summit and the "probably many times" thereafter.
D. Trumpas continues to "overload" relations with Moscow, despite claims that Russia is joining the US presidential elections in 2016.
The impact of Strupas requests the removal of the VTEK decision
The former Director-General of the Santar Clinic of the University of Vilnius, Kęstutis Strupas, requested the removal of the decision of the Office of Ethics Commission (VTEK) - recognised him as the time for non-declaration of transactions and thus a violation of the law.
Mr Strupo's appeal was examined by the administrative court of the Vilnius area on the second day.
This Decision shall be published in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
The applicant requested the annulment of the decision of 23 May VTEK, the BNS representative of the Court of Justice Sigita Jacinevićienė Baltaduone.
Mr Strup, I believe that the grant granted to the neighbours must not be declared as such after having come to an understanding of the exception of the law.
In May, VTEK announced that the then removed Director General of the Santar Clinic K. Strupas and the head of the University of Vilnius Hospital Rehabilitation Division, Silvia Strupienė, had violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
In the investigation, it was found that four transactions were not carried out in respect of the terms provided for: in 2010 with a loan received from the bank, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a grant granted in 2017, and a grant granted in 1996 together with a loan granted and not restored to the institution.
S. Strupenja also declared these transactions through the expiry of the terms.
Persons may not be encouraged annually, in violation of public and private interest harmonisation law in the State service.
The law is obliged to declare not only its own but also its constitutional data.
The VTEK survey was conducted on the basis of information on Info TV.
As explained by Mr Strup and his associate, the Department of Public Hospital Rehabilitation of the University of Vilnius conducted S. Strupienė in good time and in time declared its transactions.
As announced by Info TV last year, K. Strupas gave his daughter an infinite wealth worth of €125,000.
However, the director of the Santar Hospital and his wife had not indicated their interest declarations.
Lawyer K. Strup together with at least ten others have applied for allegations of corruption in the investigation - on the one hand, for the benefit of public computers, for the purchase of software in clinics from companies, it has been hired as a support.
In this way, K. Strupas is alleged to be at least five times used in the Santarium clinics for public procurement in the field of information technology.
Pats K. Strupa's quality is negative.
The corruption claimed by Professor K. Strupas was released in September from the duties of the director of the Santar Hospital.
In the decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University of Santar clinical participants, the relationship between work with K. Strups to end his own request.
He has been taking care of patients since 10 November 2013.
The Santar clinics continue to run Professor Juozas Raistenskis for a while until the tender is made to the new Director-General, he is asked to be published again this year.
L. Gutauskui public prosecutor - country leader's greetings
According to the head of the country, L. Gutwaskas unites religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, opens up the minds and memory of thousands of people.
The author’s creation - poetry, proza, children’s literature, painting, book illustrations - is a witness to L. Gutausk, a gifted artist in various talents.
The President thanked the speaker for the important works he had enjoyed in Lithuania and for the encouragement, success and success he had experienced.
Schools want to learn another thing: need fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which was presented in Vilnius on the first day of the Forum on "The Quality of Content: Foreign Experience for Decisions in Lithuania".
In the debate, the Minister for Education and Science Jurita Petrauskien said that over the past 10 years, the growth in the content of education has been over EUR 30 million, but the results have not been seen.
"In the light of the results of the international research on scientific achievements, the achievements of scientists are below the average of the EFTA countries," said the Minister for Education and Science Jurita Petrauskien.
In a report from the Ministry of Education and Science, the OECD expert Phil Lamberts (Philas Lambertas) said that Lithuania was too focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on the practical adaptation of knowledge.
In his view, the common education programmes in Lithuania focus on literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but also on children’s creativity, business, financial literacy, empathy.
Minister for Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakević, offering changes to the content of general education, said that, as these years started, the scope of programmes will be reduced, more specific, more closely interconnected.
According to the Deputy Minister, education will become more individualized, schools will become more self-sustained - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 per cent of their unique educational content, the current educational assessment system will change into a pool of pay, higher emphasis on skills and non-formal skills.
Small standardised tests.
It is expected that the general education programme will be digitally, efficiently used, linked to e-sources assigned to the bank.
The update of the content of education aims at improving educational achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10 per cent, reducing the gap between the educational achievements and the current skills gained at school in writing in various areas.
Lithuania has been planning to update the contents of May 2018 for the amount of EUR 7.8 million of the European Union and the State budget.
It is expected that the project of the general education programmes updated in the years 2019-2020 will be tested in part of the schools and will begin to be implemented in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticisms about the implementation of the Development Centre's EUR 8 million project to update the common programmes for initial, basic and medium-sized development.
The first purchase of EUR 1.3 million for training programmes was announced in early October for the four years.
After criticising this purchase, he was suspended, Minister for Education and Science J. Petrauskien was released from office by the Directors of the Development Centre for Education.
In Lithuania - training to respond to extreme weather
In Lithuania the first day begins a ten-day extension to improve the response of the authorities to the extremes.
As reported by the Pre-Nursing Protection and Rescue Department (PAGD), during the course of the course, it will be verified how the State authorities are prepared to work in the country to announce the state-level extreme situation, such as the flood: to eliminate its causes, coordinate the search for, rescue and rapid deployment from the areas covered, organise their supply with good water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and other protection measures for the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of the 12 municipal emergency operations centres.
On 5-13 November, a practical phase will be drawn up, during which municipalities will receive information from the PAGD on non-conforming critiques and the starting flood, which will take decisions on the management of the extreme situation.
The active phase of practice is planned on 14-15 days of November.
It will take place in the department at the centre of operations of the State's external situations, and in the state and municipal authorities, the centres of the institutions' external affairs operations.
When the government announces the state-wide extreme situation on the effects of floods, the Premier’s head of operations shall be responsible for the elimination of the extreme situation, the elimination of its effects, the protection of residents and the property and the actions of the rescue.
The Vice-President of the PAGD, Mindaugas Kanapick, said that it was important to examine the preparation of the institutions for carrying out the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities of exchanging information, to verify how the disaster was prepared to warn and inform the residents, state and municipal authorities, institutions and businesses and to "improve the skills of the authorities to manage the external situations of the state".
There will also be a joint demonstration of the capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump a large amount of water out of the general areas.
For this purpose, the "BaltFloodCombat" module was established in 2009.
Deputy Attorney General of Ukraine Jurius Lucenka

It is said that J. Lucenko added that "do not allow in the country two governments when the rule of law is broken without any evidence, even for openly exposed crimes".
Mr Lucenko is considered to be an enemy of the country's president, Peter Porošenko.
On 12 May 2016, the Prosecutor-General was appointed to remove his predecessor from this post, Mr. Victor Sukkin, who was suspected of committing corruption at the level of senior officials and politicians.
Minister for Energy Mr Vaichiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Mr Aureli Vernickaitė, Minister of Energy, has informed Eltuta, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and 2020.
In the European Commission (EC) data, transport is the only sector that currently does not meet the EU level of tractors provided for in the national renewable energy action plans, which accounted for 6% of the 2015 renewable energy share.
The EC's assessment of progress in achieving a 10% target in the transport sector is very slow due to the various difficulties, including the relatively high cost of greenhouse gas reduction and non-exhaustive regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), while electricity is less important at this stage.

"States" have explained that the conservators have sought to support a large part of the arguments of private pension funds lawyers.
I am affected by the Heads of State Ethics Commission (VTEC) leaders accused Paul Urbš of being a former member of the Union.
In their view, the former Chairman of the Committee on the Management of the State of the Sea and of the municipalities was able to designate the members of the WTO as head of the Commission's Prevention Section, Mindaugas Siaur.

Germany's Internal Fisheries Manager did not take the position
The 55-year-old H. G. Maassen's controversy was further raised by a claim that his mistakes led to a "radical electoral force" in the coalition of A. Merkel.
Hence, he was not transferred to another post as promised before but forced to go to the store.
In addition, last week it was revealed that a few weeks ago, representatives of European internal surveillance organisations met in Warsaw, H.G. Massenas criticized the "new" immigration policy of A. Merkel.
For a long time, German Minister for Internal Affairs Horstas Seehofer, a former press conference in Germany, announced that H.G. Maassen's comments were unacceptable and "unacceptable".
H. Seehoferis, who himself suffered both pressure on this issue and on the loss of his party's appearance in the elections of the local government of Bavaria, asked President Franco-Waltere Steinmeier to release H. G. Massen to custody.

A pregnant woman's creature stereotypes about clothing shoes
A beautiful girl with a white dress in her pocket - a mission (not possible)?
Could it be that the white hole of the altar is larger than the size of S or M and still looks attractive?
In addition to the large reality show, "The Evolution of the Earth" has already proved today that the beauty and elegance of the earth does not depend on women's kilograms.
But that's not all yet - one of the project's girls will play this evening a successful shot - her kid will show up in the filming area.
"But there are those who think that a more beautiful girl doesn't get the attention of the children or the attention of the blind.
This is just a myth - my boy himself is a sportsman, but I like him what I am, and he doesn't ask me to look at certain standards," said Aurika in front of the presentation with a wedding dress.
The garment box is not easy, with all the senses, clothing - it is a complex structure, with many materials, it has made it hard, it is not suitable for moving.
Some women also believe that the female female in the white dress will look even more stupid and therefore less confident of herself.
I can point out that a well-elected model of the chain really solves this problem," explained one of the members of the commission, Mrs Robert Kalinkin.
The remaining remains of the project R. Kalinkinis, together with the entire commission, has opened the houses of a larger model by Erika Vitulskiene, a photographer and social networks star in Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukte.
"In deciding who the girl has to respond to the show, the members of the Commission have a lot of questions - and all of us represent different spheres and the different aspects of the show's ending.
The task of the demonstration of wetlands was still disturbing, and that - now I can now reveal - that it showed two innovations that were certainly not worse than the residents.
It was a special evening for all the senses," said R. Kalinkin.
The Newman - 23rd - I'm going to act on one summer reality show with Ieva and the mother of two of the two children except for 31st - as did the other girl who participated in the "Dieji (r) evolution" election and went to the best twentieth place.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photosis of the girls in Vilnius, they had to be greeted with the project.
The girl returned to the show to the LNK viewers, for her favorite voice on the television portal.
The international recognition of the reality of the beauty of the landscape in Lithuania is already taking place in the second week - here is the name of an extra-sized girl because of the first country's name of the greater star.
As long as they're only eight - and they're all well aware that the winner can be just one.
Intriguing and unsatisfied reality show, "The evolution of the universe" is already starting this morning at 20.30 a.m. during the LNK.

The man is free to enjoy the Thai box and has a quick hand that realizes by creating his own dress line.
The British actor believes that he is the most important family in the world, so he plans a wedding with the promised Sabrina Dowre.
I. Elba became the sexiest man in the world in the 33rd edition of People magazine.
In 2017 the title was accepted by Blake Shelton.

The authorities do not intend to maintain a 20 km distance from the population during the construction of the waste fires.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee's "state" Committee on the First Day of September recorded the amendment of the Waste Management Act, which rejected such a claim.
According to Mr. Majéikos, the "States" group, which previously upheld the provision for a 20 km distance, the correction for its refusal is requested to be supported.
Mr. Majéki's agreement provides that since January 2019, electricity could be required for environmental and public health protection requirements laid down by State law.
He acknowledged that the amendment caused the president's doubts about such a threat.
"In view of the definition of the area of living, it is clear that it is almost impossible to find such places where the above-mentioned objects can be built," said the Chairman of the Committee.
The managing majority opposed the president's water corrections to disrupting the construction of the power plant of the waste.
In addition to the power to build more than 20 km from the population, the adjustment provided for the Government's permission to take decisions on the two futures of States, taking into account the public health interests.
The recent provisions proposed by Mr Mäžeika do not propose corrections.
In Vilnius, the electricity group "Lietuvos energy" and Kauna - together with the Finnish Energy Group "Fortum" of Fortum Heat Lietuva.
The last one is already burning in Klaipeda.

In his speech, Th. May "has opened up the possibility of reviewing the mechanism of the measures to be considered," he said.
"The Ombudsman agreed to understand that it is open to a review of the new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review does not relate to the unilateral decision to stop the application of the measures under consideration," says the government report.
The Brexit necessaries do not take a decision on how to avoid checks at the United Kingdom and the Irish border when Britain withdraws from the common market and the customs union for another year.
Both parties agree on the "debatement measures" to maintain the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks are not carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be applied temporarily to the United Kingdom as a whole.
On Monday, The Daily Telegraph reported that the Secretary of Brexit, Dominica Rabas, sought to withdraw Britain from the measures considered, in a single three-month period.
However, L. Varadkar told journalists in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"The measures to be taken within three months or within a limited period of time are not worth any paper on which it will be written," he said.
In the past, London and Brussels did not approve the proposal for a Brexit negotiations following a week's report in Britain that the agreement is reached.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," said Mr. May, representative of London.
The representative of the European Commission, Margaritis Schinas, also said to journalists, "We're not there yet."
The Nobel Prize laureate calls for access to reliable information
A group of indigenous thinkers, including Nobel Prize laureates, announced the declaration on Monday, calling for the right of access to reliable information on the Internet.
Among the 25 individuals who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartja Senas and Joseph Stiglitzas (Jozefas Stiglias), the Nobel Peace Prize won by Iranian Justice and Human Rights Activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as the Nobel Prize winner Mario Vargass Llosa (Marius Vargas Liosa).
"We urge good will leaders all over the earth to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of the facts," says the group report.
They argue that the "world information and communication area" is a common good that "should be preserved in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
"People have the fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of the obligation of truth, the principles of pluralism and the methods of determining rational facts," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for assistance from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump (Donald Tramp), who often criticizes the "false news" but regularly accuses the facts.
The world leaders should express their position on this issue when they met at the "Tais Forum" in Paris on 11-13 November.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the direction of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Kristofui Delui), head of the Press Freedoms and Journalist Rights Protection Organisation (RSF) in Paris.
Among other signatories were former President Abdou Diofas (Abdu Diofas), Chinese Justice and Human Rights Activist Teng Bio and politician Francis Fukuyama (France Fukujama).
The company has approved higher charges for harmful products
The Seimas endorsed the amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provided for the increase in the penalties for the safety of products.
The sittings are unanimously approved.
As a member of the Seima Health Committee, Antanas Vinkus said on the new project, it is encouraging to set goals related to better consumer protection.
Its provisions shall also comply with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My mind, the proposed draft legislation, is to be better and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of penalties does not always prevent further infringements, as the entities who have paid the penalty continue to commit repeated infringements," said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, and after the Government's approval, the Seima Economic Committee complemented it with its proposals.
The provisions of the Law aim at raising penalties for infringements, strengthening consumer protection, providing more effective market surveillance authorities and establishing a clear system for the safety and maintenance of products.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, there is no present obligation for producers to properly mark the product and to ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities have not been granted the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, checks, and this undermines the work of the authorities.
The Ministry’s assessment of the period of six months for the award of penalties and warnings shall include a brief determination of the infringement, the conduct of the investigation and the award of the penalty.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
The company often violates the requirements of law again, and only in 2017 did 14 companies do so.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed to establish the obligation of producers to properly mark the product and to ensure its traceability so that market surveillance authorities can better explain the requirements of non-compliant suppliers.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to enter into the market, territory, buildings, premises, and checks by operators producing products.
The aim is to increase penalties for violations of the law.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative of the placing on the market of dangerous products and the distributor, the market of which they provide, the dangerous services provided or the service provider would be allocated from 150 to 2,500 (now from 144 to 1.448) EUR.
The national consumer protection services (VVATT) or other market surveillance authorities shall, after deciding to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or services, be allocated from EUR 1 000 to 5 000 (now from EUR 868 to 4,344).
In the absence of a requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, the amount of EUR 1 448 to 5,792) would be EUR 2500 to 6,500 (now EUR 1,448 to EUR 5,792).
If dangerous products were harmful to the health of the user, a fine of EUR 2 500 to 15 000 (now EUR 1 448 to 11584) would be allocated.
If dangerous products caused the user's death, a fine of EUR 6 500 to 25 000 (now EUR 5 792 to 23 169) would be allocated.
The Ministry's data, in Poland and Austria on the violation of product safety legislation covers up to EUR 25 000 (minimum amount of fines not established), Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 000, Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 6,666, Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7,500.

Most of the wars of the second Norwegian military forces have spent a lot of time away from houses, such as Afghanistan, which is, in hot countries.
But most of all, they are able to fight the Arctic conditions, and these skills are very useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In the last days, in the mornings from the mountains of Tinseta, often in the most remote and the most remote areas, the soldiers took part in our concentration camps against certain British soldiers.
Wars have the ability to survive in this wild nature, but in the winter, they have a much higher weight on the peat temple - one copper weighs about 50 kg.
The military in charge said that their skills, how to survive and fight under such conditions, are shared with other NATO soldiers.
According to the wars, this practice, which, like any other war, does not bring about a real war, will teach them to be prepared if they are at great risk.

The Eastern European Centre for Studies, in cooperation with two significant US "smegen centres"
In Vilnius, for the past three years, the director of the RESC, Lino Kojal, has been in charge of the project and will allow the United States to implement projects and make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We've been working hard here for a few months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions run us as partners and seek opportunities for joint activities.
I am not sure that small activities will occur, but we are analysed by NATO, security, disinformation, the development of Eastern Partnerships, they are also priority," Kojala said.
The agreements indicate that the RESC and the US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge, prepare expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, while both partners have a great international reputation.
The FPRI has been operating since 1955 and is one of almost a hundred high-level analysts.
At the latest at the University of Pennsylvania, the World Research Centres rating FPRI has taken a seventh place in its category.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts were invited to consult and work at the highest political institutions in the United States, is currently ten in its own category.
"This will give us more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the U.S. information field and encourage us to put quality cartels on the top," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the assistance of the partners in the dissemination of the newly shown RESC analytical paper "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" between US decision makers and in the public area.
The European Centre for Eastern Studies is operating on the basis of projects implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
The RESC partners with which the joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
