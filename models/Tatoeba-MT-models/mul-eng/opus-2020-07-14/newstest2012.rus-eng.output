Parliament does not support the amendment granting freedom to Timosenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, as amended by the Code of Criminal Procedure, has rejected the attempt to repeal the article by which the opposition leader, Julia Timosenko, has been convicted.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the Bill on the Elimination of Economic Crimes.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was recognized as ineffective.
The sentence is not final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoschenko in December.
Timoschenko claims that the sentence is a political position; the process in the West has also been challenged in advance.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
The ratification would require 226 votes.
The Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation or the resurrection, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Caddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, without him the war is over.
It's time to identify winners.
In general, Islamists are winning the country; whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the customary Sharia law we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, as punishment for theft is a cut-off.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be punished; etc.
Rather than a dictator of society, which consists of opposing clans, the Qur'an will be united.
In Libya there will be a order that we cannot present ourselves, which we almost wish.
In any case, our way of life is not the only one in its own way, nor is it better or worse than it would have happened to the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that Muslims have received help from unbelievers.
Their only argument is that they were guided by NATO’s dreams, not by the generals of the Americas, but by Allah’s greatness which they praised after they had been defeated.
And if you're looking for winners in Libya, the West doesn't belong to them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies were free from the dictator, their political allies, without any guarantees of benefits.
In view of recent military experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to withdraw from the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, should not be concerned about the removal of “cretans”.
Although the oil companies are getting black gold from Libya, without occupation, is it really worthless?
Sooner or later, they won't get it, and then the West will finally be able to cut off the useless protection of civil rights.
If only Sharia's followers don't end this.
A new wave of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are currently at the centre of the attention of investors.
The statistical storm took place in Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have developed GDP data in 3 quarters.
In comparison with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in the state of detention, and Germany and France demonstrated growth.
And the long-term market is going to be a record today.
Investors have not only seen Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Statistical Offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have developed their preliminary assessments of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data on the second quarter, in which Germany had a better rate than expected (increased by 0.3 per cent instead of 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease, 0.1 per cent (increasing information was expected).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy had seen a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter of GDP, the Czech Statistical Office confirmed the trend towards gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were lower than the forecast.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy had shown provisional growth by 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a position compared with the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the third quarter of the economy of Germany grew by 0.5 per cent.
From July to September, both Eurozone and the European Union had shown growth compared to the previous quarter to 0.2 per cent, which corresponds to the forecast of analytical.
Greece's economy has shown a preliminary decrease of 5.2 per cent.
The availability of its 10-year-old obligations is 28.45 per cent.
Access to both Italian and Spanish obligations is critical.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, and so forth, have begun to experience difficulties.
Despite the deterioration of the situation in the region, the income of the Czech 1-year-old is about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Republic has passed the EU team.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and spent an unexpected cash loan of 200 million.
The National Team has successfully met the most complex task of the season!
Thanks to the great Chechnya and the beautiful cave of Peter Yirachek they won with account 1:0.
The second time, the Czech team was pleased to maintain a significant advantage after the domestic response, and it would participate again in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and drew up a detailed report.
It's practically nothing remarkable in the first time and great success in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly because of the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the Heroic Yeraček; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the European Championship.
The excessive protection of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vuchinic became the most unsuccessful couple after they left two great possibilities.
The Great Peter Chech is one reason why the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football is thus working on about 200 million Czech crowns.
The first minute of the game was very tense.
Both teams were trying to make combinations; most of the time the game went to the center of the field.
This also explains the absence of pressure from the first team of merchants, and further attacks on the line of defence have been taken seriously by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They've created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living wall around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
They would therefore like to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday, on Monday, before the student's prayers for entrance to the building, he followed the request for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a live wall around the Isfahan Uran Corps.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect the nuclear programme of their country for the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Nuclear Agency (IAEA) indicated that all evidence indicates that Iran has not given up its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, on Monday after the students' prayers before entering the Isfahanian Uran Reconnaissance Centre, the petition was followed by a petition on the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum parallelization of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives, according to the Israeli press, will be to be set up in Isfahan and Nathanza, where the uranium is consumed.
Question of children suffering from breast cancer: No delay in breast and breast-feeding
More than a third of the children aged 9 to 13 years have more standards; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren have a single weight, 5 per cent suffer from vomiting.
According to a recent study, children who suffer from breast cancer are usually born of families who lead an unhealthy way of life.
Again, we see the importance of the environment and patterns of behavior for the human being for his or her health development.
For example, it appears on the table of children who suffer from breast cancer almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from breast cancer are free to have an examination of the educational activity called the Ageing is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children who suffer from breast cancer are not involved in sports, but this is true of most of the families of modern schoolchildren, only 15 per cent of whom said that their parents had time for the sport at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was held at the end of the previous year, with nearly 900 students attending primary classes throughout Bohemia.
This is not the case for the second year, with the support of the insurance company, the General Health Insurance and the Unilev company.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient sports load are key determinants that cause a growing number of children who suffer from excessive weight or fatigue.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five times a day on a breakfast-percus-lanch-pecker-suine schedule, since it is one of the unpretentious conditions of proper food," says one study.
No lances and dinner clubs.
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast are important for health development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of the schoolchildren's families are missing together.
In most families, it's all gone by individually.
The more open it is, the more people in every ten families are not at all involved.
However, tomorrow is the basis for proper day-to-day rationalization.
Studies have shown that the use of alcohol in families with children who suffer from breast cancer is more common.
Nearly every one, regardless of its weight, five sweet drinks a day (70 per cent).
While more than 40 per cent of children regularly take part in sports, this figure decreases from two to 15 per cent when it comes to their parents.
Build your own menu.
In the second part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were proposed to draw up their own menu based on the proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences.
“Prescriptions for Czech children 12-15 years of age are far from the idea of healthy food”.
Their favorite food includes a large number of breast, meat and milk.
“The special concern is that there is a high popularity of cold drinks,” said the final part of the study.
As the main mixed blue bird, the bird has won with a small transfer.
However, children were practically not interested in baby, fish, and fruit.
Healthy Life - Styles
The study also showed that children are willing to change their customs in the area, provided that they will be provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the study control group demonstrated a significant set of preferences for healthy food when they completed the questionnaire after the completion of the Ouijing lecture, that is not the case”, said the results of the project.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cold drinks, more children became attracted to simply water.
In addition, as the main blue, children often noted birds and fish, limiting the number of colds and rashes.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals agree.
In the first article on training for students, I visited the level of information on inputs.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lesson of three experts in this area; advice on choosing clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it works in real life.
More and more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
Training is going through every Saturday and the resurrection, but it's really up-to-date.
This time we discussed with Alenko, the director (no man at the course) how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short hat, in another boy's figure without the proper shape, there's one more set of rules.
A stylist must know how to reduce the size of the large pieces, cut the shadow, or add the missing amounts.
We have been advised to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, the owner of a drinker's chest and belly and neck, and not to wear them too attractive.
For example, if the difference in the size of the plate and the beads is so large that they cannot handle the rubber or the broccoli, there should be one thing I'm going to do.
You obviously don't want any money, because the ideal seating clothes is worthless.
You will feel much better in the jumbo, running away from the order, than in the one who is constantly being tied up, bound up, and so forth.
The owner of the small figure, on the other hand, may wear clothes that are red, applicable, up-to-date or in-store.
Given the abundance of such information and figures, I am pleased that I have a week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, taking into account the homework we've got.
Each participant had to think twice for any significance: day and night.
We have to take into account their contemporary appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I have to go to Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because she's wearing a lot more than I'm saying, Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who recently adjusted to the tone (please remember that I'm overextending), or all young Selen Gomes.
We must extract clothing from magazines or find it on the Internet, print and work with the help of graphical programs.
Mudbold - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and the relationship to the graphic image.
It's important to keep in mind the graphic composition style.
Stylist not only wears real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, cotton, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenic told us about.
But it was only in the resurrection.
There is a need for common knowledge in the State
Three guests were visited by experts in this area by the sub-educated lesson on the type of figure.
Stylist, Honza Pokorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polkan; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist to use this fact.
A good stylist will be able to use one item in a different way.
In this case diversity is the key to success.
For example, the palm tree can normally carry the tops of the jeans and football, such as the palm; but it can also be worn on the head, without a veil as a payment.
The second option is to pull your hand or lift your back, and the whole way is completely changed.
"Play with him," he stressed.
In any case, I have appreciated the following advice: "You must know the rules for your work."
Then you can start breaking them,' said Jacob to us.
I finally understood why we are going to make all the definitions and rules that are consistent with what and why, when in fashion magazines we often see everything else.
I'm not talking about fashion shows.
From Ben, a photographer, I knew that the stylist had to have more options than the number of photos he had to make.
Yes, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten rounds) I must be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the object of the painting often looks and works in conjunction with others rather than in reality.
We must have this in mind when we create a picture.
Honza Pokorna has confirmed that the image and style are often half successful.
Just looking at Madonna, which doesn't have a beautiful eye, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The service of the stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cold.
Even the well-known people often consider this to be unique (and believe that it is sufficient to be a specialist in something and that what they look like is secondary).
And if someone were to let us create them, we should wait for them to call us to another size than what they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tables didn't say anything about any sign of the storm/sudden, etc.
On the resurrection of Honza and Mario, they emphasized that the stylist is not able to understand the fashion and be able to make the best of it.
Our work is primarily made up of the people we wear, and it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not create them, and maintain their views.
"If the manager asks you to look at her dress and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw out all her wardrobe, tell her that her clothes are terrible."
"Don't even find a few things that you can praise, and pray that you can carry with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that a specific amount of work should be put in place.
It's the bag you connect around the table to carry everything you need.
In addition to the obvious items, such as knifes, missing rollers or English beads, it must contain no nylon (stylists use it in the form of some items, such as a bag or a sleek), special buttons for the back covering if it is too large (buffs and similar items are prohibited because they are wearing clothing) or a set of shoes.
To get rid of the lessons and get some practical experience, we learned to put notes on the earphones.
Even during a drought in a study where half of the hunger can get injuries - I don't talk about the droughts on the street.
And here we are.
You don't have to touch a knife to keep them from being exported.
This requires this skill.
I'm glad Mario praised my work.
I didn't think of any of those skills.
It's just part of what we heard during the second part of the day's course.
I'm beginning to understand that being a professional stylist is not as easy as they would say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Review
The fact that there was to be an unwarranted delay turned into a routine morning trip to work due to a series of totally inappropriate and unwarranted mistakes.
The ambitions to a certain extent were satisfied, but this is not important, since no one apparently wanted to do the job alone.
Before the release of the new version, the title “Probation” had a great deal of hope.
It was expected that the previous series needed For Speed would be in the new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the race game genre.
We were happy to see the part of the game where the main hero comes out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, there is a lot of difference between what we've been waiting for.
The game is a pretty bad arcade run, but the overall printing will bear a few unnecessary errors that have been present in this series for years.
This means, in fact, not a mistake, but an inexplicable link between the developers.
It's starting very well.
You're part of the story, the chief hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
There are a number of interesting features to this point.
The route consists of ten phases divided into more than fifty strands.
This means that each race runs along its route, the individual stages are in a different and interesting environment.
So there is no sense that the game is always the same.
Although the graph is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is welcome to look at some of the obstacles.
And the game doesn't have strong emotions.
Although driving a car through the desert, it is a pleasure to be in the snowy mountains or high in the snowy mountains.
In addition, runaways live in extraordinary detail from time to time.
For example, in the desert, you fall into a sandy storm, which is a significant decrease in visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains there must be caution not to fall under the lava.
Some races are well organized.
There's a few differences, but that's enough.
Sometimes you try to raise a number of opponents (usually a race); then you try to improve time (a standard race with a second); or you meet an opponent.
Besides, you've been on the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of Jack's time is running away from someone, and you have to help him with the buttons needed at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it is said that it is good for the game, because it is not overbearing; given all the above, it is one of the things that make the game more interesting.
The annual model is followed by previous models.
This means that it no longer represents something special, but it cannot be considered inadequate.
If you're looking for a real life imitation, you have to find another place.
However, this model of leadership is very suitable for dynamic runners, although better options can be found on the market.
It's all right.
However, problems sometimes arise.
Unlike driving models, the model of collisions is not so good.
You don't expect complex transformations and collisions from this game, but if you don't have the idea of contacting the object, how your car will behave, something that isn't.
Usually, by slamming or walking away from the car in a flat stream, you sometimes fall into a different car, and sometimes in a similar situation, your car begins to break out.
Or it's broken.
This is no longer important because of the reboot system, but it is enough to export pleasure.
The departures are arranged so that if you break or walk away from the track, the game will bring you back to the point where it stopped.
However, only five departures are available for each race.
If you use them all, you have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't happen, but you can't fully trust it.
Sometimes it's not enough, and you have to learn a certain part of the race.
An important lack of play is the fact that the same things often occur in the same places.
For example, some changes need to be made in a certain way, or you just don’t have to sign.
In other cases, you meet civil cars in a certain place in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially reflected in situations where you see how your opponent easily walks between the two vehicles moving in the opposite direction, while when you are there, the machines are already set up as you need to either drag them or drop the speed.
It doesn't matter when you meet them; everything is fixed so that the situation always happens before your nose.
Opposers have other advantages.
At the time of the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same opponent will attack you at the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, at the long bridge where you go opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The fact that when he eats in front of you, he disappoints you, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make a game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause disappointment.
Sorry, because despite the simple model of leadership, the game is interesting and sometimes it's so tense that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what's left of you -- a concept with fifty unique strokes, a sequence of gangs or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to follow the instructions on the road, because your car can change on them, even though in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful American machines are for direct cut-offs; and exotic super-porters for technical guidance, for example, on mountain crossings.
The main mode of story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it's individual games that you know about in the game.
Here you work for your personal work as well as for the medals, common for the schemes of Challenges and stories.
Many opportunities are available for a higher level of leadership: starting from the car and finishing the profile.
In addition, the profile related to the Autolog online function, which, besides all else, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other games, and provides connections to the public.
There is another lack of understanding; this is an example of the last race of consistency.
You and your car fall into a tunnel of metro (we'll think that) where you're sleeping on the streets in the dark (we'll think so).
Your piidometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we'll think it's like that) when suddenly you're on a trip by turning your car into hard metal.
Over the course of a few days, our editorial discussed whether, in fact, there were no seconds in the creation of the game, or what its creators really think of us as such.
The technical composition of games is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video on most of them is pleasant, sometimes even boring.
While it is sad that in some critical times, the quality of the record is sometimes very strong, it is.
This is especially true of events involving a large number of participants, where good records would not be particularly helpful to you.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the lover.
In order to accommodate as wide a young audience as possible, the soundtracks 'composings from different styles'; but almost everyone buys the game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Escape is quite irregular.
If the game were to avoid obvious unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that escape is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves sense of imperfection.
Of course, that's a good pleasure, but be prepared to make the lack of it blinds you as the airport designer.
The hores Karlova University talks at the "Students in the Barathe" concert.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-Presidents:
It has the reputation of non-profits and sceptics in relation to the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms, and all games are used to their new role," EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova strongly began his lecture at the legal college.
She proved to the extent to which she was holding her "Principal and open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and relations between them as simple and understandable that many lecturers from the legal college of the CU would be surprised.
Moreover, Vice-President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompie, welcomed the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council:
"The critics began to say that he was a trained sera, an official mouse who could not play any role; I must say, everything was damaged as well as he did with his role."
"The person who can listen to twenty-seven parties at the same time is very pleased to meet them and has a clear idea of what the EU needs to develop."
She explained her new position on international relations and security issues in response to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call on?" i.e. how important it is to simplify and improve the visibility of the Union's policies with regard to countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheese.
The prize has continued to focus on the EU's key programme in the past, now and in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency successful last year.
The Czechs were dealing with the prevailing financial crisis; they exceeded the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the withdrawal of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that caused the minor damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the apostle said, and the presidency and the next financial crisis have called for continued momentum.
It is also necessary to adopt a new EU seven-year budget, which is very simple, taking into account the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be poor and economic, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which are less; all these issues are in the future programme.
The apostle recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, the Language."
"I really don't like the cuts, the foreign words and the jargon that no one understands.
How citizens can understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell guilty or round corners, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is trying to ban our kind of cheese.'
It also aims to make more efficient use of the EU environment and to attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe is our future
The apostle asserts that the Czechs are considered Euro-Sceptics; as well as people who are more negative than the positive side of the matter.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
It considers that there are several factors in this regard: for example, the humility of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful presidency of Czechia, she noted the power and cooperation of the High-grade Group.
"Be sure that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the words join us, the French say to me, "Hey, what about the assembly again, the High Party?" and he doesn't like it.
In the future, the Union of Vice-Presidents is looking forward to major new strict rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a double-speed, if not a more realistic Europe.
"We have both countries within and beyond the Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution for enhanced cooperation."
"It was first said that those countries that wanted should be united, while those who did not want could remain on the side."
"The number of such institutions will grow; this will be a two-speed Europe," Witzenov expects.
In this regard, it stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in the promotion of rules that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all States parties, not just those in Eurozone.
Brand history:
The novelty of IBM begins in the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that would be best expressed by the IMB strategy, it's probably "long".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a year ago.
The company's debt was secured by its first boss, journalist Thomas J. Watson.
He believed in his dream that many world problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His logo "Domea!" thus became a stamp that developed the life of the future giant (also called his internal journal, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
More than that, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson has carefully exposed.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant move to the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her precious values, although she was not afraid to change everything around her.
In our first century, this allowed us to transform technology, business, and company.
In the second century, we hope to reach even more," says Samuel J. Palmisano, current company leader.
Competence
In the 1930s, Watson was concerned about the concerns of employees, such as Batya in the Czech Republic, IMB, among the first American employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, an elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the better buyers and entrepreneurs.
The same benefits are long-term IBM relations with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company had been using talented people, which was one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination that had given it a great choice.
The anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, in accordance with which women, Virginia Romatti, will be replaced by Palmizano next year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; she is currently a sales, marketing and development director.
Over the past few years IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations have emerged.
It's not surprising that there's a lot of ideas in the company that work about a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
The firm's strong position in business is provided with a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, the concept of IBM was rather an organization rather than a technology company," said economist Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabette Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Coloni from Forrester Research, a consultancy company.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
For a hundred years IBM, or the Global Giant, as it is called in the United States, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that this is the most universal technology company - developing equipment and software; infrastructure; hosting and consular services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies and five of its staff have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a banknote, a bank card, a financial swap, a bank code and a discus.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first place at Apple) in the first place since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of her products came for the taste of buyers and were written in the past. For example, IBM suffered a failure with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by moving forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms - if they don't work, it refuses them.
For example, it differs from its Microsoft competitor, who builds and survives the fall on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
The main income of IBM comes from services, about one fifth in each case from computer programs and equipment.
At the time, in 1990, with a double capital, she was the strongest company in equipment manufacturers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-cost assets of $15 billion, while at the same time placing 58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continued its investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis first hit the world.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the Great Depression.
Until it seems that IBM has not caused the present crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price for IBM's shares has increased by 120 per cent; the company's net wage has grown steadily.
The corporate deviation of IBM is to change everything except its own values.
So it can be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this mild giant will deal with the situation.
The history of IBM: from red knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name was "Communication, Tabulations and Records".
She adopted the name IBM in 1924, which was called the brand used for companies in Canada and South America.
The future IBM was founded by four companies that began in the 1880s.
They had technologies, such as the legendary "table hours", i.e. time-limits when staff came and went out of work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Ranlet Flint, who, by 1930, had also led the Board of Trustees of the Company.
Flint's manager of the competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then rejected the founder of IBM in the Uotson idea, which remains the basis of undisputed corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, began to produce and sell various equipment for business - from raw materials and bags to cassettes.
In the first four years, Uotson's leadership doubled to $9 million, and a large company expansion began on all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later he took his son, Thomas Watson-young.
Under its guidance IBM began to develop the technology of artistic intelligence and developed the first language of programming.
In 1960, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights to Mercurie, Saturn, and 1969 human flight to Luna.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family - IBM line System/360 in 1964.
The classic PC, which defined computer standards at that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold the production of the computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, simultaneously purchased the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing fully on consulting and services with a high added value.
Over the past three years IBM has achieved great success with its concept of Smart Planet.
Its objective is to use technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of trade, IBM recently presented a Smart Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the entire trade cycle.
IBM's traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where the study group at the world level is also working on the knowledge of the words.
A story about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, leave yourself alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Rihtarzhova (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Rihtarz (53), became a Teleman and a lover of Ivet Bartoshov (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"The pope can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained Richterz.
When Darina Rihtarzi’s flight gave birth to Bartosh’s blood in her home, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she stopped him from coming out of Richan 30 days later, Pepa didn't leave a song.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After some time, Darina fell in love with her husband, and now she was finally able to forgive him.
I'll figure out who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richard and Bartoshov ever leave, his wife will not accept him with broken promises.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him away."
"But he will end his days, not like my beloved, lost, and found an old hole, but the man with whom I have something to do with me," said Richtarjova, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on sexual relations.
Until Joseph had nothing to do with his wife’s rejection of him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvet, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave a marriage on the book, and I respect that decision."
"Our union continues to work; I'm responsible for repairs, now, home and shopping."
"Darina and I meet perfectly normally, only we don't share the message anymore," said the writer of the Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richard finds a new love, he won't interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't know where she's going, who she's with or who she's got a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Eve and I'm taking full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The harshest of women: Are they touching you?
When you ask men to name some typical female vices, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the following lines describing some of the women's customs that prevent men from being corrupt?
Shopping
Your second half is sorry that you're always on the store?
You need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping for big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping.
And who of you, then, is opposed to the long walk of the clothing stores in search of ideally seated clothing and fitting it (in different colors) in the marketplaces?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men, it can be the same.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait for you to get married...
Immortal Disillusionment
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to erase as at least five kilograms -- maybe I'm starting to make a gym?"
"Are you still taking me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are mixed in their outward appearance.
You don't have to stop following yourself, but in a literal sense, many men have an allergy to constantly complain about their outside partners.
The strong gender also agrees that the more such complaints occur, the more women are exposed to them.
The most important order and purity
It's like an endless story.
My skeletal skeletal, my spleen, my spleen, my pelvis, my bathroom cleaning -- at least twice a week.
Are you critical of your partner for coming to a clean coffee shop; children in a clean kitchen and print hands on an open glass in a guest that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this "debt," try to realize that it is too bad to fall; and that the order and purity of your family should not be first.
A healthy desire to be clean can threaten your relationships as well as the entire family.
Efforts to command
"Brossy white in the crown."
"Are you going to put on your dirty nose tomorrow?"
"The soft-fashioned bats should not lie on the ground."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may appreciate it very well.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want it to be perfect.
It's possible that if men understood this, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Flat
Some women like to flirt with others, to abuse themselves, and to get into trouble with others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, and why.
Time from time to time, it's likely that each of us is going to miss out.
We'll be open, so visible to all women.
There are, however, more serious couples than women, who are often in the care of the rest, especially in the women's workforce, who are more likely to be in danger of their environment.
The results of the Jaguar and Voraček transfers helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transmissions of the hockey attacker Jeromir Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the Queen's flag.
In both cases, Claude Jiru used the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another transfer and was announced a better match.
Two successful matches were also owned by a player in a team with Yagrom Jacob Varaček.
After the meeting, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great night for Jiru.
"I told him to the cat that he's going to die of a het-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explained Jagr, after his actions Jiro killed his head at the first chance that Fleyers gave.
Shortly after the second round, the team also had a "cash track".
Inflamming Harcyensens Varaček ruled over the Shabe and transferred her to Maxim Talbot, who killed between the circles.
In seconds before the first break, Patrick Dwyer reduced the break with a number of advantages, but at the beginning of the second time, Fleyers took over.
Especially Jiru.
After the successful assignment, Jagra killed a third head; his next attack was transformed into the fourth floor by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best game of religion, but he's in the best three," said Jagro, thanking his center.
"I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey game like him."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my teammates have tried to help me, and now my turn has come," Jagre added.
The Queen made a more dramatic match with the help of Tuomo Rutu and the Dviera Penalta, reducing the gap to one floor.
The next challenge prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two peaks.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the boat, I jumped, and Reid moved on."
"I've been looking forward to it, and I'm glad it worked," Varaček described his impression from the last round of the match.
The victory led Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The protector of the Montreal team that Yaroslav Špaček has not completed a match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to the trauma of the upper body.
Together with the experienced Canadians, they lost their dual advantage and lost 2:3 after the panel.
Tom Plekanez couldn't kill him during one of their attacks.
More than lost shots, the home trainer was injured by a large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We've finished the match with only one game of experience, the rest of us were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just need to calm down with it," said Jack Martin.
"The exchange for the exchange was terrible and we couldn't stand it."
"We had to simplify the game, move the hat out of our area."
"What was our weak side," added P.K.Subban.
After thirty attacks by Czech waiter Andy Paulez helped Winnipegs win Tampa Bay 5:2.
High Jets, who stopped the fifth series of attacks, were killed by five different games.
Price dynamics for travel since 1989
By 1989 only five public tourist agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Since travel in the West was severely restricted, the tourist agencies of the time mainly sold tourists in the countries of the socialist block.
Thus, Czech tourists went to the canicals in the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crime in the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries in the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, resulting in significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The greatest paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the Socialist Block (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel on their own by socialist countries.
If a citizens of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on their own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a written agreement was needed from that country; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered trips to the West, but they had to stay around all night with a sleeping mask or having a "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A valid permit was required for travel to the West, and it was not issued to politically untrustworthy people who were not even allowed to travel.
The Czech currency was not freely converted; it was not possible to obtain money (back currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
Most of the Czechs were leaving their homes, which resulted in a large number of cuts and summers, which are still the norm today.
Since 1989 tourism in Czechia has thus survived this revolution.
During the period before 1989, when travel to the GDR or Bulgaria was a culture of our journeys, 4.5 million travel in countries around the world had been conducted in the past year.
The great paradox, which we no longer know, was that by 1989 we could not visit the most popular in Croatia at present because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for visas in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe had been abolished, which was the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechs couldn't afford to travel to the West, and they all wanted to go there, even though they'd been moving.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks, as their income did not then catch a guest or a pension.
The typical characteristic of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring its own food (conservatives, salts, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a free converted Czech crown. After decades, our tourists can buy a Western currency free of charge.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important situation about 1997.
Since 1997, an increase in demand has enabled tourist agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by chartered airlines, and compared with the past, aircraft have become incredibly efficient thanks to the possibility of ordering optimum flights.
By the end of the 1990s, there was no need for visas to visit practically all developed world countries except the United States, which made our journeys easier.
The following significant events took place in the post-resurrection journey history in 2000, and a major question led to the historic first direct journey from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
From that time onwards, Czech tourists are being sent directly from the Czech Republic to the hot coastal country, which is to be sent to the Czech Republic by twelve exotic routes.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit the countries of export each year!
Another important event of this period, which symbolized our post-conflict development, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States of America rejected the need for visas for Czech tourists, which has always joined the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in 2008, more than half of their departures took place outside the border (53.3 per cent); for the first time in history, they spent over 15,000 human rights during their stay abroad, including their costs at the destination point.
The General Assembly must elect the President, and the danger of the road is returned
For about five months, there was no president of the Czech football club, and there was a risk that the Chinese football team, the head of the Czech football organization (FAČR), would not be named after another extraordinary general assembly, which will be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of the elections to follow.
Without that vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Indrich Rahl, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Pacli want to lead the Czech football.
Gashke left his post in June, and he invited his colleagues to join him and find a strong personality that would lead to football in the future.
However, the age of Gashek has re-loaded the football between the two boards of the association that cannot choose one candidate.
This was clearly on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
The representatives of the General Assembly visited the National House in Prague, Smith, as negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or officials who had been authorized.
Since then, it has been partially resolved by the recommendations of the Institute of State and Law, which provides that a delegation based on the powers conferred on it is not possible.
Conflicts with regard to electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board is also not too helpful, although in its congregations, both ordinary and extraordinary, it is primarily involved in this matter.
The presentation of voting methods has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How to move to the 3rd round and avoid the road?
“The challenge is whether to follow established rules or to find another model,” said one of the vice-presidents of FAČR Dushan Freedom, who represents a professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the Constitution, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is claimed that, according to the compromise, Moravia is the winner of the candidate's elections with the largest number of speakers in both Chambers.
The Czech side insists that the winner should have two thirds of the vote in the overall ratio.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; this would completely reject the concept of two palaces," the Freedom agreed with the Moravia evidence, saying that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
Mr. Thomas Paclik is somewhat disappointed with his opinion, although the evaluation of the rules of procedure of the elections, as defined by the Constitution, affects Pelt more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to go to the maximum level."
"I want to avoid a possible representational folly as in the previous general assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plyzn, who is the first candidate; and in his statement he was mainly opposed to Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new President would be known in Hamburg; he also hoped that future candidates would work constructively.
“All emotional tension will be calmed after the expected departure of a national assembly in the European Championship.”
"Football will be in a happy mood again, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonez, with more experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels.
Rachel's got more to do with it.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very different."
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but it's an attempt to adjust the rules."
"That could lead to another disturbance of the general assembly."
"I hope a healthy sense of winning," said Rachel.
There was not much time left for the parties to reach agreement.
According to some reports, some negotiations went directly to Montenegro, but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional train, which was to be provided, in addition to the others, by the Vice-Presidents of Dalibor Kucheru and Rahl in Podgorica, did not depart from Prague this morning because of technical misconduct, and they wanted an alternative to deliver a part of the Executive Committee to the place of re-playing.
At the end of the meeting at the ministerial level, expected in the medium, may be decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobes, would like the parties to the most powerful sport association in the country to come to an agreement.
A lot of government subsidies have been provided; football credit; and the planned ČSTV General Assembly with a new Czech sports address after the financial problems of Sazki.
Pacli is in the presidential struggle because he does not see the appropriate candidate
If, prior to the extraordinary general meeting of the head of footballists, the President of the Czech Republic (FAČR) had seen a strong candidate, who would comply with all his demands to the President of the Football Association (FAČR), he would not even claim a high position.
"If he was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not take part in the fight myself."
"But such a man has not been found," said Pacli ČTK.
The motivation of the Paclica to engage in the struggle against the Peace of Parliament and the United Kingdom is to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged electorate, from entering the FAČR administration.
Furthermore, Pacli points out that in the event of the victory, he will remain the president only until 2013 when an ordinary assembly is planned.
In the future, he would like this post to take on an experienced football manager, not too much about football.
"I talked to a few people who might be in a sense."
"I was afraid to hear some of them say they don't even want to have a relationship with the Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that," he said.
At present, the main difference between Paclica and Pella is related to the relationship between the last Romano Berbro, president of the regional football association in Plzene. Berber is a man of opposition reputation, known as a culinary lobbyist, capable of affecting the voice of the delegates of the entire congregation.
Pacli thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta should be president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and the football will not move forward."
"With the support of a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," Paclik said.
It points to the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelt was written during the hearing of the telephones during the investigation of corruption; Pelte was able to avoid the trial.
"I don't know what victory Pelt would have brought."
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pacli, now he does not mention his earlier statement that he was "solding Plyzn Club if Pelta became president."
If Pacli wins Thursday, he could cooperate with Pelto in the future.
This view is divided into another candidate, Rachel, whom Pacli had supported before the general assembly in September, which ended in the Fiac.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd ever come to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the head of the assembly."
"But he can't manage the association."
"I am also not ashamed of what I don't understand," said Pacli, who drew much attention to himself in September when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade led by Man Macello, who changed Dagmar Damkov.
Pacli claims he will risk managing the association.
He recalled his experience with the management of private companies; he had been running the Plyzn team since last summer, which with his help released his first triumph in May.
"I have the power to keep the football environment changing, to support it for the best."
"Restricting the influence of certain groups of people who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appeal council, which leads to adverse situations," said Pacli. He did not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Director of the Sparta Daniel Krzetinsco.
One of its priorities will strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will strengthen the political level to allocate more money to sports from lottery collections.
"This is one of the key points to be taken by the new President."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where money goes," he said.
Pacli does not consider his connection with the Plzjan Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Jablonese and Rachel's with the Prague Duke.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And yet I can't see the meaning of the transfer of my shares to Plyzn's club to someone else, when I'm going back there for six months," says Pacli.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules to avoid the Path of the Election
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FAQR rules in order to avoid future conflicts concerning electoral rules.
Prior to the negotiations in Nimburg on Thursday, Jablonica's staff remains optimistic and believes that the pre-election struggle will have a sense of withdrawal from the expected success of our football collection today.
Prior to the elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus both on the mission and the acquisition of financial resources.
He decided to participate in the elections at the latest before the last general assembly, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to keep his ideas on football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known in Thursday."
"They feel that now is the time for someone to take the lead in the association," a person who is primarily associated with the Yablonec club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage a Czech football.
He believes that the present problems are caused by the empire that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the June General Assembly."
"If the various modes of representation had not been adopted, we would have been president since September," Pelta said.
It referred to a key document of the civil society as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become a president, I will consider this my personal task, and I am going to take responsibility for myself if this attempt seems unsuccessful."
"It is a fundamental issue that we cannot exist without," says Pelta.
In addition, he says that he is not trying to put himself in the background of opponents.
In the past, he had already stated that he could submit his cooperation with Jindra Rahl, whom he valued for legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his candidate had to be his first vice-president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paclika, who constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's been in the football for more than a year and has achieved a certain success."
"In any case, his attacks were inexhaustible, and many people were amazed at the methods of his pre-election campaign."
"And that's why some of them are still questioning his true identity," said Pelta about his competitor, and Pelta himself claims he believes in the declarations he made in September.
He considered the knowledge of football to be his main weapon, from the lowest level to the national collection.
The National Assembly shall present all football.
"I would also try to stop all the incidents that have been caused by the gods or the consequences of the last year's corruption scandal."
"Soon after that, I would focus on negotiations with both private and public sectors in order to guarantee enough money for all football," a senior candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football head would not withdraw staff exemptions.
"I will need to know the official instructions of certain staff." It was his mission to Strašov, where the duration of the inter-agency period was a source of understanding of nervousness.
Despite the current disaster scenarios of the planned general assembly, he believed that the four delegates would not be present in Nimburg.
"If the only dispute is how to make choices in the third round, we can deal with it."
"The football needs a trust that he can get, just choose the end of his leadership," says Pelta, who has been an optimist for two days before the key day of his career.
Rachel promises that the FAČR will start working actively with his leadership
If, at the meeting of the four Yindrai Rahl, the vice-president, becomes the president of the Czech Football Association, many of the people in the Association will be disappointed.
Rachel promises that if they choose him, he'll have a hard time working.
He wished to establish changes in the system and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promised to address the problem of the bohemists; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to bring more money into the football field; and to continue the work of former President Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football in general."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national collection, professional football and football activities for young people.”
"That's why I don't want to say I'm doing everything myself," Rachel said in her interview for ČTK.
"I am a team game, and I would like to allocate authority to the Executive Committee so that each member focuses on the specific area."
"I'm going to give a good deal of attention to the tasks, so that each of these segments of football will take a great step forward."
"It will probably not please many people, because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement is likely to cause him to doubt his application.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there is any point in it; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put me in the wheelchairs and who doubt my every step," he explained his doubts.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others would come."
"That's the confidence I can't erase," he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to interrupt all of this."
"There were early processes that could produce results over a few years, and I do not want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miloslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association could go back to the one that was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what almost competent Mirek Pelta is."
"He's surrounded by people who would take the football to make it available only to the chosen."
"I can be accused of much, but I'm not subjective anymore."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everything will be good, not just a chosen minority," Rachel said.
Moreover, he investigates the charges that he will only be President Chechia.
"Many people are trying to approve back, but I'm planning to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, time has come to think about the division of the second lily into the Czech and Moraacian parts, the winners who would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Navy teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
While in the presidential struggle, the director of Plyzjan Thomas Paclik, Rachel, was not ashamed to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech House, which has chosen me as my Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," Rachel said, and for her success it is about the economy of tens of millions of crowns on non-profit contracts, talks on television contracts and talks on lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Acknowledging that Pelta was “excluding from the process of returning credit to the Czech football team”, he considers another opponent, Paclica, a strong candidate with whom to propose.
"No one can doubt that he worked excellently in Plyzen this year."
"If you choose him, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek began without significant changes in the committees."
"He couldn't tell the facts for his benefit," Rachel said about his opponent.
The most beautiful bass of Europe
Get in the water.
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with a universal wave optics and status bases in Budapest. Travellers can experience incredible water in Europe - and weaken the standing body in Jacuzzi after a city or village trip.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder was unable to cover during his research trip last year: without his shopping suit.
lie on the back of the water, she looked up on the freshly shaped dome, fell down to the marble heroes waiting for it at the end of the pool, and loved carefully restored swimming pools in the style of ar-new.
She was trying to add every interesting base to her block, with important details about the building and the history of the building.
The architecture of Meder has seen more than 200 swimming pools - and has now been printed in its recently published book Badefreuden (Radosti Kopingen), from public pools in Munich to historical shopping courts in Montenegro and the "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited the “trading in the most unusual shopping malls in Central Europe”. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the buyers in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is the current enthusiasm for the culture.
She's trying very little enthusiasm about sports, says Meder, but she's still in the water.
The only shortage is that the worshipers of the swimming pool should be at peace with the son of a coffee plant and the smell of a chlorine, when the refugees can learn to swim in the cool rain forest or hear the happy chirping bird in the park.
"I once asked myself why the swimming pools should always be so terrible," said a resident in Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful bass."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swimming in the pool and the dried oil in the living room is a health factor in the bathrooms so important because, in the view of Meder, all emotions are stimulated.
And the swimming pools can be this pleasure for the eyes if the builders take this job. "In place of sex in the pool, you have a surface of water."
"The surface is very bright, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visible: high flow, colour plate and trampling.
The illustrated edition of the “Purchasing Growth” on 190 pages contains valuable information on the architecture and cultural history of health problems - and encourages you to draw water.
The Meder water collector discovered several specimens in the course of a study in Hungary.
She discovered the rich water nitrates in the gas tank (Miskolz-Tapolce), and the thermal bath filled with water, in a building built in the form of a bottle (Városi Termáflürdö in Yasberne), as well as large therapeutic bathrooms, such as the 100-year-old Secené in Budapest.
Many of the popular open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, are opened with a stunning view. You can see all the Cuhries from the bathroom on the roof or look at the Arlberg in the open pool in Sanct-Anton. There is a window in the couple that allows you to see what's happening on the bed.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits buyers in Langenfield, and the Aqua group in Ectal looks like the NLO, only the landlocked in the Alps.
The olive is raised by a couple of three open raccoons, which are said to be very small on the base of the Ectalic Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwalde
Meder's pool collector didn't meet the smell of chlorine in each pool.
The name Arpad in Bekčabe is so strong that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a health source.
Water causes hydrogen carbonates to flow into the water. The water is almost black from the skin, which reaches the skin as soon as you are in the pool - a healthy experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at a certain time in his search for a beautiful place to buy, and when she tried to visit the open base of the Czech baths in Lugačovica, she found that the territory was impressed.
The halls designed by Architect Duchan Yurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked at the beautiful white-green building window in the style of ar-new, she saw the roses that grew between the caffeal plates.
One of the places where the destruction has been halted by the heat of the storm was a wonderful swimming pool in Schwarzvalde - Thermal Water Gate in Bad Wildbad.
The basseys have already passed through three stages of construction. You discover not only the non-Roman elements of the post-construction period in 1844, but also the Mavritan Hall of Alhambra, which was added about 1900.
After careful reconstruction in 1995, the Terminary Chamber was a beloved swimming pool of the base of Iris Meder, not only because she was born in Schwarzvalda.
"This achievement is so masterful to combine these different architecture styles," says Mender.
Breaking into the thermal base in such a door is a obvious secondary occupation.
Speculation of agricultural production
The Bank's daughter is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Will Doache Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL Online, Joseph Akkermann commissioned the Working Group to investigate the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg
According to one study, 84 per cent of German citizens considered it unacceptable that banks were speculating on agricultural products, such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that Doiche Bank and other banks stop the trade in agricultural products, as trade strengthens the problems facing the poorest people worldwide.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa by the Organisation of Foodwatch users.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foowdatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Shuman, shows that the world market rates raise prices - and banks - thus contributing to global hunger.
Consumer protection campaigns are directed directly against the head of Doiche Banke Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses, such as Hodman Sax and Morgan Stanley, are being traded in the same way.
Prices on goods were thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuation.
In any case, most experts now agree that the games have rejected the rules of the proposal and the question - and live by the poorest.
Unlike the competitors in the United States, Akkerman responded to the criticism and promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade "is worth risking the good reputation of Doiche Bank".
In accordance with SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Douche Bank with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to declare the changes that follow the investigation at the end of January.
The trade of goods can be reduced or completely stopped.
Akkerman works on his imagination.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical relationship with the financial sector. "Studying on growing food prices is an example of how unwise banks are currently acting against common interests."
As the bank's central lobby in Akkerman has a certain responsibility, Bode thinks.
"The Bank must remove from the portfolio all investments that make cash at food prices," God said.
"It doesn't matter whether it's about the hungry people or the Douche Bank's reputation."
Akkerman's quick reaction initially surprised him, but the director would like to have an improbable image for a few months before his stay in the office.
The Bank's daughter announced on Monday that the President would not go to the Monitoring Board as planned.
Cancellation of the market speculation of food products could improve its image.
He also has no need to worry about the costs - with the consequences of his replacement.
Each second would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign today.
The study was published on Tuesday, a study was conducted for the Institute of Social Studies and Statistical Analysis of Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 attended.
Not more than 10 per cent believe that investments at food prices are acceptable to Doiche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they discovered that their bank was involved in such trade, and according to the study, each would withdraw contributions that ultimately led to the speculation of goods.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent would say that they were thinking about closing the account and moving to another bank.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures — With References
Ingeborg Winsovski
Architectural history with flights, floods and happy endings. Pavilion of Austria for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels was awarded awards, became a museum in Vienna, abandoned and destroyed.
Now they're reopening it as an exhibition center.
The Australian Pavilion, designed by Karl Svancerro for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of the modern-day late architecture with its simple forms, glass-sclums, strong expressions of faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Swancera in 1958 dedicated Gran-pri to the architecture for his easy-to-be-to-speech design.
The building is considered to be expensive in the modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's Pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, he praised the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder BMW and her sisters - building in the form of a glass.
Pavilion, thought to be a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss garden around the southern corner of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962 - often referred to as the 20th century House.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum on technical and space considerations - there was no building on which art could be attributed and bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house had been abandoned since 2001, and it had become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishnitz has now restored the Pavilion, which was called the House of the 21st Century, and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the Belveder Museum office, which opens the first show on Tuesday evening, in all respects, a happy event.
Agnes Husslyin-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new start.
Husslyin-Arco, a lecturer at the history of the youth career in the youth career, worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and, as a result, became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernism in Salzburg, convinced politicians and consumers to continue to build, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how to use the building.
The new museum had to include a permanent exhibition of the Freetown Foundation, coffee and bookstores along with modern art, and an official building had to be built.
strict control of the & limited budget
The crystal was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, by the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Section of Joseph Olbrich, and won a competition, but he also learned from Swanzer at the University of Vienna technology, and the Pavilion was “the only important place” for him, where he visited the exhibitions “at least every week”.
He knew the original design and the tasks that lay ahead of the building, the building that had already lost part of its size and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that occurred during the last revision were much more serious, and the building was a "energy booster," says Krishnitz.
Fire profiles in the glass phase have been replaced, reinforced with a glass safety glass, and the glass glass glass has been replaced with a high-quality safety glass.
The permanent translations of the heat bridge were strengthened or replaced, and the contents were removed from the pipes.
Two low stages created space for the new use of the building, the burning of a light bridge between the building and the street, providing light - practically a new building, but still an excavated Pavilion of Svancer.
The original outer doors were kept, and the building was decorated with an old beautiful-colored color of protection from corrosion.
Hall's movie theater just like it used to be.
All of this is under strict control of the museum administration and with a limited budget.
"We have often had to find a material that was good, gentle and approved by the museum administration," Kristianitz says, pointing to the neutral situation in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy despite restrictions, problems and transformations.
Cristiantic recently noted that the Pavilion of Brussels was a grave, a typical story of the town of Capli.
Such a architecture "not always in its place" and nevertheless wants to "encourage this awareness".
The 21st century house is in a very good place, as the city's planning has been an unexpected success, a fully reconstructed "Court of the Capital" with offices and residential instability will grow around Switzerland's garden.
A second happy event may occur. The second building of the 21st century may be complemented by the second building of Krishanitz, the collection of the Frankish Foundation of Gabsburg, has acquired the Temporary Exhibition Hall of Berlin, and negotiations with the city are reported to take place next to the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion-million-mixed anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has developed an anti-crisis plan to avoid the rejection of winter voyages.
The number of staff should be increased twice.
Costs are made up of millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and delays.
Referring to the domestic anti-crisis plan Deutsche Bahn, Bill reported that investments totalling around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
Investments are intended to improve the employment of locomotives and the railway network even under extreme conditions.
The number of self-employed and attractive staff involved in snowing from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clean snow and ice platforms up to the start of work and 90 per cent of the shootings required for four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of retiring and delayed travel to the summit with government and industry leaders two months ago.
In the past, the former German Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport, since it did not catch the reserves at the time of deterioration of the conditions.
Many new regional trips have been expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in ICE travel.
Deutsche Bahn has also come to check ICE's axis for many years after one of the ICE's voyages broke here on the main coast of Kelne.
The Bank's daughter will pay a lot of millions of dollars in the United States.
New inconveniences came after the attacks in the area of Joseph Akkermann, Director General Dojče Banka: Doiche Bank is threatening the United States with hundreds of millions of pounds of stellings.
It was a small problem for the family, a former industrial giant in the United States who was currently under arrest. The Bank with the headquarters in Frankfurt paid $145 million (106 million euros) in order to calm the conflicts that arose after the bankruptcy of the financial crisis of five major credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA, the Financial Market Regulator, blames several major banks for using false promises to deceive credit unions to buy their financial products.
The value of the obligations fell sharply during the financial crisis and fell below the credit unions.
"We are pleased that the issue has been resolved without the treatment of the parties to the court," said the representative of Douche Bank in New York.
The bank did not recognize its guilt in the agreement.
The same is true of the Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbi Mattz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
NCUA is responsible for the U.S. Credit Unions and is involved in banking processes to protect consumers ' contributions.
NCUA is fighting for the compensation of losses incurred by billions.
It's the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and, in the summer, raised cases against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The suspicious mortgage obligations are the so-called securities held by the mortgage credit pool.
They are supported by internal loans.
This was decided by a number of financial companies, when in 2007 the unemployment market in the United States fell.
The American Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, ordered long lives in September 2008 in the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting a storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims, demanding compensation or sanctions against the mussels.
The largest claims are the Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA).
It blames 18 major international banks for their acquisition into American credit organizations Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac depositary agreements around $200 billion.
The Bank's daughter is also at risk of prosecution by FHFA for numerous agreements totalling $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with a headquarters in Frankfurt to take responsibility for the "real losses" but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank rejected claims as unfounded and reported its intention to oppose them.
Warren Buffet contributes 10 billion to IBM
Buffet's financial manager is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares of more than $10 billion.
Meanwhile, the largest American investor, Warren Buffet, has always claimed that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual report of IBM changed its view on investments in this sector.
According to Buffeta, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffeta's investment has been considered a business venture.
IBM, IBM, a veteran IT adult, has now received the title "Ser IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, CNBC Buffet reported that from March it had received a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 per cent share.
Buffet said that even IBM had not known anything about his involvement before.
He commended the management, which was able to achieve even in the face of the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," said Buffet, under the management strategy.
IBM was focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, which has been providing software and advisory services for more than 100 years now, also offers powerful business computers.
Buffet's been running out of technology companies.
He claimed that he only invested in the company he understood.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of packaging materials and in machinery.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway has shares in the long list of larger companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquires a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s, and with the help of smart investments, is one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His way of life, however, remained humble,
made it a cultural figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost innocent instincts in the money department gave him the name Oracula from Omahi.
The share price of IBM increased by 1 per cent before the opening of markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The global giant, as still called IBM, is worth more than $220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said that he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
Unfailing danger
Following the discovery of the Turkish media in Zwickau, Turkish media began to question the authority of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of the "blood ideology" that is now being re-surfaced on the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of extremist ideology.
Fear and anxiety have been a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkey community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long - forgotten fears, such terrorist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the attacks in Mellen in November 1992 and in Zolingingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, but there is xenophobic in Germany.
However, the now discovered right-wing network has a scale that is not fully understood yet.
"The birth of a blood ideology?" was the title of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the offenders was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities could be subjected to a law enforcement ban.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded peacefully, replacing the victims of racial hatred with a silent pictto against the Brandenburg wares in these exits.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish Berlin community at the ceremony with the participation of German and Turkish policies noted the fifteenth anniversary of the German-Turkey bilateral agreement on employment.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a history of success.
The release in some Turkish media was like a hit. "Study from Germany to the fifteenth anniversary" is one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", a commentary of the murder series.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not allow this parallel to be passed.
"It's getting worse." That's the name of Ahmet Kullage's column.
He noted that the deaths of people who paid taxes and contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the follow-up to the success of the area has been critical of the German-Turkey Internet forums.
The authors were asked why the German authorities had not previously considered following suspects in the rights of extremists.
Some authors have come to a very low level of rhetoric. "If they continue to do the same indiscriminately, there will be no choice for migrants except for armed self-defence."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"Peace in Germany is very strongly dependent on how the whole network and the right of punishment will be opened," says Selen.
Crimes in Melne and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of peace in Germany.
The photographs of the frozen ruins in Zalingen were deeply impressed by the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown to the Turks so clearly that they are at risk, while Germans are at risk - that the faithless and the equals can be dealt with in real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the feeling of unity of Turkey.
Can not open message
The Turkish press in that period mainly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Kul refused to visit the survivors of Melne.
He sent a telegram to the President of Turkey after the earthquake in Zalingen, but his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Kelney, in his speech, in which he considered the taxes paid by Turks in Germany,
He said that he had determined the value of man's taxes he would pay.
The current disclosure in Turkish media has again shown how the distrust of many German Turks has spread to the present German State.
He made it clear that it was now necessary to do so in addition to efforts to identify and reassess the rights of extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal in Zurich
Most of Europe's bank policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The U.S. has not just been involved in the financial crisis, and it is now constantly fighting one, the other.
Now it's German to return it to the right course.
Alex Weber didn't suspect his role.
In July, after his effective treatment from the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013, it would begin its work at least an effective post, the President of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss Bank in the U.S.A.; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clearly in the desert, commended Switzerland for her beauty, for her renewed maturity, and made some friendly comments to her future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the best."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Phillier and Oswald Grublem."
But it has become clear in September that everything will be different.
In London, U.S.T.T. entered into a bank security system and lost some 1.7 billion euros.
The U.S. Executive Director, Oswald Gruble, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the U.S. Board of Directors has felt sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally enter his post?
Weber should consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, the Council's position will be in May, not in 2013.
This will not be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will certainly need time to adapt.
He was responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved that he had long deserved the name "the largest bank scandal in Europe".
The U.S., on the one hand, is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very recently he managed the world's biggest assets, and the other, he doesn't come out of the scandals.
It seems a proud Swiss bank won't lose anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the U.S. had a wonderful reputation.
The Bank combined the image of a secret and sustainable but, at the same time, the stock manager's assets with ambitious objectives and the desire to become the largest player in the investment bank.
As a result, in 2007, the UU managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more cash than any other bank in the world,
and as the investment bank, he joined the largest banks of the world.
That's what impressed me.
Hans Geiger, an ex-banker and a banker who had been teaching at the Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always introduced my students to the U.S. as a model of a good bank."
"You know what we know now, you can ask me how I could be so wrong."
He was really very wrong.
Only in 2007 it became clear that something is going on in the U.S.
In the middle of the year, the Executive Director, Peter Wuffley, who was considered an intellectual and, at the same time, a shining banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to figure out why he left.
The Bank's investment unit was trying to play the standard prize books and had to write billions.
You know, you don't, but the U.S. reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The Bank was really pleased to find investors - but investors from whom many banks would have recently declined - one very unexplained Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, so secret that even its name was not reported.
It was just the first hit.
In April 2008, there was a lot worse.
The Bank had to report on new billions of losses, and the President of the Board of Directors of Marcel Ospel, second on the level of salary of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, was withdrawn.
A disaster occurred in October 2008, due to the lack of investment during the financial crisis in the U.S., and the State had to save it.
The National Bank has purchased the U.S. toxic securities for an unlimited number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for a converted bond with a commitment to become a bank holder.
All Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic effects of large banks in the small country.
Finally, the 2007 profit balance was five times more than all Swiss production (see chart).
"We can't save the U.S. again," says banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first one.
A few months later, U.S. had capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States, and he said he was willing to transmit data to the state-of-the-art clients who, with the help of the bank, might have been tax-free.
The U.S. also agreed to pay $780 million from the payment of unreasonably income from the business in addition to the fine.
The UF thus acknowledged that it was an instrument for removal of taxes.
At the same time, U.S. lost what was always his advantage in combating rich customers, a secret undertaking.
After that, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the President of the Board of Directors subsequently withdrew, and
The client's money began to come out.
Within a few months, the bank lost trust in both main areas of its activities, in investing due to poor speculation and in managing assets as a result of assistance and promotion of tax removal.
And it just calmed down and it turned out that the U.S. was able to overcome the situation like this accident with an Affreyist-Trider.
One clearly is the risk management in the investment department as long as it does not work.
"The incident with Adoboli has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks is also convinced that he has no risk control tool.
That is, the long-term surveillance of Swiss bankers of the largest assets of the world is not an excessive risk, but security for money, whether or not the peace has been destroyed outside the Albanian Republic or not.
Swiss banks have become a symbol of non-exhaustive trust, such as Lindt and Sprüngli, which symbolize the frozen taste in chocolate.
The U.S. headquarters in Zurich has so far been in line with the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, just a little more.
It's just a classic.
The central bank office is located in Zurich, Bankhofstrasse, which leads from the main source to the Zurich Islands, in the vicinity of the snowcapped Swiss mountains.
The buildings are growing here, and the rent rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores of the Confirie Sprüngli type can be found here, such as Tiffany's.
Switzerland's banks have been here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the Credite Suiss Court and elite private banks, such as Julius Bur.
The heavy door leads to the U.S.
There's a lot of skin holes around the walls, and a lot of a big "Sief" sign.
The U.S. knows that his clients need trust.
But both the largest Swiss banks, U.S. and Credit Suisse, at some point have rejected Swiss banking concepts - or, as one of the few Swiss banks thinks, gave them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss banks, he's also working with two major banks.
He thinks the U.S. has become too big, especially in the investment bank, where the English are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss are adding something here.
"And if there is something that means they've been adapted to the English customs for a long time."
Indeed, the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank has changed the U.S., brought him the first large profits - and then Fisco - and no other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money as in the jungles of standard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
Catastrophe became evident on 15 October 2008.
"In the middle of the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people, the largest rescue operation in the history of the country has taken place," writes Lucas Hessig in his book Creole.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save a bank from bankruptcy.
How could that have happened?
If asked by Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly the U.S.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
A bank was built, which was already too big for little Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
This also helped to complement the two banks that were training the U.S., one being a rich but a moderate bank specialized in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not a rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalised investment banks have suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to steal a powerful college.
Two names are related to growth: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the U.S. Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, President of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolffley and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Vulfly, intelligent, humble and profoundly understandable model and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, has gone all the way up from the bank stage."
But Ospel was finally on Wolffley.
And Wolffley could make a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride leads to disappointment.
The U.S. officials are well aware of the meetings of the government that Wolffley has always repeated to the same Louzung - to attract Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was leading a tour board where banks were successful.
The U.S. wanted to fall on the top of this table.
He was able to make some of this way.
The U.S. was the biggest player in the trade in currency and public securities.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot, on the basis of which the banking terminology called "permanent income", was far behind the largest banks.
THE U.S.
To stop the storm, U.S. entered an apartment that was barely alive.
The bank itself and its base has invested in the US standard securities.
This has been developed in a large mechanism that has combined the valuable books based on American mortgages and sold them further, taking risks.
Even when other banks had long sought a way out of this process, the U.S.
"UBS bought it by summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already in fire," says banking analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to deal with how the bank’s attempts were made more difficult than it had been said at the outset.
Posts in the U.S. have become a child game with chairs and still are desperate.
There is almost an impossible task for anyone who will take the lead in this huge bank.
It must find a strategy for the bank that has returned back to all existing business models.
Geiger's banking analysis already has an idea - to give up the investment bank, focus on asset management and forget about its Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is obvious that investment activities need to be seriously concerned.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present its future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Swiss banker was considered in fact only as a temporary decision when the bank suddenly broke up with its predecessor, Grublem.
In the past, he was willing to show the character and now, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, the U.S.A. is headed on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-90s.
He's down 3500 jobs.
But that's not gonna be enough.
The U.S. needs a concept of development.
What's the U.S.?
How does he plan on making money?
These questions are the subject of Aksel Weber.
He publicly said only that he and his wife were looking for a room in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe are under the U.S. Fund Office
The current recession in Europe has weakened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.

This message hit American investors in scepsis. "We're not on the island, we depend on them," said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe would be speeding up and that banks would show further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffet was able to confirm these fears, and during the CBC interview, he said that it is still unusual whether Europe is strong enough to do everything that is needed to end the crisis.
Therefore, he believes that it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a few decades-old principle into the morass and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM amounted to more than ten billion dollars in the trade price of the company's shares was almost 1 per cent against the trend.

A thought - provoking storm fills the city
The game is considered a problem bird in many places, and experts say today that these very smart birds will no longer be able to escape from the city.
Some people like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and for centuries they have been part of the city's landscape, but people who complain about noise and noise are growing in many public places.
The solution to the bird's problem, however, has not yet been reached.
At the first symposium on combat, experts in the city of Ler, East Africa, claimed that the player could no longer be expelled from the city.
Specialists with all Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives claimed that the root of the problem in cities had been in migration of particularly protected players, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture had severely damaged traditional habitats.
Ohoda, expanding the construction and extraction of traditional trees, have made life difficult for birds.
The walls are protected.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west of Jevre, Dipholce, Ahime under Bremen and Lere there are large colonies of more than 600 parent couples.
A number of projects have been launched in Lere by an unconfirmed press title in 2005.
Critics described the bird’s hunting and slaughter of its wings as a particular evil.
The architect and Landshaft designer Werner Clever from Lera said:
The flow of water or wood wells has often had adverse effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kayzer from Lara, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are scattered, and large colonies are made and distributed to other areas."
Dispersion may be possible only in the form of exclusion from a number of hospitals, the homes of the elderly and schools.
"We have to live with them, to get rid of them, not a option."
In the absence of environmental problems in cities, Mr. Lera Wolfgang Keller says.
Compilation of the recruitment of birds from the protection of living areas and their return to other areas could be an exit.
"The information booths instead of Benzopiil" was a lozung proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Utt Maria Jurgens, who speaks for a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Yurgens was one of the founders of the Acherberg educational enemy route in Schlezwig-Golstein, where information on the lives of very thoughtful players is provided on the information tables.
The project is already in the interest of tourists.
Yurgens also expressed his opinion on complaints about noise produced by birds. "Sum sends a lot of information, and they have to tell each other everything else."
These birds have entered the legend, and players often use not only tools to control what they look like, but they do their own tools.
The behavior researchers at Cambridge University recently protested the action of the bird’s intelligence on four players.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they needed to be fed to get a prayer person.
Without special training, they knew the size and shape of the stone needed to cut the treasure.
In the second experiment, a more complex task had to be taken by the corresponding players.
The researchers put a little glass of prayer in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get the key.
But the researchers gave them bone fractures.
All four birds were used to make their nests and use their nests to trap the windshield by hand and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have already done this with the first attempt.

Mass killings - Human measurement
An intense and very good new book, Peter England, entitled "Crazy and Fear: Personal History of the First World War", begins with a long list of people who have died from heart disease.
Here is the advice to read: Take a careful look at this page and use it as a note.
You will meet these people very close to Mr. England, and this list of active persons will be your GPS, your mother at the moment when one of these men and women is said to be on the way and you will lose the war.
Mr. England is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is being represented by the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book that he wrote right now -- unusual, he describes it, exactly as "the anti-historic work."
It has few names, important treaties or significant battles; there is hardly a word, a list of journalists or a discussion of tactics and fighting techniques.
It's not just a book about what it was, it explains how many "books about what it looked like" it's about "feels, impressions, experiences and the state of mind."
The book "Crassot and Skull" shared the experience of 20 years of military years with more or less remarkable men and women, both on the front line, from schools and botanists to alpines, doctors, quick-assisters and servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone falls into a plane, loses his hand or his leg, comes with a mind or dies.
They live here as church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are burned at the time.
The book, Mr. England, is an escape from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the assumption that the First World War was only a heavy war on the West Front.
"Crassus and Skull" gave the panorama of other military theatres: Alp, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are wearing yellow wool; one of them meets the birth in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the moose.
It's a cool book, almost from the beginning.
War is covering the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina, which is a devastating disaster.
When the cannon is soon heard, and you're a woman and you're home with the children, will you stay in place or run away?
Or who else is it?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why we have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," said Mr. Englond, "is filled with ideas, assumptions, hopes, fears, binding ideas, theories of agreement, dreams, nightmares and listening."
"Crassus and Skull" is followed by the trial of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seaman of the German fleet of open sea.
Their stories are taken mainly from memorabilia, letters, and other material already published.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or confusing, but they are, above all, alive thanks to Mr. Englond's collection of small moments and dismal details.
Many of them are the prisoners and how they are treated.
Speaking of the history of the German school, he says, "Erasz, go to the school."
"The substitute coffee, the separate aluminum, the current resin, the bungalows, the wooden pungoras."
He's still talking about a rosary in Germany.
He describes “the meat of the pressed rice mixed with the wheat (and the dried falcon made from the tree); the tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes; the butter, by the wood. ”
He noted that there were “837 registered meat substitutes authorised for the production of the cobs and 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories add to honor and respect.
One American states in his mind the burden of violence and says of war: "You feel that, at the end of the day, it's what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, a dinner paper or a baseball player, and to claim that this shows and there's civilization, and there's no difference between you and your clothed rubies."
The British army, on the other hand, notes that he will soon die and no one will notice and burn.
"When a person humbles himself with the idea of self-sacrificing, he would like to think that this will happen before the public," he writes.
But it's the opposite, it looks awfully like a "man who's got a secret to it."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is disintegrated and new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become more and more economical," says Mr. Englond, "the wares."
He notes the arrival of the one who calls “a new species in the early century’s vestria: a beautiful and ideologically confident mass killer in a good dry suit that cuts the raffle, sitting behind the desk.”
People act in an unprecedented way: low-performance, as much as heroism.
Mr. Englond spoke of soldiers who were all trying to escape from prostitution in order to avoid service on the front.
"This is the only Greek expression that can be seen in the trade of a hormonal gentleman who was bought and sold by soldiers on the genitals in hopes of getting to the hospital," he writes.
“All the desperate people have caught him in the eye, which has often led him to a living blind.”
Mr. England, translated with Swedish Peter Gravs, was a soft but nylon-like man for his humanitarian mission.
In ten small scenes, he showed how the war "freed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to wonder why their leaders stop fighting them.
The best books on World War I were often misdirected, such as the "Great War and Modern Memory" of Paul Fassela or the Romans, such as "In the West Front without Change" and not historical works.
Mr. England's book is in this non-smoker pantheon.
His book has the most exciting ending that I can remember in the infamous literature.
I won't tell him.
But that is what he said from the book came to the page with a list of characters, took it out of your hand and put it in your pocket.
After the previous error - carefully calculated radius
Hundreds of police officers, some of them, were engaged in operations.
Nights from Monday to Tuesday were selected because there should be fewer people in Zuktiti Park at the time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few senior officers, the rest said they were attending.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of the incident, and his presence emphasized the importance of the operation by the Department of Police.
There could not be any comment on the repetition of such episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of a list of gas against protesters, which contradicted the department's rules and caused the hurricanes of public sympathy to the occupying Powers.
So, two weeks after planning and training, the police release from the protesting Zukotti Park began.
The authorities were prepared to observe the development of occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis studies were conducted on the Isle of Randles, calculated on the South.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called inconsistencies - counter-terrorism measures that provide for the rapid transfer of large number of police - with the view of Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of East River.
The order of entry into the park came in "the last minute" - he told the source that was marked by orders in which the task was only referred to as "training".
"The few cops I know and the people I've been calling on didn't say they're going to Zuktti Park," said the man who spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to South Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for safety was a lesson that the city had taken.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but they left before hundreds of protestors who had been hiding within the designated time frame, listening to these plans.
On Tuesday, police officers from various police units, including the forces from the districts, were used to control criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost at work, would come and leave the park during the day, which would take 1 hour at night for the time to arrive.
"It was right to do this when the least people were in the park," he said.
The rescue service cars with projectors and speakers were gathered at the Pike-Slip and Franklin Rusvelt-Drive, around the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The projector and earlier recorded statements made by the speakers seem to have destroyed many protestors.
When the officials of the administrative units entered the park in their heavy winds, many protestors simply collected their goods and left.
The police reported that the halls did not go until 1:45 a.m., giving protestary time to collect things.
Other police groups, according to the eyewitnesses, were gathered at the perimeter to get inside if arrests were required in the park.
Journalists in the park stopped leaving.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the Department of Police, said that this was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they did not let them see how the police were operating and that the police were being rude to them.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras at Cherch Street, along the west end of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of personal protestants, including bags, plastic bags and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department's teams went after her, collecting what had been broken.
Some of the protesters who refused to leave were excommunicated, and photographs of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protestors took positions around the kitchen camp, in the center of the park.
Some set up a barracide, and the police went inside, literally arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter were shooting at each other's hands.
And two men dragged themselves into the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to prevent the closures, rescue personnel were called.
No arrests were held in the park about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed approximately 75 minutes ago, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority had been arrested for "public violations and arrests," he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department, was the highest position.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the Swiss Department's police department, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "he didn't run the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Side Street, if necessary.
Constructions were placed in Cortland Street, in the north of the park, and in the Pine Street, in the south.
The observers saw how the police expanded the perimeter even further beyond the South Pole border.
At one point, observers saw as a group of police, many with shielded people were further exasperated.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred in the south of the park.
About 5 o'clock in the south of Pain Street, one of the protestors jumped over a police car, while the others said that they had aired out of the police station.
At some point out of the crowd, he flew a fan box.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Professional union of service staff school in the city court of release
A trade union representing hundreds of staff members of schools that lost seats last month plans to be brought to the city court in the middle, claiming that exemptions were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the non-proportional influence of schools where poor students were taught.
The trial is probably the latest, available to the District Council 37 professionals who are trying to abolish exemption.
Sixty-two school assistants, co-ordinator of work with parents and other employees who were among the lowest paid workers in the city lost their jobs on 7 October because the leaders of the union called for a political response to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by working groups to close the gap in the budget in the past.
City officials categorically denied this charge.
At the hearings of the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the exemptions were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the Council members said that there was no indication in the budget that the school support staff would be released.
The representatives of the 37 Environment Council reported that they had been informed of claims by the Department of Education that they had filed an inquiry against him; a press conference would be held in the middle to announce the formal submission of the request to the Supreme Court of the State of Manhattan.
In the search for respondents, Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department will be listed as eight temporary fired workers, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, the representative of the City Department of Justice, said that the city had not seen a request and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the trade union focused on a number of exemptions from schools in poor urban areas to support the claim for unfair treatment, claiming that the poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He indicated that while there were no exemptions from Staten Island, 17 auxiliary schools in the Upper East Side or Tribeki schools had lost their places in the 23nd district of Braunsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had arrived in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked in the 36 free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the survey says: “These are not areas of stable parents who can earn money to pay for the budget.”
P.S. The 36 budget was estimated at 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the method of financing additional funding for each poor student attending school.
The trade union also claims that the school director may have been misled by the language of notification allowing the coordinators to work with their parents.
The notification used the word “extraordinary” although the word “extraordinary” was often used when the teacher from the school's payroll was placed on the list of available workers who were paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six co-ordinators working with parents were fired," said the blackout, "and not just translated."
Mission of the End, Congress ready for the Libya Agreement
The Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol Valley seem to be willing to finally agree on something about the resurrection in Libya.
All that had to be done was to get away, old dictator Muamar Caddafi was taken to the ground and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider the resolution issued by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John Mackein (Republication, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who commend the Libyans for their success and the American army for "responsibility".
"The purpose of this resolution is to bring back the respect of the people of Libya when they begin to restore their country," Kerry said.
“This is a confirmation of their support for their democratic tensions by both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but not one discussion on Libya was easy.
In this summer both parties were replaced by the White House on a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American army in NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McKain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of the two parties and did not fall to the vote in the Senate.
However, on the same day when the bill was passed in the Chamber of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support the proposal to finance the American operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some kind of legislative purity - when Congress was sufficiently scattered to criticise Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad, to actually pick the soil out of its foot.
Post-consumptions of the Congress
In August, Tripoli became the Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Caddafi was killed.
NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “is commended by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and unquestionable stability in the quest for freedom” and thanks both men and women to the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unaccompanied courage and professionalism.
The resolution also “recognises the national interest of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition to democracy in Libya”.
Are new measures fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or distributed by legislators as the June Bill?
In response to the latest version, Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Committee's republics.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the House of Representatives should vote this week for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every republic and for some democracy in the Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives of Bob Gudlat (Republication, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or on anything else that will be brought to the plenary vote of the Congress on this call.
Other legislators have not been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they have not tried.
Guatemala ' s amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments affecting the broad range of issues raised in this House.
Some have doubled -- the same bill has been introduced into the House of Representatives and the Senate -- others have been minor differences.
There are at least 15 amendments to the budget balance only in the Chamber of Representatives and a number of other "control over federal expenditure".
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors - mainly freshly elected republics who wish to clean up their sum - the opportunity to admit that they have "caused" such a proposal.
The budget control act, which was passed in August, requested the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment on a balanced budget.
In March 58, the senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress, while members of the House of Representatives of José Serrano (Democrat, New York) want to cancel the limitation in two terms for the President.
The Congressman Jessie L. Jackson Youth (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, in addition, the right to quality education and health.
The amendment banning single marriages has been proposed for many years as well as for another ban on flagging.
Some legislators also wish to permit the repeal of federal laws if they are opposed by two thirds of the states.
As members of the Congress tried to propose amendments, they were moving not faster than in the past years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments and 110 introduced 66.
This step will be taken in comparison with the early 1990s when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they did not get more than they are now.
The last amendment adopted - 27 - was approved in 1992, but was introduced to Congress in 1789.
"Voice, but not winning," said Giffords in his first television interview after trying.
Ten months after the armed man shot into it at a public meeting in Tusone, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel Monday morning, accompanied by a bride from the boat show "Solence returns" and said that she wanted to say more welcome than to return to Congress.
In the "20/20" programme, E-bi-Si-News and Diane Soier, Giffords worked on the proposals and needed assistance on the move.
The program showed her difficult way to recover after the trauma caused by a stroke that broke the head and broke the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the Chamber of Representatives and made a three-month vote on the draft demarcation bill.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, in which six and 13 people were killed, Gifford fell asleep, laughed and kissed, and called his recovery "hard."
About Soier, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of an hour's special release "20/20", which showed the inspiration of the new book "Gebbi: The History of Men and Hope".
The Spectacular spoke of the restoration of Gifford after the shooting on 8 January.
On the video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a head and a long shoulder.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband’s request.
A few months later, we'll see how Giffords is sitting in a chair, and the physicists teach her how to do simple things.
Get your head off.
Take off your shoes.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords made the second word "toss", please change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by E-Bi-si shows that music played a central role in Gifford's health: We see how the congressman sings together with the doctors "The Girls just want to enjoy" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Soier Giffords, who spent two hours a day in the proceedings, he said he would not remember the day of the trial.
Her husband said that he read the Giffords article in the shooting newspaper on March 12 when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who were killed then.
The suspect, George Li Lafner, is detained in the Missouri prison and is subjected to forced treatment in waiting for the court.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Soyer.
"Sorry, heavy, heavy."
Once during her recovery, Kelly Soyer said, "I won."
"And I said, "Gobby, you're not a winner," said Kelly.
You're just killed.
And you'll walk through it, you'll wake up and get back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more sadness than respect
The event was a holiday at Wall Street, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock burned a ballad of helplessness, disappointment and loss.
A number of hundreds of soldiers, mariners, pilots, and seafarers were stationed around it.
The audience in the smukinga appealed to him.
"For military officers, they looked like heroes," said David Salzman, who organized a wedding collection of money.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also the then chairperson of the Chiefs Committee, admirated Mike Mallen, saw the role of the second army.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted it better.
I know that.
But in fact, it wasn't respect, it was a pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the slight relationship between the army and often the same, sometimes raised by the American public.
The soldiers are thanking them for their sacrifices.
But thanks are worth it, the military are speaking.
The public is more guided by the way it deals with people in the form of mourning.
"We're not all victims," said Brigadier General Shawn B. McFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and is soon on his way to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive topic for soldiers who do not want to look ungrateful or incorrigibly at the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger of the return troops in Vietnam has been much worse in recent years.
As a result, most of the complaints are silent and only between war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from war on the seaport, Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that people who were not from the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration because they had been robbed of their possessions and had been in exile.
Others will wonder if there is no hidden "under a mask of gross evil." Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to high government post in Washington.
While looking for work, he said he felt that some of the interviewees had asked carefully whether he could hold back the stress of responsibility in Washington immediately after the war.
Kenshn remembers when he said to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you should think about the negative effect."
The inhumanity experienced by the military is partly caused by the American disparity of war.
Victorys in the field of combat are often granted thanks from a country that has a little sign of the army and sees little direct benefits from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was perfectly in World War II," said General Lieutenant General David Berno, who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Rather, the renewed policy and public focus on the deep suffering of the soldier.
The military assesses the number of advances they have made, the number of partners they have lost, or the extent of loss.
The army is facing increasing pressure from the parties to combat rape
On this week, historical hearings should be held whether 28 men and women will be sought against the army on charges of non-violent rape.
If not, hundreds of holes will be constructed along the following lines.
Elizabeth Lyman, a number of the first class of 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy, was raped by her servant on the night she was admitted.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her camp at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after she had been married to another man and met a man with a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could get her to the room to drink.
"It was a beautiful bottle," said Lyman.
But Tehasa's impetuousness has turned her back on her fears.
I thought, no, he was 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instinct at the time."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came back to her, beat her and raped her, she said.
On this week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military personnel will be forced to wait for the decisions of the court on the historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether they will go to the court to seek out the former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumfeld.
It is claimed that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with a wide range of military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, counsel Susan Berk of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 prisoners, but increased to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men who all claim that they have been raped or threatened by sexual violence on the part of their staff and that the army has not properly investigated, prosecuted, or provided appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berk says she's focusing on the military's superiors because the problem starts with them.
"Armiya is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the culture of violence?
Berk also says that since February about 400 other victims have been associated with it, many of whom can participate in future demands.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the pillars in this case, the whole class of eggs in one basket, so to say, it will open a lot of cases if it is necessary to support pressure.
The Ministry of Defence's defence team under the leadership of the Federal Prosecutor, Nila McBrida, took steps to end the case.
The case-law documents received by Newsweek reveal the protection strategy - mainly because former or current soldiers cannot claim the military for the damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine of the Supreme Court of 1950, Doc. Ferres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by the persons serving in the military.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk of the military service of hostages,” says the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women have been officially forbidden to participate in the war, this section exists only in words: modern wars often have a clear front line.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers play an increasingly important role, particularly in contacts with local women in the area of combat.
As a result, 150 women soldiers were killed during the period between the two wars - two thirds of them in battle.
The army is also about to become a modern one, says Berk.
She is not alone in her struggle; three others are prepared in addition to her search.
The Veteran Legal Service Seminar at the Jeelian Legal School is preparing a case against four major military academys for the promotion of the female atmosphere.
A separate non-commercial combination of American veterans of the war in Vietnam is preparing a search for the army, in which the diagnosis of “manual changes” that are being carried out by victims of violence to remove them from service, is a common phenomenon, such as Ana Bhagwati from the human rights group of the Organization of Women ' s Armed Forces.
Its group sought in December against the Office of Veterans, accusing it of discrimination against the treatment of pensions by persons who claimed that sexual violence had been threatened during the service.
Nine separate draft legislation proposed by a number of measures was introduced at the Congress by the Group of Senators and members of the Chamber of Representatives of the two parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported by the Ministry of Transport for Prevention and Sexual Violence.
However, it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to its assessment, the figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of cases known to the court were reported twice as much as in the civil justice system.
In Berk's case, they are called the first attacks on them in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she complained of violence in the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of rape 11 times by police, doctors and commanders.
She collected evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker was found on her face.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before the judges at the hearing during which she was asked if she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused, who was finally justified.
"I remember the day the deed was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was born now - I ran away from the court hall with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric office, and when I went out, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a trial over him, it was a trial for me."
Lyman was ordered to turn to a military psychiatrist who, in the end, diagnosed a change in personality that made her inappropriate for service.
In January 2010, she was released with a negative wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case has been brought forward by Lyman and her research partners is a complex question, says John Terley, professor of law at the University of Law, George Washington.
But he says, "I think they are going ahead."
There is also a doctrine that is critical of the time when it has occurred.
I've been critical of Dr. Ferres for the rest of my life.
The army has remained for decades, as it does not have the incentives and the means to hold responsibility.
He adds, "There are a lot of odds against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when ordinary people want to fight.
If they fail to listen, Berk, a lawyer of the press, will collect hundreds of others for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is done," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
There's eyes in the wall: How the researchers study you at Facebook
Before becoming a new person of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bryvik was a normal guy who expressed his anti-immigrance views on the Internet.
On Monday, Brewik, who was found to have committed mass murder in Norway in July, where 77 people lived, appeared on his first open trial hearing.
Although Brewik was able to act alone, he was not far away from the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, along with millions of nationalists who support the legal groups in the social networks.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can you find them?
It's easy. We just need to get to Facebook.
"We understood that it was very difficult to address it," said Jamie Bartlett, the author of a recently published report on the European cyber population of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The storage of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to identify the required demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketing has been done for several years.
The Bartletta team discovered millions of fans of right groups throughout Europe and then posted a publication to them, but instead of showing a new group or a digital product, the announcement suggested that the user should conduct an examination on the level of their education, on violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants were able to examine 14 extreme rights parties in 11 European countries - not even leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett says.
Some results are not so clear: online right-wing groups are mostly young men of sex who are under-immigrant immigration.
But suddenly, "those who engage in their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who are just heading for the monitor."
DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and politicians use a website to study everything in the world, from health to social trends that are expressed in Lakes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users added to the average three entries per day, the Facebook “super-active information” is a research bomb, increasing the number of scientific articles called the site at 800 per cent in the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook has been able to study people who can't get on the street with a block.
"It would be very difficult to identify people from the British National Party if you wanted to examine them."
"You should enter the party, and they would never accept you," Bartlett says.
"Fiesbuck's off all this. You're calling him directly."
Others say that this website could identify and examine social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of Wisconsin University, Madison, and her colleague showed that students who discussed their drinking habits at Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who heard about it.
It must be assumed that students' associations, for example, their community teachers, could monitor the website and intervene to help a student who is too often updating drinking statistics.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitry Christakis, Lieutenant Moreno and Director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute of Seattle.
"We have found ways to identify children from a risk group who would otherwise not be identified."
Facebook also constantly draws information about its users in different ways.
The data processing team worked on the relationship statistics and the date of the Holy Valentine, as well as the National Index of Happiness (mainly using information available only to them, the cyberspace champions insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data available to the public for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play in Scrabble with another thousand miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what happens when Facebook users become participants of research that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for the conduct of offline research, online data are available.
"I don't think that many users would have thought that the researcher could watch their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London lab of knowledge he conducted in 2006 with the use of the public student pages in Facebook.
"As long as they represented themselves, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline has no guarantee that the research object is too honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to determine the amount of information in the profile and on the user's page.
"What you're talking about on Facebook, and what you're doing outside of Facebook, are two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite the years of his work in the field of technological research, Selvin believes that the blockage and manual are still the best research tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and society with real people," he says.
“Social studies are supposed to be social, and most of the social studies are still offline.”
"The cold and inhuman": Anders Bering Bryvik will appear before the court first
Anders Bering Brewick, a man who met in the organization of a double assault, who had committed 77 lives in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter "opposite" during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian opposition movement and the Russian Tampliers of Norway," he said in front of 500 in the court room.
"I hate the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports pluralism."
"I admit my actions, but I don't admit my guilt."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim stopped Brewik at the time of this monologue, because he "does not want to give Brewik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Brewik, who had made his previous written address to relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nasheim also ordered the police to keep Brawik under custody for another 12 weeks, forbade him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and registrations for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives visited.
Some came to hope to see Brewik in the eye, others to be convinced that he was under the cover.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said the Norwegian NRK, one of the survivors of the Uthai.
"It wasn't easy, but personally it became a little easier for me, after I saw and heard the suspect."
The man in the dark and blue of the Braille glass kept calm and professionalism throughout the entire audience and looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite the strange idea that he was part of a major “controversial” movement, the judge decided that he was not the same, and said that there was no evidence of what he was doing with the communiqué.
Some may find it comforting to know that on 22 July attacks were directed at the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the anger and confusion that is now felt by all nations.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but that's not it," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much better if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview showing in the theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Founder of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple fans can start the biggest open-up in a newly discovered interview, which they remembered in advance of preliminary indications on the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, the designer, the dreamer, and he thought he was a hippie, but he was also an adequate organizer and modernist of the manufacturing process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from "the disease of thinking that the really great idea is 90 per cent of the work... [not] the great idea of the large product distinguishes a huge amount of professional work".
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Trimf series on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more time with Jobs for a unique period of time.
By then, about 10 years have passed since Jobsa was released from Apple, and he has already worked at his new computer company NeXT in waiting for a massive Internet recovery.
While the small part of Kringley's interview was used in Nerdah, he says that the original interview was missing during transport.
Only after the death of Jobs, a full VHS copy was found in the registries garage.
This removed material, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The lost interview that takes place in the Landmark Theatres in this middle and fourth.
For a man who knows his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs here seems extremely willing to expose his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And amazingly smart.
At four different points, there are a large range of interviews between questions and answers -- meditations for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly raises his thoughts to be more accurate.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism emerges to the surface, where he seems to be an issue of Kringley, which makes him move faster to matters or events of greater importance.
In the afternoon before the fall of Pixara, Episcopal and Heiphones, the interview was a little worse when Jobs assessed what he saw, what various companies were doing was true and dishonest, and offered his own vision of future information technologies.
One thing is to read about the death estimates of Jobs' work, but there's something that's hurt and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here, a very worrying dream of a small size.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant conclusions of the Poeterian interview:
About how he learned to manage business:
"For all time in business, I kept asking, "Why do you do this?" And the answers that you're constantly getting, "Oh, that's just what it does."
No one knows why they're doing what they're doing, no one's thinking really much about business.
That's what I knew.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to rationalise the record in Apple.
The complex way of recording the costs, often starting with the standard costs, which were taken from the pool and then worked out with the "off", created an automated structure, which guaranteed that they could track business costs down to the smallest ones.
Looking up Daddy:
Jobs is detailed in his description of the "Sine Box", which he acquired with Steve Vozník, a device that enabled people to get off the phone effectively and call on large distances free of charge.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobs' office here described the son of a ship as an act of devotion to the authority.
He explains how he and Voznjak tested the boat by using the phone-automatic, ordering the conversation and then joining one AT&T network until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the ground floor once and you've called on the phone, and it's been a minute later in the neighbor's phone," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we had adopted was that we could take over something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both knew a little bit, but we could get rid of the little thing that could control the big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think it could ever happen to Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one significant outcome that he and Voznánk had practically met, calling on the Vatican through the blue boat in the night and asking for a telephone call from Papu, where all the efforts were to copy Henry Kissinger.
When several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two were laughing right before Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
On the love of technology (and the cold call of Bill Hulet):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hullett on the phone and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs received an early training in the Hulett-Pacard.
"It had a strong effect on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of the company and how well they were dealing with their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP staff visiting the research laboratories at Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer".
He was the size of a chamodon, he had a small monitor with an e-mail tube, and I fell in love with him.
I often lived in HP as a teenager and ran around that car and wrote for it.
On improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs interviewed about the creation of new products at the airport.
At the end of his career, when he was about to sell a mounting fee, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working all 30 days in the credit, he had to think about the collection and the delivery of the equipment.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the heated disputes... they called me that it would take five years [to get a mouse worth $300], and I was standing on top of it, and went up, and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About major energy-loss companies:
Long before he led Apple's recovery, Jobs accurately predicted that many industry leaders would fail to see the situation and lose control over their market share.
"Let me guess, you work in IBM or Xerox, so you do a better copy or a printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company won't be more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [the type of people] who come to the company’s leadership and people who are making the product are drawn out of the decision-making areas.
The genes of the product, which led to this monopolistic position, are impressed by people who have no understanding of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times more, it could be a 90-h microsof...
They've got a defeat.
About innovation as an art form:
"The great idea of a great product separates a huge amount of experimental work... when you turn a big idea, it changes and grows."
You know a lot about her thinness.
There are compromises you need to make -- some things you can't stop making electronics, glass, work or entertainment.
You need to keep in mind 5,000 ideas -- these concepts, joining them all together...
In the end, it's all about taste, it's all about trying to say the best that people have ever done and then trying to make it into what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists burn.
It was always a shame to buy big ideas.
Part of what had been done by the so-called Macintosh was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists and historians who became the best information technology professionals in the world.
If there were no information technologies, they would do things that would be boring in other areas.
Scully and Thomas are engaged with opponents of the Health Act until the court considers the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met at closed doors to discuss the political issue, he would hear a copy of the Act on the Health of President Obama, his two judges, Antonina Scalia and Clarence Thomas, hailed the meal of a sponsored legal firm that would open the case before the Supreme Court.
This happened last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One of the issues on the agenda was a request supported by 26 States that were inquisitively opposed to the review of health adopted by the Congress last year by a law that united the conservatives of all nations.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the roundtable debate was expected in March 2012 at 5 1/2 hours, and the outcome would soon become a compromise in the presidential run, which would be at the most slow until a judicial decision was announced.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law must be abolished, most recently, will be Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Prosecutor General at the time of President George W. Bush.
Clémenta's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two companies that helped sponsor the annual community of federalists, a long-standing group that consistently opposed conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored food was one of the trade associations that violated the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who had a great financial interest in the cause of hardship.
Obed was held in Washington, D.C., a few hours after the trial.
He attended, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans of the Senate and a well-known opposition to the Health Act.
The early guests at dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have visited the activities of the Federalist community for many years.
And that doesn't contradict ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were to comply, they might fall under the principle of the 4C Code, which states: “The judge may visit the welfare activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a rapporteur, a guest or mentioned in the programme of such activities.”
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to companies with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
"It is a flagrant violation of ethics and the absence of the code that contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains convinced of the same rules that are applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
“The judges have been exaggerating and having taken a formal action to collect money with lawyers who are now under trial.”
Their disclosure and assistance in the collection of money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scully and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say that they are very often mixing court cases with groups of the kind of federalist community.
And Thomas' wife, Jenny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Furthermore, the conservators claim that this is an ethical issue with regard to Judge Elena Kagan, not to Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal service in Obama's administration when the first court disputes against the law were brought to court at the first instance.
Its criticisms required that Kagan refuse to listen to the case, because she was too involved in the protection of the law at that time in order to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record order of 18 billion aircraft
The Emirates Air Company ordered 50 wide-frequency lines Boeing 777 and possibly 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a transaction amounting to over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company receives orders for 50 units of its production.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft builder, and the transfer price for all 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold of future aircraft orders.
In the forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that in the next 20 years the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion.
Boeing announced in these outputs his largest dollar equivalent order on commercial aircraft - 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from Emmirates Airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to purchase 20 more aircraft at a total of $26 billion, declared Boeing at the Duba Airport 2011.
Last Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which could be significantly better fuel and passenger-friendly.
The excess cost of six aircraft would amount to more than $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Nile Diora.
“The quality of these particular buyers is quite high.”
Many neighboring countries have power over oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but also an increase in fuel prices, which usually harm airlines, as one of the biggest items of costs is not so much lost, because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important, just as they are less likely, unless other airlines refuse the order of aircraft when prices increase, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Order of Emmirates strengthens Boeing's leadership on the market of wide-floating aircraft and helps prevent the attempt by Airbus SAS to achieve its ownership with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the airport took place four months after Airbus stated that he would give up the weight of the largest A350, which was opposed to 777-300ER times.
It raised doubts in order to increase the cargo load after the buyers had to increase the volume and duration of the flight.
Boeing Co shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexico President's sister apparently missed the election in Michowana
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers assisted Fausto Valeho from the IRP in the pre-election run.
The sister of President Felipe Calderona seems to have not applied to Governor Michoacán in the time of the bitter civil elections, and she said on Monday that drug dealers helped to turn the gang into one of her opponents.
As a preliminary result, the leader in the run for the West Governor is called Fausto Valeho of the Institute-Revolving Party, or the IRP.
"The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, causes concern not only for Michocana but also for the entire country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the next day after the resurrection vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... they caught the noise for the vote, put obstacles... and prevented people from voting" for the IRP.
The IPR managed Mexico for seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
It is preparing a return and victory in Michowana is an important step in this attempt.
IPR hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Valeho, it seems, only a few days ago, Calderon, who was leading the ratings until the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or a PND led by her brother, refused to acknowledge Valecho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DPR, which now belongs to the Governor's chair, has come to a third -- a serious threat to the separate and ineffective lefts before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aurelos also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Valeho, former president of the capital of Moreli, denied access to drug dealers and invited other candidates to accept the results.
In Michigan, drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines were held for a long time.
It was the native state of President Calderona, and he chose Michocan to launch a military operation against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence continues.
Mr. PND was killed a week before the election, when he attacked Luis Maria Calderon, and several candidates were out of the local pre-election race because of fear.
For the IRP, however, as the elections in Michocan would be terrible, the victory of the driving force of the party will be won.
The man who was to represent the IRP in the presidential run, Enrique Penna Nut, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valeho and said, "I think this victory should be very exciting next year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has been committed to India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that will continue to increase the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, head of the ABR office in Manila, said that two of the fastest growing economies should "do all they can" to speed up the recovery of the currency block through the assistance of the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “inexhaustible” and said that Asian financial assistance on the side of European leadership and resources could help to avoid long-term decline in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe choose from the crisis is useful," he reported during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be vulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, this must be done with obligation."
The European Monetary Union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's loan funds have grown threatening, and both the Prime Minister and Greece have withdrew.
The long-term crisis in Europe created a fear that it could bring the world economy back to its resuscitation, and called on leading economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. One predicted that any Asian aid would be carried out through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of the EU financial assistance fund, would provide a great deal of strength in the negotiations with Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India does everything possible" to help the eurozone, as her own economy now survives the decline of exports and the reduction of foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unsatisfied," he said.
"We have tremendous challenges, and we must maintain high levels of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our young people and girls."
Others argue that India ' s developing economy has no reason to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide European assistance to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live at $2 a day or less.
"At some point they know that the Greeks go to retirement for 50 years and spend their holidays at sea, and that will not be accepted well," he said.
Li Howell, the Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to contain Greek numerous and well-paid public-sector workers on the labour market in organized, waste-intensive enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. One said that the eurozone crisis threatened "greatly direct consequences" throughout Asia.
ABB's 7.5% economic growth forecast in Asia in 2011/12 is now being addressed with "degradable risks" due to threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets had to develop " emergency plans " to protect themselves from the decline and significant flows of capital from their economies.
Fears of the Pentagon on potential reduction in defence costs
The Minister for Defence Leon Pannetta struck the situation on Monday at the convention, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and cause the financial core reaction from the Pentagon to the field of war in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The pentagon has already been reduced to $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now feared that additional reductions of 600 billion or more could be avoided if the convention could not reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the ministry," the Panetta reported in a letter to the senators of the Republic of John McCain, Arizona, and the Republic of Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of the Congress to adopt a budget agreement and resulting from the so-called section had begun a total reduction of 23 per cent and the end of many new projects.
“The tremendous reduction, which is so immeasurably applied, makes most of our shipbuilding and construction impossible—you cannot buy three-fourths of ships or buildings—and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” wrote the Senators.
"We also have to kill many of our state workers and, as the reduction will be done so quickly, we have almost to kill the state to achieve the goal."
“These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and seriously harm the preparedness.”
The cuts in the final accounts are affected by the military, Pannetta said.
" While military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sector, the military achievements are seriously affected by the serious deterioration in the main budgets," Pannett warned.
“Contract personnel will be reduced to conclude the withdrawal of contracts and oversight treaty that supports the army.”
“Situated staff will be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be broken.”
Two senators wrote Panette 10 days ago asking for details of the possible effects of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“The Ministry of Defence will follow the sequence of the United States as the world military leader.”
"We are constantly opposed to these dramatic actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening when they announced the letter of the Pannetta.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we're supposed to be. "
"Section is a threat to the interests of national security of the United States, and this cannot happen."
Whether the letter of the Pannetta or the latest warnings of the senators will be delivered to the budget compromise or the call for the release of the Pentagon from reductions will be made visible later.
The Panetta was absolutely honest with potential reductions, although it had come to work under the direction of the Pentagon after many years of budgetary expertise in the Congress and the White House and was aware that it was in a difficult election.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew an unusual picture of what could be followed by an army with a face but without a core.
"It's a ship without seamen."
"It's a piece without a ball."
"It's the wing of a plane without sufficient pilots."
"It's a brigade tiger, army with kasarms, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her opening remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an insatiable battle spirit, a bad readiness and unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In the annex to his letters to McKain and Graham Pannett, he drew new details about how “reducing significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously restricting our ability to be the first to deploy and react to the world; and endangering future war operations”.
And the Panetta said that some of the biggest armed projects could be faced with obstacles, including those already tested, and some only at early stages of planning.
This list includes a single striker F35, a new bomber planned, a ballistic submarine ship of a new generation, a new coastal zone, and a new ground vehicle, which Army and the Navy are required to replace the Hammer.
The cessation of further development and testing of F35 may cost $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital step towards improving and countering the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Understand Lies
The view of the last chapters shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidate in the presidential office of the Republic of Herman Cain was accused of sexual harassment by several women; each party accused another of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania has been accused of lying, as they have secretly concealed that a football coach has raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicola Sarcosi was a poet when, on a microphone, U.S. President Barako Obama said that Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanijah was a liar.
The lie breaks down careers and destroys countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitor Anthony Weiner had betrayed himself, denying his findings that there was no clear evidence.
The former candidate of President John Edwards was charged with financial engineering during the campaign involving the accumulation of foreign links.
Again, none of the people living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was lying about his sexual relations with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
The history of fraud at school and college is an ordinary matter.
There were cases when the teacher gave the students an answer to the tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
The teachers who must learn the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
What is the amount of lies we're dealing with?
During one day, as studies show, you can smoke from 10 to 200 times.
A significant part of this is now supposed to be a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that unknown people were three times the first 10 minutes of each other's acquaintance.
The identification of lies or lies is necessary for every skill, both for personal and professional purposes.
In contrast to the room game, it seems to say, the charms, where the call is to be called "Science!", is a serious source of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities involving comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old lies have been distributed.
The liers look in the eye.
They don't always stop, they call, they're beautiful or they're tired.
It should not be concluded that lies are difficult to detect and difficult to spread.
An experienced lier can come to the truth by observing the structure of approval, mining, question structure and temporary characteristics.
I've spent several years studying scientific discoveries in the broad and constantly growing knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to focus on our complex world, especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, reconciliation, negotiation or management.
Good people are able to read aloud to others by making them feel uncomfortable, controlling their own emotions, and feeling excited about how others view them.
We know from the study that extravagance is more likely than introverts, that men are more likely to lie about themselves, whereas women are more likely to protect others from feelings that women are less likely to be angry with their partners than women (not the lie they say, most often).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty when they deceive you.
How do you understand? Is anyone lying?
First, look at the normal behavior of your object.
It is called “the definition of the status of origin”.
This will help provide a starting point for further assessment of changes.
Look at your object's position, smile, voice characteristics.
It would be good for you to know if a person is always wearing his feet in a normal way, and then you do not make unfair accusations when you see the wearing of his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then seek out groups of false and false acts.
You are referring to these groups as beautiful flags, not as evidence of fraud.
Mistakers can fix the top part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, push out, change their back in a certain way, or demonstrate "failure after an interview" — an increased rise in ease and change of position when all complex issues are behind.
Follow-up is often false to the end of the investigation to simply look at it after the interview.
So, pay attention to your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson had been betrayed and used in the past, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her search throughout the country.
Depressive people may also use distance, saying, "I had no sexual relations with this woman ... Ms. Levinski" or to repeat a complex question completely.
The most typical vertebral indicators are barely catchable.
Someone can use the "qualification language" when answering the complex question, "Horocho... I'm telling the truth... how much I know... how much I know."
This is more emotional than actual, and is often a beautiful flag.
There is no magic device to detect lies, but to have the ability to detect deception.
These skills will increase the chances of each one not to become a victim of professional and personal exploitation.
The oil pipeline construction plan needs to be revised after the United States threat has been approved
A few days later, after Obama's administration threatened to suspend the approval of planned oil pipelines from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which provoked the anger of trade unions, but calmed the environmental defenders -- a company that was trying to build oil, it claimed that it would be willing to review the project to resume its work on it.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would collect planned naphtha from the environmentally sensitive area of the Pescan Holms in Nebraska and be assured that the project would still be approved.
The company called for this decision at a press conference in the capital of the state of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas says that the company remains confident that it will finally receive approval for oil pipelines, even with other routes.
This was followed by a statement made by the State Department last week that it would reject a draft decision at the federal level until it examined the possible new routes that did not affect the area of the Peschen Valleys of Nebraska and Ogala, the vast underground reservoir.
"It's a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Li Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the Department of State will, most recently, depend on decision-making by 2013, following elections in the following year, although the authorities have rejected that policy.
In a written statement last week, both called for a decision by the State Department ' s call and supported it.
Petroleum of 1,700 miles shall be extended from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Albert's province to the Texas oil-producing plant.
To do this, he needs six states.
It is hated by environmental defenders, but it is loved by trade unions, which are expected to build around 20,000 oil-related jobs.
However, the lawmakers against the plan are considering a draft to speed up the move from the Pescan Valley and Ogallah waters, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department's study on environmental impact showed that the project would only have limited negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had commissioned a separate review procedure on two issues.
One is a lobbyist named TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant at the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008.
Secondly, it was the choice of a company that was hired to conduct a preliminary study that was inappropriate, as it was related to TransCanada.
Patty LaBell was brought to court for calling the baby to rest from fear.
The New York family claims that the disco-dive Patty Labell began to fight in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, threatening their younger daughter to such a degree that it got scared.
"Lady Marmalade" executive Tirad threatened 18-month Geneva Monk so strongly that she transferred "a change of personality, disintegration of sleep" and "a strong fear of strangers," said her family to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on 10 November last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, a nurse, Rosana, and Geneva were on their family trip.
As long as Kevin Monk drove the car, Rosanna Monk landed in the building lobby at Riverside with their luggage, it was Geneva.
Rosana Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter in half a minute.
"Someone came after me and said, "You know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to take her away," she said.
LaBelle was heartbroken by the response of a pregnant woman.
"She got aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosana Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came to light and began to use drugs -- the word for C and the word for F -- on raised tons...
She had a bottle of water, and she started drinking water from the bottle on me.
She said that in Geneva there was an outbreak of osteoporosis.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you've done with my daughter," said the mother.
LaBelle was born to a mother, who still held Geneva, and her companion had to hold her in a waiting car, said Rosana Monk.
The little girl cried so much that she touched her, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note requesting an apology, but she didn't get an answer.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBell do not respond to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family lawyer Sam Devis said that he took the case freely and that the family plans to sacrifice any money that will be received for the welfare of children with a sick hand.
"The goal is to keep Patty Labell responsible for his actions," said Davis.
“This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially in relation to a child's garden teacher with an 18-month-old child on his hands.”
Climate problems have brought an end to the economy
During the first year of the rule of Mario Lopes in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign funding decreased and the economy was weakened.
2011, which will take place in the economic history of Sinaloa as related to the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Valdes, also called the year of change, which brought about great hopes for economic development, but, given the adverse climate conditions early in the year, there was no record of decline in key economic development indicators.
The low temperatures in February not only contributed to the loss of millions to the agricultural sector, but limited public economic growth by reducing economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to historical decline by 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by the sea, provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected by 78.03 per cent of them, while the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected by the main affected cultures.
As a result of economic activity, by November, the steady growth of unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, had been fixed at the rate of unemployment, with the rate of unemployment of 55,053 people in Sinaloa being unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the population in the second quarter, with an increase of 5.28 per cent, and by July of the year, it continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, which, in excess of the number of people living in Sinalo, was higher than in the first half.
Eligibility reduction
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa has been discussed over the past year by many factors, for the economist Gerardo Lopes Serventes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Automotives (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained in a consistent way by actions taken in public policy.
"What we now see is the growth of unemployment, which is linked to a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market in order to limit the resources imposed by the law adopted at the Congress to combat money laundering, as well as people who have illegally owned dollars, not just work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Immigrant
Lopes Servantes said there is still a demographic factor in unemployment growth.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of jobs outside the border has been limited in the United States, firstly because of the difficulty in entering, and secondly, as once I entered, they have already faced very many difficulties in finding work, so that the group remains and needs jobs here, in the state, as a result of rising unemployment," he said.
Infringement of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market will become worse if it is to focus on a large number of violations that prevail under the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state's active population is working without being mentioned as workers in a social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and disability, there is another reminder of work in the state of low wages; in the state the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, much lower than the country's average, which is 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of PII
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high rate of unemployment in 2011, the largest direct foreign investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 in January, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 over the same period last year.
On the other hand, the Government ' s Ministry of Economic Development has established a total of 17.28,000 pesos of investments during the year, mainly from services companies.
Value
On the basis of the economic downturn, the Government requested in July at the State Congress a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, to revive the economy at the local level of 2,600 million pesos, and no long-term benefits were expected in any state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Valdes has demonstrated a lack of Government capacity.
Miguel Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Industry, said that during 2011, there was no consensus among the various sectors, including the Government alone.
"The economic efficiency of Sinaloa this year was really low, much work is needed to restore the positions lost this year, and in 2012, we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to agree everyone's efforts and, above all, the good and synchronous work of the new Government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopes Loredo said that such events as early droughts left the state economy this year and its effectiveness and growth were limited.
"The low levels of economy are the result of several events, including the sea, one of the main effects of slowing down, which is not fast enough to create economic dynamics, which enables us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and thus, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Review of addresses
Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Conference of the Workers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its dynamic productive activity.
"As a whole, we have found that we have worked on this, we believe that a long-term programme, which will determine the direction and economic course of the state, needs to be mobilized all the material and human resources that have been at Sinaloa," he said.
Present work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better direct the efforts of the Government.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in its own way in the conduct of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana
Five years of imprisonment and fines in 100 days, such a sentence was handed down to the citizens of Navolat for the custody of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuel Sandval, who was convicted of a health crime, was detained in this case for the purpose of spreading marijuana.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuel Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrol of the streets of Cyprus, before heading No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the role of a white pickup car, where he carried a black bag in the car’s pocket, and on a passenger seat, a small hole where soldiers found eight pounds and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the case was referred to the Second Regional Court and the accused continued to remain in the Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions to work must be made
Public works related to programmes such as the Family, the Rescue of Public Space and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of being incomplete or long-term owing to lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopes Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes had been developed so far, they were in danger, as the Government was not able to make appropriate contributions, which constituted an amount exceeding 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the overall funding of all three programmes consisted of approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be provided by the State, and that only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to conclude.
"They have to put up about 12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn't give us any copies when they were to give us part of it," he said, "that we don't give up, we started the work and they're very busy, but we need money."
He mentioned that in the past year, during the reign of Hesus Aguilara Padillai, the State had not made contributions to be made, so that at the beginning of the term of the municipal administration, money had to be spent to cover more than 7 million, which had not been granted in the case of State administration.
“This happened with us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial capacity to participate, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains to be done,” he explained.
While the State authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he says that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the percentages related to it come as soon as possible.
"They have to bring up almost 12 million, and even though it's over, they didn't give us any copies."
The Court will approve the digital television transition in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals to digital is one of the most important changes that have made the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court (PSC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which would translate the so-called “digital television transition” from 2021 to 2015, since there were no eight votes required for its cancellation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his mandate, issued a decree detailing actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims expressed by the Senate were dismissed because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to speak on the constitutionality or non-institutionality of the decree and remain in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olgo Sanchez Cordero was proposed to declare a decision in non-institutional terms because the regulation of the radio and television programme was the right under the Law of the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Coffetel) to violate the principles of hierarchical co-ordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Horhee Mario Pardo, Margaret Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this point, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates in order to review and support the decree, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to therein regarding the digital change.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies, not only in the discussion of the draft, but also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project in that the federal executive authority could not determine the general rules to which the government should prepare.
“I also do not think that this would have an effect on the autonomy of the governing body”, and I reminded that the planning of public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is related to the federal executive authority with a constitutional mandate, the rule of the State.
The exchange of analogue signals on digital, one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, has led to the better use of radio-electric spectrum, the better quality of signals and more channels.
The restoration of the transition, he said, would mean the restoration of benefits from the digital transformation, which includes the fulfilment of public needs, which is not only technically measured, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These issues, he said, “need the work of the entire system of public economic governance, including a group of authorities that the Constitution combines with the State executive authority.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already moved to digital media, and that it had done so with the assistance of the executive authority, despite the existence of specialized technical agencies.
It cannot be concluded, therefore, that the Government, by adopting the contested decree, which, in any event, affects the competence of the Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, said.
In Michocana, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by vote"
According to the data submitted to the PPE, the difference between the first and second round of Governorial Elections is 27 per cent, even without a vote of 879 of the total of 6.074 Protocols.
The possibility of the vote ' s vote ' s vote ' in this year ' s election process in Michigan, where the difference between the first and the second round of Governorial elections was 27 per cent, even without the total number of 879 votes in 6.074.
In view of this, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Elections of Michocana (IVM), Maria de Los Anheles Lianderal Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michocan had not adopted the Constitution or the Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, as the Congress had approved reforms shortly before the legal date of their entry into force in that electoral process and that the Governor of Leóngel had not included his publication in the time stipulated in the Law in the Official Journal of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On that same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJ) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim issued by the local legislative assembly and called the “inactual and illegal” vote of the State representative on constitutional reform, since it did not have the right to “allow or support”.
In the interview on the possibility of "voting" Maria de los Anheles Ljanderal claimed that with the adoption of appropriate principles, the IVM General Council would be able to submit a partial or full vote by the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more electoral circuits may be carried out under the conditions that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no protocol for voting and the submission of documents in the urine or is not in the chair; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the general count of votes in all elections may be held where there is evidence that the difference between the proposed candidate for the elections is considered and those who received the second place in the vote, less or equal to one percentage, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an application by the representative of the party and/or coalition, which issued the second of those candidates.
The general census will also be made if at the end of the ordinary sub-account it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate taking second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided there is a political party passage that the candidate has taken second place, when the electoral rounds taken into account in the partial recalculation are excluded.
It is noted that in this situation, there are elections in Moreli, where, according to the PPP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, even though it is not considered to be 129 votes in total to 923.
His last wish.
His dust will be discovered in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilots, Felipe Basio Cortesa, arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on the evening of the resurrection; a demonstration was held on Monday.
According to the family, the last wish of the Colonel was to tear his dust to the mountains of Sapalinam.
After the funeral with others who lost their lives in the disaster, the Basio Cortesa family returned to the capital of Coawiil on the plane of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people visited the ceremony in Campo Marte.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Colonel arrived at the clock at Nazario Ortis Garcia’s bulvar, where his family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he passed the exhibition of the Santillo Institute of Technology organized by his former high-school and football team, who was a member of Felipe Basio during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and if his dust was discovered in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortez Basio, a pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the Colonel has fulfilled all his dreams, she thinks that he was on the track of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother given to his family."
Philip Cortez Basio left the very young town of Saltillo to attend the Air Force College in Sapopan, Halisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he had his head tied up even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Horhe Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him as he brought Marto Saagan to Saltillo."
She recalls that even when he was seven years old, he lived in Sapopan at a graduation ceremony for his family, so he knew that his grandfather had died doing what he loved most in his life: controlling the plane.
He's being chased for the last time.
Fires were launched in honour of Lieutenant Colonel Cortez Basio, leader of Governor Horhe Torres Lopes, people from the village and government of the state, the Mexican Army, from the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force, the leaders and students of the technical secondary school in Saltillo, where he had been trained in 1985 and had been successful and trained, and in the sport he was held on the final route.
Basio Cortes recently died when the helicopter he controlled suffered a breach, along with the Government Secretary of the province, José Francisco Black Moroy, and six others, all representatives of the ministry.
At 18:05 the rest of Basio Cortesa, the inhabitants of Saltillo, came to be transferred to the funeral office of members of the Mexican Air Force in the head of Major James Martinez, at a boarding school where his family had already been waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, his mother, his brothers and other relatives, teachers and teacher.
Three bodies were found scattered on the farm of NL Kaderieta
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media ten persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed in various parts of the body, with a controlled explosion on the abandoned farm in the village of Kaderiet Himmenes, Nuevo Leon.
The finding was found at 1.5 kilometres away from Santiago, on the height of the municipality known as El Castillo.
A number of people who had gone by noted that in a wooden house whose walls had been torn down in a refugee and a Korean wall, the doors were opened.
Looking inside, literally three meters, they discovered the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was walking in a hot football game with black jeans, without a knife, and a few more men were found in the white mother.
The body of another man was practically one meter, in a beautiful ruby and deep gins.
All three were lying down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed in another place, as there were no hilarious places.
There are signs of one organized criminal group at the door of the wooden house, as well as a number of bullets in the back.
11 Notes in Kadereet
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 persons, including an adolescent, who were part of a criminal group that was mainly in the municipality of Kaderie, accused of theft, murder, rape and secret custody.
According to the information published, eight people were arrested on 11 November in the Los Alvero colony and one person in the detention camp was saved.
They were provided with three homes and telephones, demanding that they be members of the criminal group called Los Zetas.
The second event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., and the military personnel were on their patrol in the village of Old Rancho, in Kaderiet, when they saw the car without numbering with two men in the hall.
I left them and inspected them, the soldiers found a window, a patrol and 18 patrols.
Later, after those statements, on 13 November, at 14:00 one of them was detained in the public land of La Pradda, which, seeing the soldiers, tried to escape.
He was charged with secret custody in the municipalities of General Terran, China and Kaderieta.
A new Italian Government will be formed in the middle
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce a new government that is facing the crisis that placed the country on the edge of the economic disaster.
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet in the middle with the President of Italy to introduce a new government that is facing the crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and the worst damage to the entire euro area.
A statement from the Presidential Chamber stated that Monti, appointed in the resurrection, would meet with President George Napolitano in order to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will represent a headquarters composed mainly of technocrats, even though it is unlikely that the new executive authority will take its position.
Monty said he would present the outcome of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to choose from this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to the rapporteurs.
Monty did not directly say that he was able to form a government, but his comments indicated that obstacles were overcome.
"The structure is now very focused," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government less than three days, much less ordinary, as Italy has struggled with the political and financial crisis, which has raised its debt at the critical level
The administration under the leadership of the former European Commissioner Monti should approve the package of the hard economy required by European leaders to return to Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monti to speed up, the unstable markets have established income from Italy's BTP obligations for more than 7 per cent over 10 years, at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, head of the Italian Federation of Workers, told the reporters after a meeting with Monty, "We have been told that we will actively support this Government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance Italy has to choose from this critical situation.
Chances of Monty were well-founded in support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, which was forced to leave on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts must lead to a good outcome," said reporter Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the majority of the government, which is composed of the Montenegrin technology.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support for reform, which will probably be non-populated by severe economic reforms.
Any blockage or cessation of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has intensified the pressure by warning that the loss of Monty could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, associations and business groups on Monday, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He ends his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed in the resurrection of Napolitan, which allowed a very rapid transition into response to the crisis.
After a short transition last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would withdraw, Italy's debt had now reached a critical level of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
The saving of Italy with public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial defenders of the euro area.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections appointed for 2013, despite the widespread projections, that policies would only give him time to reform before the new elections would be appointed.
Monty said he wanted to include policies in his office, but the main parties insisted that he should be composed only of technical experts, indicating their discontent with the financial situation in the process.
Political sources reported that mutual distrust and disagreement among parties made it difficult to include political figures.
In Spanish game experience more than in Ticos
Of the 22 games claimed in Spain, ten have already played at least 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players claimed to have played 50 tours.
A small contrast with Costa Rica, compared to the 22 games generated by both countries on the corporate match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While in the world and Europe champions, the number one in the monthly rating FIFA, there is a whole list of Class A election games in Tricolora, there is only Michael Umman as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), on the stadium named Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers playing in the League of All Stars and in the strong British Premier Leagues were very active in the league and in local cubes during this year, and they were high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
This should add to the experience of the Spanish Führer in a complex qualification in Euro or the World Championship.
The Tikos, however, have limited international experience in the CONCAAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish collective golfer Iker Cassilias, who, in the past resurrection against England (the fight left 0-1 in London) repeated the record by the ex-glocist Andona Subhisarret with 126 international matches.
Cassilias is now playing against Triclora and will set up a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
At Havi Ernandes, Barcelona, 106th floor.
Casillas and Hawaii were better recognized last week by WEFA along with the other Iberian team, Subhisarret, with 126 fighters and the Shalk Raul Gonzalez bomber with 102.
Nearly a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres - with 90, David William and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Inesta - with 62, Sesk Fabregas - with 61 and David Silva - with 53.
On the coast of Costa Rica along with Michael Umman, the left side of Hunior Dias with 48 mats and a bomber Brian Ruiss - 45.
In addition, only five people crossed the border in 30 games: Kaylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeefa with 32, Michael Barrantez with 31, Carlos Ernandez with 36 and José Luis Lopes with 35.
Stay.
More than 30 mothers in Spain are in Žera Pike (37), Serhio Buskets (36), Santiago Katsorle (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
In a collection of less than 30 exits, there's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even get up to 20.
Then when Nacho Moreall had only four games, and Hordy Albes - two, in Costa Rica in Victor Bolivara alone, the German Vargas and Nelson Edder had not yet debursed.
The leading game of Spain, David Willia with 50 votes, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Brian Ruiss, who brought more checks, twice more than Carlos Ernandes and three times more than Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country in the tour in respect of a 20-year career
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true
In an exclusive interview, Viva Basin Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts in the next resurrection at the National Stadium.
It was more than 20 years to wait, but the group said that it was also a dream for them to play in this country.
This was the approval of the founder and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave the exclusive interview of Viva from Brazil last week.
The Group is located in the territory of South America in the course of the twenty-first year of work, and the 20th anniversary of its sole stay in Central America.
On that day they will speak at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 a.m., with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local group of Las Robertas.
It's a waste from the office, full encryption that is available online in The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica it's a coming dream that Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are trying to do?
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
It's only our second visit to South and Central America, and it's still going well.
I was in Costa Rica only once - this is a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're so happy to bring our music there.
I ask that, because there are some generosity of the group; the fans live in a hurry on the day before the concert.
What will you say to your most dedicated fans?
Thanks for having been with us all those years.
We spent almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we regret having spent so much time here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, belong to him as a big show for the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we played in the last two weeks of the past 21 years.
We had a few great shows in San Paulo, and we hope that this led us to this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love serfing and jungles, which are one of the best countries in the world, Costa Rica.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her hair for serfing?
We have a lot of serfs friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the wolves are amazing here.
My friends are always doing serfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are excellent places for serfing, as we have learned about it from people who love serfing.
Looking at the tower, you can say that you've done a generous show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning to say in Costa Rica?
As we've never played there before, we don't have any limitations on what we can do.
We're trying to make a better show of the most diverse songs we can; we're trying to play a couple of songs from each album and present to our fans a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How is that possible?
I think it's partly because we have nine plastics and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of why we loved these songs and why we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting for us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting for people.
In this tour, you notice 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think that none of us could ever imagine that we would be in a rock group and that what we've been doing for more than 20 years makes this like a dream.
We are happy for our success, and we are very happy that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we love to create music.
We're happy to build places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Everything is very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a major part of the border color?
It has always been a privilege to be part of this group of great collections.
We're good friends with the kids from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's nice when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time a group of one city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We're proud and we're honored to be part of the Seattle team.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with them all, and for us the honor of being part of Seattle's voice that was received.
It is also very strange that the group of your kind will remain together and at the same time be so long.
Yes, four of us were 21 years old, and Matt (Cameroon) joined us 13 years ago, which is just a lot longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're still alive, and second, we're going to worry about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, we have also opened up the musical ways that give each experiment freedom.
We trust each other's music, and it can't be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy, but you were able to do what you wanted with your success.
How do you find the balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We'll worry about not being too long in the tour, because it's easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you should respect music and what it has done, not deciding to be famous and to be a rock star, which none of us will ever care about.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're really good songs, and that was great at first.
We were a group for almost three years and did not release any albums, which led to the death of Andy (Andre Woods).
It was a lot of disappointment, because it took so long, and most important, that we were still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I heard a song or a photograph, I think about the amazing man who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, always had the pleasure of going to work, laughing, talking about music and football and many others.
He was a remarkable man, and we're running on him.
The local group will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Woodder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yes, the promoters sent us a few videos, and it was a group that liked us most, so we don't have to see that Las Robertas can offer a living, and that should be very impressive.
Why do you always change words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's the question of Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He's taking her, and I think he's using the first thing that comes into his head.
Who affected you like the bass?
They're so many.
Among the first to come to mind, Gizer Butler, John Entvisl, Si Jay Ramon, John Dou, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
I can tell them so much that I can tell them all day about the bastists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the border's relevance despite being no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling some distance from the border.
When I think about it, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, the kind of Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that happened at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great because it's music that should be heard, and the team that kind of Mudhoney is now creating music better than ever.
At first your music was darker, and now it was more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It's interesting, as I think, there are several songs in the album that can be said easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very dark, although they can sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when he heard them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up, and in your life there was some trauma and you lost a family member or another, these events begin to affect your creation and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it to me.
So, I think you can be a happy man and still be able to create a dark music.
Peru:
Fuchimori was re-hosted for medical examination
The ex-President, Alberto Fuhimori, was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital, to investigate the loss of muscle strength that was observed in the legs, told his family doctor.
Fuchimori, 72, who has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, which has been transmitted four times and is under surveillance.
The Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fuhimori would be investigated within three days at the National Institute of Nonplastic Diseases in order to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in its lower ends.
In his view, Fuhimori had to be a candidate for the benefit of humanitarian treatment; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He transferred four operations to the cancer of the tongue, lost 18 kilograms of weight to which other diseases were added, such as severe gastric gastritis, gastric acids, pellets, high blood pressure, and bleeding problems in the legs, and listed the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 persons by the army's destruction squad, which was secret in the first year of his reign.
Music is being sent to Mexico to strengthen political relations
The official delegation, headed by President Uruguay José Mukhiko and a number of ministers and businessmen, will come this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to increase trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Music will meet in the next environment with its Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important part of the extensive plan to meet with the political, commercial and community leaders living in Mexico, as described by Uruguay.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalahar will be “beneficial for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership has published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is supported by the Calderona for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicola Sarkozi included the South American country in the list of taxes for a G20 meeting in the French city of Kanne.
In his speech, Sarkozi threatened to exclude those countries remaining tax-free from the international community, a statement that provoked Uruguay's protest and called for the consultations of his Ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chaired by a group of the strongest developed and developing countries since November in G20 and has, in fact, with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements to abandon this “serious list” of Economic Cooperation and Development Organization from countries that are not benefiting from international standards of tax cooperation.
With regard to the Trade Plan, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (STS), which has increased trade between the two countries.
The water tanker will become three-footed with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario has been fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the bad bug Bouzer, but he has never done that in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of girls in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will appear in world stores this month, was created in the light of the characteristics of Nintendo 3DS Portal, which allows for three measurements without the need for the use of glasses.
"Mario - a hero who has to report how stereoscopy will work without a shot," said the head of Nintendo Press Service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, at the time of the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video especially developed under this platform", because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adapted to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is a "accessible" video that allows fast and moving.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" had two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
At one point, most experts will go "on the second round" to the level of games that are more complex at this time.
In addition, users can actually choose between "D aggressive" or, which affects only the depth of action, but which must be played in three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and not to “opportunity”.
This super Mario entry in three dimensions also refers to the return of the hero to the Portal Consulate, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo defeats the fans of the series and repeats a successful formula from the previous game, the driver and everyone must go through dangerously removed platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the game will find new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as "playing" Luigi.
Colony guarantees the extradition of Portillo in the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the process of extradition of Alfonso Portillo had begun to respond to a United States commitment of $70 million.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which requested that Portillo be issued to judge it there.
At the press conference, Coloma said that his decision was related to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, bearing in mind that the first instance court had already signed extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he “did not apply his hand” to legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
With Portillo Sergio Ruano Marrokin, he will be released for murder and serious physical injuries, as well as Edgar Estrad Morales and Victor Estrad Paredez, both for drug abuse.
What was done by the Colum shows the execution process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-heading of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CP), Portillo will be dealt with once by a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was recognized as innocent at the cost of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-exempt process, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and the case was reopened.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people under social isolation have been helped to overcome the difficult situations over the fourth century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be purchased.
The anniversary was the result of a ceremony held at the site of the old Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared in the world with Trinita Velya in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or forced marginalization.
A large number of responsible organizations and institutions that worked with the association during the past 25 years have been celebrated in Sant Andreu.
The different political representation during the elections showed the unique nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generality, Artura Massa, and his predecessor, Hordy Pukola, attended the ceremony, an ex-consult of Socialist Education, Ernest Margal, and an ex-leginant mayor and current socio-socialist, member of the municipal council of Richard Goma.
The current social welfare and family consultant, José Luis Cleris and SEO, also appeared in Fabra I Coats, La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove had appeared in the light at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far was "a good basis".
The President introduced Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad conditions and the realization of trust in people facing difficulty.
"The crisis is not new to her organization and work," he said.
The building in which mass festivals were held was evacuated
The arresters occupied 11 out of 13 buildings on the Balms street, 51
12 The occupying Power left the building yesterday in the field without fighting
It seems that the nightmare of neighbors living in the house 51 on the way to Balms has come to an end.
Twenty people left the building that they had illegally occupied yesterday and where they had organized mass dinners that had been distributed to their neighbors by the court without interference from the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there's going to be a pass control here," said the manager.
Squatters, which had captured 11 out of 13 buildings, the rest of the population, took all electricity and part of the water, broke down the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially the alcohol-based banks.
The first three stages were a table for mass dinners, which lasted two days and scattered the owners.
There is a night club, Balms 51, which has also been damaged.
The governor, Maria Pantinat, reported that since the building was occupied, her income has decreased by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club says that the owners of the building have lured her into unfair fraud, as they sold three euros drinks, and ten clubs.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to complaints by neighbors on the noise, although, as she noted, the noise was not caused by the club's visitors, but by the squats and, above all, by those who visited the evenings that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of those who had grown up, as the neighbors had said.
The owner of the club said that the disadvantages were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and here it was nine months ago that he "sold" her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that more complaints had been received in recent weeks from neighbors in the situation.
The President of the PP municipal group, consultant Alberto Fernand Dias, called for the last week to “study the building immediately to address the problems of the existence and the general spirit of the neighbour and the degradation of the area”.
The popular leader explained that until the summer only one building had been built, but in the past few months, cassettes entered all the floors and virtually every room, and some of them had been damaged.
In that sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the culture of the building.”
So, yesterday, police members evacuated the building in New Barris.
At 15:30 the police went out on Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed how four people entered the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of competition after the suspension of contributions
The municipal competition at the 16th door renewed the debate on the role of the Coliseum in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, the Barcelon Stock Corporation (SCB) was now under attack, and this administration printed a promo-list for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the New York Central Park.
With SKB's death in 1987, the park again took place in the knowledge of many as a high point in Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that were not in the north, and above (the sea).
The position of the Coliseum as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype wasn't the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a beautiful cabin in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the case until, in September, the Council announced a huge competition of 16 competitions for many other rounds in Coliseum.
The idea of a park, of course, is understood under the scrolls.
Either way, or someone wants to put the wind on the field.
The question is one: Colserola, park or mountain?
The mergers, their organizational side and their impact on the city are the subject of discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring subject discussed when two members of this class of chosen people meet each other in the elevator.
This fact is one of the few similarities between the speech of the three architects of Barcelona and the scholars present.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: meeting appropriately
For Rolanda, after reaching the coastal line, it would be necessary to discuss "the first side of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefon Serdi, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"It must be admitted that the biggest Barcelona park is the beach.
Besides, thanks to his excellent availability.
The Coliseum is more complex," says the architect for whom the title "Colserole Gate" contains a "wordal leap": we should not think of them "as entering the park, but as limiting certain areas where we should act".
Modola, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "indefinition of public space forecasting" after the 80th experience, which ended at the Forum's "Lebanon Song".
The first fear is the own limit of the border, where you can build.
"Restriction of something is the next step," there is a shift.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools, as current [on the General Capital Plan (CSC)] can lead to real disaster.”
Close to the case, Modolo believes that a simplification of the Coliseum may be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than as a purely topographic issue.
The module recalls that there is already a work done outside Calserol, which “should not be missed by the ears”, although it is grateful for the opportunity that Mary has offered to enter the project “from the very beginning”.
Furthermore, he understood that the approach of the mountains to the city was a passage that allowed architects to enter the debate, but “he doubted” whether this technical profile was what should be guided by interdisciplinary teams (“performance”), which should have been created: “Archiectors should only be an instrument”.
The Bayona suggests that the answer to the question posed by the name of this part is complicated, as in the rules of competition it does not understand the general nature of the Coliseum: "There have been 16 cross-border competitions," he says, in the sense of the sea, but there is no food reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This would, at least in his case, lead to 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one roll can be cut off by programme and the project of the architect for the next roll.
From your point of view, the Council should ensure that the area directly above Ronda de Dalt is to be provided in its full area equipped for the establishment of a river crossing between the city and the green.
The casino is forgiven by Jonas Larsabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the representative of the justice, Red Casino, apologized to the Brother of Mary Monterey in the trial against him on charges.
After 72 days in prison, Manuele Jonas Larsabal will be released after the legal representative of Red Casino apologized to him before the Second Criminal Court, which is conducting the proceedings against the brother of Mary Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Serhio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jones asked him to pay for a financial contribution so that the Monterey authorities could secure a secret operation in the game house.
Following a public trial, the State Attorney-General opened a criminal case against his brother, Mary, and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Four hours later, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old capital of the State.
There he remained 49 days following the second order on the prohibition of displacement after the prosecutor had removed the crime on the recruitment and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kaderiet for the purpose of obtaining a half-million pesos to the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with the average isolation of prisoners, as he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to remain in a municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garze.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Horhe Janes, who said that, after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence of Jonah's guilt, such as the acquisition of 1.5 million pesos with the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for the authorisation of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, presented to Judge José Luis Pesin to make a request for an apology for his brother, Mary of the region, so that he could be released in the following hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the trial, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomes, whether he had been injured and who of the players in the game house had made a mistake, even though the lawyer had tried not to make a name.
On the basis of the record of 197/2011, the legal remedy granted to Jonah Larrasabal was granted, and no complaints could be made about the process planned against him; nor would any compensation for damage or punishment be required.
Following the hearing of the legitimate representative of the bookmaker, almost 15:50, an immediate release of Larrasabal Breton was ordered.
The servant court, Horhe Janes, was sent to San Nicolas, a municipality in Garze, to tell Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate order for release signed by the judge.
Minister Dionicio Peres Hacome tells of the disaster where the Minister of Internal Affairs, Francisco Black, and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of the accident, during which the Interior Minister of Francisco Blake Mora and seven others had been killed, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in full perfection without an attempt by the pilot to cause an accident.
During the press conference, Dioniso Peres Hacome, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that prior to the airship's rise, the pilot had found that suitable conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the ship had several contact with land have been contacted with trees at 25 metres, where the vehicle has lost its fluid."
It also reported that the ship was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that studies in the area of the attack did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
" The study reveals that in another location no components of the ship have been affected by a structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant passenger transport requirements.
The earth in this place has a depth of from seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, primarily, to obtain results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopes Mayer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that the presidential helicopter was operating at the creezer speed and that it had happened on the soft ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the normal summer maneuver at the time of the attack," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of SCT, Peres Hacome, listed six important elements in the survey:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the train was carried out according to the visual flight rules, which meant that the teams should have visibility during flight and landing.
Suitable conditions:
The AICM reports identified the appropriate conditions for flight when the aircraft was transferred to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where the layers of clouds were observed on low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that, due to the conditions of the command, the area was searched for less altitude and greater visibility in the province of Kuernavac.
A place to hit.
The coordinates of the strike and the last recorded with the aircraft's radar are likely to have not lost control or change the flight direction before the attack.
Deployment of clouds in small areas:
The information available so far indicates that the attack has taken place on the front and side lines.
The irradiation of the clouds makes it clear that the helicopter has come from the ground under structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been found:
In the disaster zone, undisputed evidence remains in the cargo compartments, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there may have been numerous contacts with the land.
During the work of the site, an airship was found at 9,200 feet above sea level, with a depth of from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photos show consistency in which it was broken down on the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have several tunnels from the ground.
After a thorough investigation into more territory than the area surrounding the disaster site, no fragmented parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that an attack occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces the programme for the search for genome
Social protection leads to a study on the search for a gene for children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that a study is being conducted with a view to detecting the gene of pregnancy in children and young people, which has been called the “Genetics of pregnancy in children and adolescents” protocol, which will provide the basis for the signs associated with obsessive pregnancy.
In his statement, the Head of the Biochemistry Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez explained that a multiprofessional team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been gathered.
The team is assisted by the National Institute for National Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Police Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (proscribed or not) is invited to participate in the MSSI sports centres participating in the study in Mexico, where the children will be tested every Saturday at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be reported at the sports centre in Kuwait (in the western part of Mexico) and, on 8 October, the event was held at the sports centre in Nessaualkototle, eastern Mexico.
After the target of 500 to 600 children is achieved, the study continues at the Sports Centre of Independence (South Mexico) and, finally, at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the composition and importance of genetics with regard to the development of pregnancy and to establish a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic deorientative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Day for Diabetes will be marked, and the main goal will be to collect three thousand children and adolescents from 6 to 14 years of age from parental leave and under their example to fill individual meals.
They will also be asked about physical activity and about the history of family inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to disease such as diabetes or early disability.
He explained that on Saturday an anthropometric measurement would be carried out by all participants (severe, growth and size), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to detect genes related to child aging).
Cross Lopez said that this study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies from 1999 to 2006 indicate that there has been an increase of 77 per cent for boys, 47 per cent for girls and 47 per cent for girls, and that there has also been significant growth here," said MSSI.
He said that the reason for the search for markers was that the people of the country were different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He suggested that the average Mexican population was 65 per cent of American Indians, 30 per cent of Europeans and five per cent of Africans, and that this condition affected the gender related to diabetes and obesity.
He explained that, mainly because of the genetics of aging, it is a failure of the organism to generate the energy that we consume (calorie) and it is resuscitated in the form of electricity.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit of participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can determine whether they have any level of weight or weight.
In fact, he said that the presence of dark stocks on the tea (cattles) and the benefits meant the likelihood of metabolism and even prediabetes.
Information is provided with all confidentiality, and the doctor transmits it in writing to parents, who explain all the measurements and changes in the way of life that must be taken to avoid illness.
Crus Lopez explained that there are three main reasons for causing excessive weight, vomiting and other chronic diseases: a living form, or lack of daily physical activity, much of the day before the TV and the use of transport in small areas instead of walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, which is also the increase in the consumption of sweet drinks and hydrocarbons (tama, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with the high content of animals and proteins and genetics analysed in this programme.
Asphalt UNAM will escape the third
Rafael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical college, developed a polymer modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, sustainable to the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by the road cover were to be taken into account, about 200 thousand meals would be repaired every year in the capital area of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rafael Errera Naher, a researcher at the UNAM chemical college, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalted road cover process is correct, their number could be reduced or all reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the technological view of the germs read in the International Year of Chemical reports that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of mixtures with the characteristics of near-bit but better resistance to both high and low temperatures.
Errera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of the road and consequently to counter the education.
He explained that the most difficult part of the oil is the consistency of the carbon molecule, one of the high molecular mass called asphaltes, and the other of the low molecular mass of the so-called small ones, which, together, contribute to its characteristic binding behavior.
The parallel behavior of the Batuma is based on the fact that at high temperatures around 180 degrees it conducts itself as liquidity at 120 degrees, and at 50 degrees at Celsius it maintains almost a solid condition, while at very low bitrates it becomes weak, he said.
This means that the resistance to street asphalt is not constant but changes throughout the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
The scientists observed that the streets of Mexico are mainly covered by a flexible covering made up of six layers of material, three of which are the last ones to be included in the battle.
Among the top layers is a bit consisting of small stones covered in a bit and then pressed.
Every stone that forms this cover, he said, was loaded into battle.
The movement of vehicles and the exercise of effort will help the forces to be well distributed on the road.
If it were a modified asphalt, they'd be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt surface, he added the last layer, called the export layer, made from a small stone, actually also the sand of the asphalt.
As it is a layer that will be linked to transport vehicles, it must have more resistance than asphalt coverage and road training.
As part of the road coverage that will be obtained and disseminated, the flow of exports also requires a proper density and the material from which it is produced must be taken into account.
The weather, particularly the humidity and temperature change, are also very important factors for the consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on asphalt status.
When the soil is dry, water flows into the surface, and it is difficult to get out of there, it causes all the layers of cover to cool down and therefore to grow.
In the education of food, he said that the first issue was the issue of export, and only then it had an impact on the battle, but the injury was not a minor, which should be taken into account in the first signs of the current repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that the transport load is another important factor in the education of the race, so the length of each layer should always be linked to the transport load and it should be ensured that this requirement is met in order to prevent its partial appearance.
Raphael Errera said that with respect to the battle, much still needs to be studied and done, for example, by atomic emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help make them easy and without high temperatures.
Why didn't you get a candidate from Vale to become a new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons why Sir Meline Ramires mixed up to receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valé received the title of the princess 14 times.
On the other hand, Vale del Cauca has only wanted to capture Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramires Serena had to be satisfied that she had fallen on the floor of the winners with a silver crown and a coat that announced to her new princess, Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the bishop, the department consists of 14 titled Princes, and Melina joins the legion of Vale-del-Kauka, who were close to the crown, but were announced by the princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominy (1949), Patricia Bellina Aila (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rose Marie Alsate (1983), Léla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Evers (1989), Maria Evers (Mary) and Maria Gérnez (now Carenedo), Jeana (1990), Jeana (J).
The question that many now ask is:
Because the result is the expression of the main fevority that has been shown in each of the statements that it has everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not just so she was chosen by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person on the Vogue version of the title that the Queen had, for example, Tatian Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who had received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to condemn the title of the First Princess was that she could not confidently answer the question, "What book characterizes you, and why?, by Martin Muriel Gomez of the literature society, we respect David.
She answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that a book that characterizes my child is a little prince."
Today I am reading "Religion and Punishment" is the theme of the world literature that we should read; I am also reading the book Irina Nemiro, the Russian writer, a wonderful book called the Iron Blood."
The answer that did not interest Jews because of the term “culture” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the books quoted characterizes it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "All wisdom is going to happen."
And all of you, please, read a little little little little little little little little little little prince is a big book.
Among the supposed hypotheses, Vale burned out of popularity.
A report from Bogota suggested that, as her preferred, she had met with objections, and she was a candidate who had received all the preliminary awards (culinary osterization, a fair vote for the best national costume, and the Queen Mat), "which aroused the greed of other candidates, caused the king's stress, and as a result she did not stumble at the stage."
This was noted during her first appearance in the bathroom on the Hillton beach and during her two exhibitions on the night-care center.
Although it seemed confident, it was not aware that it did not have the strength and energy shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantis.
Ariel Osario, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milan was named prince meant that a candidate who won more prize during the contest would not become a king.
In addition, the representative of Valé has recently fled from the press and has been wrong.
The second hypothesis is that the representative of Vale has failed to convince jury interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Contest of Krasoth.
That is why two days before the election of an international jury member, Lucy Dotty, said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Ms. Colombia, we must look not only at the outside but also focus on public knowledge before they participate in the competition, they must be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative of Valé has been mistaken for the defects of the eggs and the fibrosis that have been seen in her life, but it is controversial, as the jury particularly noted her as a "natural beauty" candidate, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The adviser to King Horhe Ernan Orosko notes that Melina had no better body than they had, "but the problems of fibrosis in my life which were not very obvious to me have caused her to lose her eyes in the last day."
In addition, journalist Guido Oios from Cromos' magazine believes that the error of the representative of Valé de Kauka was that she was subjected to surgical intervention.
"The operations are good, but the representative of Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize that was awarded to the organizers of the National Competition for Beauty for the first time, a bad prediction came last night, saying that it was the child that Raymondo gave Melina a compensation for her lack of the satisfaction of receiving the crown.
That is not the fact that Melina is now beginning the year of rule, not as a king, but as a prince, the position that enables her to present Colombia at one of the international summits indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will come into history as one of the kings who, despite her earlier speech at the Cartagena competition, had encountered difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was a man's job that knew the body of Alfonso Cano.
A criminal from Kali went into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is key.
On 4 November CTI Criminal, he went into history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Cano in comparison with his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working in the CTI, this week, Elizar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tehad, who had spent 21 years in the judiciary.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Chicago, where he often had to spend more than five days through the jungle in order to get places where the bodies needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valé, and after completing the relevant courses, he became a criminal specialist in the field of skin training, i.e. ladones and dogs.
On the week of Elizar ' s human identification operation, known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear no more than three days' clothes.
Something big is approaching.
On Friday night, he arrived at the Kauka helicopter in Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two troops, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the oldest party war in the world, so they asked him to take ten photographs of the impressions of Gilermo Leona Saensa (this name).
However, when he arrived with the study group at the place where the body was located, he did not know him outside; he was very different from the one that showed in the media.
He was without fighting, walking like a local farmer, without shoes and a lot of noise.
But prints don't work.
Using a large glass, a black box, a box, and a phonograph, Eliezer compared the prints of the group’s fingers with those of the pictures.
His eyes didn't move: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad asked the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson to confirm that he was the leader of the RVSC.
Can not open message
The recognition received by President Juan Manuel Santos Elissa Gonzalez at the press conference on surgery against Cano was particularly significant for a specialist in the field of dactyloscopy of Sijin from Kali.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopy is a hard science, without mistake, it can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the body, dectyloscopes participate in investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and establish the identity of persons detained.
In detention, many criminals have separate credentials or do not have documents.
We'll take their prints and find them in the base.
The researcher said that in the event of a theft, he had to carry a piece of the wall of the house because the gate was working with his hands to hold the safe, precious, and money.
"It was hard to work with walls because they were not easy surfaces to remove prints, but in this case we can make photographs of the whole chain and establish the identity of the criminal who participated in several thefts," he said.
Printing also helps to exclude or establish the participation of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with boots from under the elevator around him.
As a result, it was found that a relative could be suspected of committing a crime and that, in fact, the fingerprints on the buttons were matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was in the place of murder.
A CTI Dactilescopic specialist explained that a chemical or physical reactor is present in a place where there are prints.
When they appear, they use a ball or a tape to remove them.
After that, the photographs are sent to Asif, which is the database of the offenders, or are entered in the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as indicated in the CSI television programme.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not all that you draw, leaves the impression on you.
However, if this is possible, comparison is made.
The "disgusting people" are calling the New York authorities.
Hundreds of protestors broke the camp in front of the Zucketti Square.
Some of the protestors listened to the court's decision to disband the demonstration from the area and were sent to a neighborhood park.
The members of the Wall Street Movement broke the call to the New York authorities on Tuesday, when they tried to find out again, under the order, at Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the light when they were trying to capture another park of the Great Yablok.
Hundreds of protestors jumped into the Zucotti Square, where they wanted to escape through a court order that allowed the camp to be destroyed by the "distorted people" until the other part of the movement responded to the raid, captured the park in the northern city, where further arrests were carried out.
"Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break the camp on the ground, we will destroy the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Succoth and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the "Pick up Wall Street" movement Mark Bree.
Brej explained that the "disgusting people" response to the evacuation of the palace city, which was ordered by a personal mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg, came to a court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced eviction from the camps and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the “discovered people” began to capture a new park located on the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
At least for a while they could take this place, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the protestors, even though Bree could not call the exact number, Efe said that he saw several journalists who were also in the hands of the dealers.
The organization is convinced that several hundred people stood with the Palaces in a place where religious leaders were sent to demonstrate their support for the members of the movement, trying to act as mediator in the negotiations with the police.
In the meantime, the area of Zukotti, which is private administration, remains closed in waiting for the hearing appointed on this Tuesday, which will consider the legality of today's protesting tomorrow.
Some of the protestors sent there carried and distributed copies of the judgment at the same time and even gave these copies to police guards, which led to "some small meetings", said Bree, who said that some of the police were demonstrators.
The judicial decree prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wal Street movement and urges them to comply with “laws issued after the beginning of the arrest, or prohibit demonstrators from obtaining access to the park with shops and other property used earlier”.
Mr. Bloomberg told the reporters that because of this decision, the city court had stopped opening public space and demonstrators had been informed about it, but local laws did not allow them to reopen palace stores and bedrooms.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of the protestors from the area of Zucotti, which was conducted in the light, during which some 200 arrests were committed, and the decision was taken because the protestors “were in violation of the law”.
Bloomberg said he gave the order to clean the area because it became “a place where people came from not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others”, such as “some businesses were threatened” and neighbors were afraid of “the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation carried out this morning was disgusting and showed that Bloomberg's soul was more deeply interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers, the representative of the movement, who condemned the mayor for “unregarding freedom of speech”.
They also indicated that they were planning to organize "grain action" on Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions, in order to remember the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become the daughter of Mary in a special creative TV show.
Together with Michael Bubelle and other outgoing Canadians, she will appear in the television program "Rassela Peters" on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was assistant to Tim Allen in the Great Remonte, the rescuer in the "Saviours of Malibu", Banni in the "Playboe" of the wife's rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special creative show on Canadian television.
The CTV private television announced today that Anderson, along with the kroner (executive ballad) Michael Bubelle and other outgoing Canadians, will appear on the “Rassela Peters” television program on 1 December, in the role of a perfectly special Maria.
CTV presented today a television show, in which Anderson, also known for its wide-ranging home pornography video on the Internet, where she portrays herself with her husband, Mötley Crée, the drummer group, Tommy Lee, appears like Deva Maria, who is in a small corner representing Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well - known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently spoke as a leader in the tour of the "My Cruel Trophy of Truth" by Charlie Shine, appears in Joseph's role.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV participates in a special fertility show, the Canadian singer Bubelle, who was married in Buenos Aires at the Argentine model Luisian Lopilato at the end of March and who knows so much about the scandals.
Bubble recently called American Kim Cardassian during one of his concerts in New York
Japan born after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5 per cent by domestic consumption and ended the fall rate, which began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still being driven from a devastating earthquake that has led to a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster carried by the Eastern World War II.
According to the Government of Tokyo's first assessment, material losses amounted to $300,000 million, which, despite the heavy world situation, seems to go on.
Following three loss quarters, data on the gross domestic product from July to September have been definitely helped to convert the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter and by 6 per cent per year.
The second quarter, for the Japanese financial year, begins in March 2012 and improves the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The production may be partly due to the restoration of the machinery for the recovery of landfill areas and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of the capital costs observed since January by March, the first reduction after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real transition to the Japanese economy is not based solely on the keinsian impulse, which calls for a crisis to strengthen or restructure infrastructure, using mistakes to grow from zero.
Japan has woke up mainly through the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japan's GDP.
This rate increased by 1 per cent by increasing the cost of cars, travel and rest.
Clemoids
Tokyo provided the internal market when it became a Japanese currency - one of the "valvat-fleet" elected investors who wanted to escape from the debt crisis in the euro area and negative forecasts about the United States, a privilege that would give as a stone to the account of exporters.
The higher cost of debt production is outside the country's borders, which is a serious blow to the country that the economic course is determined by the health of major technological companies.
Toiota or Sonni, for example, blame the yen on their low rates of July by September.
As long as markets continue to remain in the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Esikhiko Noda does not reduce poverty.
We must be aware of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the serious increase in the value of Yemen, said the Minister for Economic Policy Motohis Furukava yesterday.
In fact, prospects are not satisfying.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most States parties had demonstrated clear signs of economic activity in September.
The indicator predicting changes in the world economy showed that major forces are slowing down.
It then reached four decades to 100.4 paragraphs, compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even fallen below the average value of 100 post post post post, since it has broken into eight decades to 99.13 paragraphs.
The Affins resuscitate the soil for doubt
The appellant said that the correction would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligations
With the peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the labyrinth, which leads to a major European debt crisis.
It is felt that the “agreement” of the new Ellade Transitional Government is in line with Brussels’s earlier requirements, without the genuine conviction of political forces, that the facts are confirmed.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos had warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the daily period agreed upon by his appointment could be insufficient for their use, the leader of the Conservative Party of the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that no new measures would be supported by the strict economy in any case and repeated its demand for new elections, which were scheduled on 19 February.
The Government ' s main task is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, which had been made yesterday, opening parliamentary debates, which would be hosted by a new executive authority tomorrow.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reform of the Disciplinary Code of Public Servants and new measures to combat tax cuts will be the first update.
However, the message of Samaras does not explain his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we are not promising anything.”
The leader of the conservators has taken a step further in its EU and IMF guidelines, organizations that need 8,000 million urgently needed Afina, and has explained that he will not be allowed to approve any letter of agreement.
However, the European Commission, while still trying to disband the effect of the approvals of the Papandreum referendum on the style of everything or anything, repeated yesterday that its requirements were unique: it would not recover aid if the new Government and the leaders of the major Greek parties did not sign “a written agreement without any doubt and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economy of Amadeu Altafai said that three inspectors could return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new Government what should be done for the payment of the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been specified.
In the Greek club, he's got nitkes for some time.
Ms. Sofia: "These tools for progress and hope"
The king stressed the "mainly" place of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain “has taken a visible place in the world in microfinance”.
King Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor in terms of cooperation instruments, which she said, "the fact," is that it is the " instrument of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in people".
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valyade yesterday with the belief that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and “especially with a view to reducing the number of people living less than one dollar a day, at which the poverty rate has been defined.
Spain " Still works" to expand the world's network of beneficiaries and take up this task with all "responsibility", says Dofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit that will continue until Thursday will be "to ensure the creation of new capacities and best opportunities for the poorest people, especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these sentences".
There's "a lot of achievements" and "a lot of difficulties we're dealing with."
The microcredit summit is not only a platform for disputes but also a platform that contributes to "two main objectives".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and a hundred million of these households would be excluded from the poverty in which they were engaged.
The call for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world, "go on the way, starting years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Ms. Sofia as "the act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a “prepared idealist in the universal fight against poverty”, whose work was known for 15 years, since the king was sent to Bangladesh to study his credit policy.
This experience was the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development all over the world," said Her Majesty, which had brought to her the title "family heads", which was held in Valyadolid, the Bank of the Poor."
Finally, the King of Sofia concluded a statement calling on the participants to participate in the discussion and to take decisions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Empire"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and Herzegovina said solidarity was a “ethical imperative” for each democratic State.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with economic time, as is the “permanent obligation”.
The Himmenes concluded that microcredit was a “serious and firm course aimed at eradicating poverty” and that now “more than ever” the Governments of developed countries should work in line with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soria Rodríguez, appreciated the “performance” in order to give people "confident" the "participation" of all the doors closed," and Mr. Valjadolda Francisco Havier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those in the city who “opens its doors, covered by a spirit of solidarity”.
HDS proposes to elect the President of the Eurocommission by a general vote
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (HDS) held in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, without major problems for Angel Merkel, who is also the president of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe has not been specifically planned in the programme, but it has only become clear, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that the Government's policy is not as strict as it should be today in relation to Greece and perhaps tomorrow as regards Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, which was discussed by the governing body, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from the vote.
The arrests continued for a few minutes, which were deserved by Angel Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schyobelle, the Europhil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is in lozunge: the genuine response to the crisis is "not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, it's time to break up in Europe.
This could mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty which would enhance the control of the European Union over the financial policy of the Eurozone countries, but it could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a universal vote to bring a European person.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which is apparently the subject of Wolfgang Schyeble.
Of course, it is little wonder that twenty-seven countries are quick to agree with this decision; Britain is against it, and HDS leaders believe that Nicola Sarkozi is also against it.
But the soil is ready.
In the same way, the overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to raise the voice of each member of the Euro Union in the European Central Bank's government, in accordance with the size of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wanting to ease the situation in his party, the Chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenaure and Helmut Kolya, but she has not tried to influence the Congress by means of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that would like to criticise "higher" Germany.
Although the whole paragraph of the draft resolution on Europe refers to the importance of the German-French friendship, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
It's just a mytho.
I remember that two centuries ago Leipzig became a stage of a blood battle.
In fact, it was one of the most devastating attacks of the Napoleonian army.
What's the problem with the medical records?
After financial benefits, UMPs and the Government began to come to hospitals.
On 15 November, Nicola Sarcosi would come to Bordo to visit the Family Benefit Distribution Fund and to address the issue that has been periodically raised since 2007 on combating fraud in the field of social benefits.
And in order to help this event, which has come out of a difficult situation, but which is also part of the presidential re-election campaign, the majority would like to focus on hospital papers.
Firstly, in terms of the budget economy, the Government intends to impose on private companies on the fourth day of unpaid leave prior to the start of payment of benefits.
It is evident that, without the employer's consent, the sick worker loses a salary for four days, at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
The measure that threatens the birth of a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, leads to the economy of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, i.e. to impose on public servants one day free of sickness benefits (State servants have not yet had to wait for benefits other than waiting for the three-day period in the private sector).
Now, when these issues are discussed, most of them also raise the subject of fraud, with a view to abuse in the delivery of medical documents.
The control will be more sensitive and additional, if you are caught, you will have to return all your illegal payments," Ksavye Bertran on the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been a number of unreasonably real abuses with medical records.
They have indeed been under constant control since 2002.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the numbers on the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Studies and Documentation, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to €11.3 million, representing 5 per cent of the total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were related to direct release and accidents in production and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, amounting to $6.2 million.
As a result, 2.5% of health-related costs were incurred.
France conducted a hospital on average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to Alma Consulting Group.
A survey published in 2007 by a career manager Monster.com showed that 75 per cent of the 40 000 injured French workers said they had not taken one day of the hospital.
Another study on health insurance this time claimed that 37 per cent of patients were below 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent of 15 days a month, 15 per cent of one to three months, and 11 per cent were longer.
Compared with the figures of European neighbours, it is evident that French workers are not more inclined to take care of the hospital than those of any other country.
A long-term study conducted by two CNRS researchers in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall proportion of unemployment in France (health or net) was between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of confusion related to hospital letters is very low compared to the "serious" employment.
As for the level of muscle, it's very low.
The enforcement of the law after 2002 resulted in a systematic examination of patients for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases examined by CNAM, 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term disease findings were "unjusted" or too long", which constitute 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital letters over 45 days, 11 per cent of 1.2 million cases were "unresponsible or unreasonable", equivalent to 132 000.
It is generally found that 169 000 cases have been "unreasonable" to a number of millions of workers who received hospital letters.
The figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with the numbers of "serious" employment.
According to UMP Dominica Tiana, author of the report on this issue in June, they constitute from 9 to 15 million euros of unencumbered budget income per year, which exceeds the total daily compensation costs, and thus, in the long run, more than the loss of interest.
Admissibility: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, in Parliament, Prime Minister Lucas Papalimos added that the 100 days of his coalition Government had not been enough to meet this task.
"To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme," said the head of the Government, who made his first public statement, opening up a debate on trust in parliament in the environment.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October must be a "primary task" of the new Government, as the country ' s presence in Eurozone " is markedly " .
Accordingly, the State budget deficit is projected to decrease by about 9 per cent from GDP to the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rights reject the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the rights, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to remove the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support the additional measures of the strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with Members from his New Democracy Party.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating spending, but also his rejection of any course that prevents the recovery of the economy.
Olli Reno, the European Commissioner responsible for Economic and Financial Affairs, who warned that IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under outside pressure.
It is necessary to legislate etanus and suicide with side-by-side assistance, and the Committee of Experts states
The Canadians refuse to die, as confirmed in the report of the Canadian Royal Society
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative assistance, without considering cancer.
The Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Canadian Society, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, were involved.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code so as to permit suicide with foreign aid and etanus, when the election is subject to circumstances, and the patient may be considered competent to take such a decision.
For the first time, experts referred to a recent study of the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is located in 10 places, the study notes that “the medicization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to dispute the subject of death”.
Because of medicization or not, but 77 per cent of Canadians have no access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Canadian society report.
And 68.6 percent of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest country rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that they disagree with the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not want anything to change in the criminal code in respect of euthanasia and suicide with side-by-side assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or delimited, there is no evidence that such demining would lead to abuse, that is, the execution of etanus or suicide with side-by-side assistance for people who cannot or do not wish to take such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during a teleconference by Joselin Dauni, who reported that most of these cases were in countries where ethanasia and suicide were not legalized with foreign aid.
Estonia is practiced in Canada where it is apparently illegal.
A self-sustainment with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Joselin Dauni.
United States of America
It should be recalled that 85 per cent of Canadians speak for etanus because, according to Angus Reida's 2010 survey, they believe that this will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
66 per cent believe that the legislation of Estonia will not be a sign that the lives of elderly people or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to persons who have been helped by suicide, 41 per cent of the suspects believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the report's authors have expressed less uniformity.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that the legal cessation of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to learn in a spirit of respect to refusal of medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best of palliative assistance, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal session already widely applied in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve in the event of physical pain such as euthanasia and subject to the same restrictions.
Notes by other experts
Some health-related law experts have already made comments on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Canadian Society.
Metro Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described as "restriction" the position of experts who signed the report, since it does not limit the use of Ethanian death cases.
This opens the door to situations where everyone who has lived and who has lived for more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide, says meter Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metre Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to be independent of all other values that constitute the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Specialist for Health Law Margaret Somerville also expressed "a categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she referred to as "manifest for Estonia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is discriminating, inter alia, reports on abuses in some countries where eviction and suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Asada to exercise his power
Damascus condemns "the deal."
Syria is becoming more isolated
The Barara Asada parties had demonstrated yesterday before the construction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Last night, the diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified, with the support of Russia, which was opposed and condemned as “a treaty” against its country.
Two days after the withdrawal of the membership of Syria in the League of Arab States, the European Union imposed sanctions on Damascus, and the neighbours of Syria Turkey and Jordan said that the President of Assad had withdrew.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to summon President Basar Assad to power in Syria, where he was still killed around the age of civilians and servants of the armed forces.
"If Barara had the interests of his country, he would have to withdraw, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, said the king of Jordan, next to Syria, in the BBC.
In turn, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmed Davutoglu, expressed regret that Turkey's media efforts, which began early this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations lose their power, he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country in which Turkey is taking a more severe course.
On the other hand, the United States welcomes the “increasing consensus against Asada and the Syrian regime” which follows the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, and such countries as Turkey, have taken a more rigorous course in relation to repression in Syria, Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
At the same time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the armed forces have been killed in the Dera region of southern Syria, reports the Syrian human rights observer post (OSDH).
Two other residents died during the shooting and were shot by heavy bombers in Jobara in the city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
In addition, he strongly reacted to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which, he said, was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, knowing that the promise against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria from the League of Arab States, he is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and calls for the exploitation in the country of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Allen Juppe, also called for UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, he said, had fallen into the "parano" regime.
The new emergency meeting was scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November and providing, in particular, for the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities where the fighting took place and for the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov referred to the "inaccurate" solution of the League of Arab States yesterday, while China called on Syria to implement a crisis exit plan, but refused to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty needs time in the Italian markets and victims.
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form its command and to implement the programme that would require the victim to restore the credit capacity lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi regime.
The former European Commissioner had previously participated in discussions with political parties before the present meeting with trade unions and employers.
It has to form a relatively moderate cabinet consisting of technocrats that are not part of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of the programme of many victims, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after a meeting with the candidate for the Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Mr Fini, said he would wait to know whether Mario Monti would ask Parliament to vote for Friday in order to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list of duties or about the heads of the country of Georgia Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of the fund exchanges and obligors, at their request time.
When “democratic time is needed for the preparation of government and programme, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that the markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but the concern arose again, especially after the sudden fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a command that included the most important, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also want to include "politics".
The new Government will have to act before 2013, he said.
According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies of Janfranco Fini, the new Government will receive the trust of Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that, upon entering the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Ren stressed that, despite the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.
The European Union, which was convinced that Rome would not implement the budget for 2013, in spite of the plan for the fast economy adopted in recent months, needed, in particular, new strict measures.
Italian boss Emma Marchegalja, who met with him on Tuesday, also stressed the need for economic reunification, "because a country that has no growth will not be able to meet the criteria of deficit."
Mr. Monty, familiar with his competence and independence in the home of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the "change of epohi" for Italy after 17 years of "Berluscony", "professor", a symbol of "serious challenges" and "other Italy", according to the authors of the predecessors.
The length of his command is unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid short-term elections, as Italy should pay for public debt commitments of 200 million euros by April 2012.
Russian scientist supported the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Veceslav Danilenko has helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed by an American agency specializing in the nuclear threat field on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other United Nations documents to establish the identity of this scientist.
For the past week, IAEA expressed concern about the “probably military aspect” of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko had been born in 1934 for 30 years, "the beginning of six hundred years, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and had been involved in the production of synthetic explosives".
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a company that produces "nanoalmaz" in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, IAEA referred to “the clear evidence that the development of Iran” of the nuclear detonators system “has contributed to the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technology but also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on that technology within the military nuclear programme of his country”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent.
According to the FBR statistics published for the period 2009-2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of violence on the racial and religious grounds were reduced or not changed during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, with an increase of 49 per cent compared to an increase of 13 per cent of Catholic violence, a decrease of 4 per cent of attacks on Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent on religious grounds.
The total number of crimes caused by hatred, according to the FBR, increased significantly to 6,628 cases, of which 47,3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Following the fall in 2009, it was alarmed that the number of crimes would again increase, stressing the human rights organization Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, the organization added in the official report.
“Human Rights First stressed long ago that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights,” added one of the leaders of Paul Lejand's organization.
“The American Government may and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this could be done by improving police reports on crimes on the ground of hatred.”
"Accessive access to hate" in the federal law is the consequence of the civil rights struggle.
This law was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality and sexual orientation in our day.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes similar to Facebook
On Monday, the microblog site Twitter made changes in the presentation of its platform that would allow its users to see, in particular, the activity of those who are watching this service on Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and other "name" allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters", Internet users whose messages you follow ("twitts") and those that follow you.
This allows them to know if they publish messages, if they sign on new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "in a small percentage of users in August" before the launch of a wide-ranging network on Monday, AFP stated that Twitter Caroline Penner would be secreted.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as an intuitious enough non-permanent term (RT for re-posting some foreign presence, #followfrieday for recommending other users), is primarily a source of satisfaction to experienced users, thus opening themselves for a wider audience by presenting users something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed this update using Twitter on the Internet.
"It's useless, boring, and censored to mention Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my stream on Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the Golden Rule
The leadership of a large coalition of social and Christian democracies in authority in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budget "gold rule" in a constitution to reduce budget deficits and thus avoid the possible reduction of government credit rating agencies in Austria (three A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrat Verner Fayman himself announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with Austria ' s government debt of 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the upper limit of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's ability to pay only one item, from AAA to AA+, we should pay interest to three billion euros per year more than that, the argument raised by Vice-Cancler and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats Michael Schindelegger.
Austria therefore met the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government needed to reduce budget deficits by the end of 2012 and return to balance-based public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt the rule.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the public budget should be reduced to 0.75 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and the structural deficit of the federal State's federal budget by 2017 should not exceed 0.35 per cent of the GDP per year, and the countries and municipalities should submit balanced budgets.
The purpose of the State debt is to be reduced by 60 per cent of the notes signed by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esikhiko Noda
Threats the new intervention on the currency market
Prime Minister Esikhiko Noda of Japan warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would take new interventions on the currency market if the value of them continued to grow.
We are impressed by how we have done this in the past, when Mr. Noda Senat explained that the exchange rate of iron was excessive.
On Tuesday, June almost a historical note was raised, which encouraged Japan's authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo sold a dollar ring to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had established a new record of power since 1945.
Since then, however, it has grown steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who adopt it as a "relief" in these dark times of global economic downturn and a long crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar dropped down 77 and the euro dropped down the symbolic plane to 105, near the level that led to the last intervention.
The financial crisis in 2008-2009 was estimated at about $120 and more than 160 for the euro.
The growth in Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as Japanese products make more expensive and reduce the income of Japanese foreign companies when converted into national currency.
" Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the earthquake and tsunamis of 11 March, which left the Tohoku region (Northern East), stressed Mr. Noda, who was afraid that this growth would kill a poor restoration heritage.
In the world, the third economy has restored growth in the third quarter of 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - the first year - thanks to the growth of exports and the consumption of households affected by disasters
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yeen does not reflect "the basic economic indicators of Japan".
Minister of Finance John Adami called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened its two-day meeting on monetary policy on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to reduce jealousy.
However, the Deputy Managing Authority of Hirohid Yamaguati warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "relevant steps", which made it clear that no additional mitigation in the environment should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the emitting organization increased to 5,000 million yen (47 billion euros) the purchase of cascade bonds by up to 55,000 million yen (519 million euros) the amount it allocates for the purchase of various financial instruments in order to boost the market in securities.
Eurozone
Growth rates, fund burdens are charged
The risk of damage to the debt crisis undermines European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European banks entered the area on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished trade at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt dropped by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
As a result of new difficulties with the payment of credit to eurozone countries in difficulty, the global financial markets continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
“The worried investors are just too worried about the risk of injury,” explains Terry Prattt, an IG Markets institutional broker quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo strike ended with a drop of 0.7 per cent on the market for new market participants in order to maintain a debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has changed its view on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of late changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has been stabilized," says Mitushiga Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This is a return of concerns about the future Eurozone is a single currency that has continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lower mark for a month.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1,3570, which fell to 0.4 per cent.
According to the Brokers, she followed the meeting of the Chancellor of Angel Merkel HDS on Monday, on which the resolution was adopted, which provided, in particular, an opportunity for the countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italy and Spain rates above 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level.
On Tuesday, 685 per cent of the Italian 10-year-old bond was reached by 685 per cent, while the Spanish bond was 6.2 per cent at the same time as the payment period.
These problems with percentage rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to pose a threat to participants.
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked for time to restore the situation in Italy that was under the threat of a paralyse under his debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papalimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be “the main task” of his Government.
Spain was under the strike of the markets before the parliamentary elections in the resurrection.
A new historical peak was reached between the percentages of the 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain.
Waiting for growth figures in Eurozone
France has increased economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, reviewed the reduction in the second quarter, with a fall in 0.1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
The fourth quarter is most worrying about the economy.
Germany, in its turn, fixed growth by 0.5 per cent for the same period.
The first assessment of the whole euro area is expected on 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facing the Facts
If there is a subject that cannot be decided after a long discussion or under emotional influence, that is an energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that elections become a cause for reflection on the nature and location of nuclear energy.
It will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France should develop its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Now, we have 7 billion people on the planet, demographic development will be a duplicate of electricity demand by 2050, unless only a large part of the world's population remains vital.
During the same period, an increasing resource deficit will be needed to continue to generate electricity, not forgetting the important need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance, which has disappeared from environmental debate.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to withdraw from nuclear energy.
This was not the case of Belgium, which decided to find a source that could replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intended to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add one installation to its set, refurbishing the building of a station that was halted after the accident at Tri-Mill Island.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy sometimes presents an example, the reality is contrary to this argument.
Berlin's election will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, increased demand for gas imports, in particular from Russia, the drop in carbon emissions in relation to the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's turbine construction campaign, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is the same as the largest carbon and gas consumer because of the current wind; hence, carbon gas emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50% higher than in Europe's average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent more for electricity than for French households.
As the global energy price is a key factor in competitiveness and the supply of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from European electricity itself.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will result in a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which makes a very beautiful statement on the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing capacity.
The price that most French refuse to pay is greater because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create a industry industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 focused jobs.
Strongly focused on exports, it attracted the whole range of businesses specialized in international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and created many jobs that could not be transferred to another sector.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice more of these enterprises and lose 6 billion euros per year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer will order EPR to work for 60 years if his manufacturer's closure is planned?
In order to address energy imbalances, it should be recognized that there are no divine or demonic sources of energy production.
The development of Areva's solutions with low carbon, nuclear and renewable greenhouse gas emissions demonstrates the interoperability of energy sources.
The high level of security for nuclear energy is certainly a vital issue for nuclear energy
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our team, which is generally recognized as professionalism, is full of the same security.
Over 50 years, the atomic industry survived three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mill Island, has been operating under normal conditions, but without any impact on the human or the environment
In Montenegro, the reactor device and the inexhaustible human error have led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the disaster has resulted in two natural disasters of unprecedented force that have led to the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this incident as it drew from the two preceding events.
The result of this step and cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that will enable them to withstand such events.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, the halt of its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF to clear their way to lead to the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of sources of energy for our country, but it would be inappropriate to allow emotions, beliefs and manoeuvres to rise to a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a blessing to the economy?
The immigration policy with Nicola Sarkozi was criticized by various parties - overload of police, judicial and administrative services, digital policies and the compatibility of this policy with France's self-reported status as “human rights States”.
Then there was the administrative shock of foreign students who fell into the news when the Minister of Internal Affairs (Liberashon of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talents, stones and officers”.
But it's very rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The rights and the left in this regard are well agreed.
On the right-hand side, Jakom Shirak, who stated in 1976 that "900 000 unemployed will not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left-hand side, Michel Rocker, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from all over the world".
Differences only at the level of generosity
In 2005, fear of entry into the country was felt by the Polish watersman's order and left and right.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for the French society.
The difference is only at the level of generosity that they allow to show to immigrants.
In its French programme, the Netherlands has limited its payroll, saying that "cooperative work will help solve our immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may give an electrical advantage, but it is economically expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffery Cameron remind us in a recent book that published the latest data on immigration (Special people: As migration has shaped our world and determined our future, May 2011, the publication of Princeton University, 352 c.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that adopt immigrants.
Limitation in immigration leads to a weakening of growth and reduced employment.
Immigrant attacks are based on the assumption that they can replace local workers, especially underqualified, by reducing wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants actually do much more than replace local labour force with jobs that do not have local labour force.
Non-qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour force, and the most qualified are in dynamic sectors where education is not linked to proposals for work.
Negative impact on payments
Just as surgery would be difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetics, complementing existing among local and immigrant immigrants has a positive effect on the wage of local workers.
Joanni Perry estimated that 1% of the migration flows would result in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9% of the actual long-term payments.
This is without the fact that the diversity introduced by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (in the midst of the U.S. Nobel Prize for Naturalized Immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also benefit from the social security system by providing 1 per cent of the total budget of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, an immigrant in Germany, who is 30 years old, would have a net government budget (per capita income) of EUR 150,000 for his life.
Nicole Sarcosi, at the beginning of his mandate, gathered teeth to fall into a lack of growth.
The mentioned teeth used to scare immigrants had a negative effect.
Europe has chosen democracy, and the European democracy remains to be imagined
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time, it is a weak one.
The European continent must remember that, having gained it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century, it survived the tragedy of World War I, Taoist regimes, Holocaust, Gougata, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some believed that democracy would ultimately turn against its enemies, put enough vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon "Malago" it has been known that this is from the surface of thought.
The general vote, although it is a mandatory condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be a "delegation tool", as the philosopher Stephen Vashro once said.
No, democracy requires much more than public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we live in is a economic crisis, but firstly it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the true and false Greek referendum will have a double disparagement effect, demonstrating the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant sense of its incompatibility and incompatibility.
This duality needs to be taken into consideration in order to overcome it.
The fact is that the front line of the fight against democracy has now moved, and many believe that the Republican soldiers are now not in that direction.
We do not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as a matter of convenience and in a hootitical manner.
The Cart-Blansh for an absolute European monarch or a pair of related legs in the loss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we don't think about the flexibility of gluten, but about the implementation of a common, clear and permanent choice and democracy, at this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the extent to which they are still to be listed, because there is only one crisis -- the crisis in Europe.
All of Europe is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is devastated at an international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of European sovereignty, but Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty and, together with it, every one of its nations.
The management of the European project should be restored rapidly under popular sovereignty.
Because only joint Europeans can reduce the burden of each individual, release from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in them.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at the overall European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us into disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jako Delor are still demanding the European Economic Government.
Let's do it.
But to represent itself without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that goes on in life is a real folly and a new puzzle.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "represent" the Republicans.
The revolution of interests would be insufficient.
The lesson remains true.
We must build a Europe that is one at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, which is now the people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Inconsistencies in chips are being spread.
The World Chip Map exhibition is opened on Tuesday in Wilpente under Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 11 per cent of global microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM cards) will end in 2011, over 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important non-contact technology sector, which allows public transport or procurement, simply to carry out a card on the machine.
In that year, 460 million wireless chip cards will be sold in the world against 320 million years ago!
Their share grew in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and accounted for nearly 10 per cent of the world market chip card (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been away from the Asia-Pacific region for a long time, is now moving forward in the field of non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided with this function, and they are received by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting with a more modest position: 400,000 non-contact cards of Visa are available.
But many stores are increasing paces.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million non-contact Pass MasterCard.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to provide their customers with equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have promised to regularly distribute bank cards that are available for offline use among their clients in the future,” reported Zérar Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using the mobile phone.
But it's just the first phase of the future of payment, it's a mobile phone.
Only a few devices are equipped with NFC technology (Communication of a nearby field) needed to carry out such transactions.
"They were abandoned.
"But they have to fly now in the next year."
"We count on world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are going ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June in Canada.
The iPhone equipment will provide approximately 200 customers and staff with cables to provide wireless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal that would allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spread from Sahrai to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of Islamic Maghreb to the sect of Boco Haram.
The long anticipated link between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sector was confirmed.
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians are now convinced of this.
“The methods used by these two organizations and the secret services reports show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained without giving details.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation of two French refugees in Niger revealed two related names in January.
The people who were kidnapped in the Niamey restaurant near Aqmi, Antuan de Leokur and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the following day, along with several of the refugees during the operation carried out by the French apartheid.
Among the gaps left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sym-cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
An analysis of the phone calls showed several colleagues in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators were particularly interested in two numbers; one pointed to a Nigerian who lived in Maydigree, a city in northern Nigeria, along with Boco Haram, and the other, to a man, as it is claimed, near Aqmi and to the sect.
"This step forward, but certainly more reliable evidence must be expected before it comes to the operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sector is receiving financial and ideal support outside and that it is becoming more and more active, says the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amovo.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and in its methods, which now include the use of deaths and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, in its head with Washington, is now pressureing Abuja to pay attention to the problems created by Boco Haram.
It was because the Nigerian authorities traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who were not interested.
The Great Success
Based in Maydigri in 2002 on the hope, school, and the foundationist Mohamed Yusufe, Boko Haram - which means "the Western education is sin" - preachs the establishment of an Islamic era in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It was politicalized and demanded strict observance of the Sheria, and its activists began to fight against the corrupt central government.
It is primarily intended for churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists of Boko Haram were particularly active, carrying out numerous attacks on police offices.
Abuji's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
And (remember) Muhammad Yusuf (Joseph) was killed while he was in prison.
The sector is now radicalized and will go beyond its northern flows.
In the past, she took responsibility for the action that resulted in the killing of 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June in Abuja Boko Haram organized the first murder attack at a strengthened police headquarters.
In August the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which comes from Mauritania through Nigeria, in Somalia, is now concerned by all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger, while Somalis from Al-Shabaab are active in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, at a meeting with Presidents, Mr. Gudlak, Jonathan Allen Juppe warned of the danger of Boco Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
Peace as can be seen by Republican candidates in presidential elections
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they are embroiled in simplification and incompetence.
Can America’s crisis be weakened by a complex peace with simple, more precise ideas?
If the candidates were to listen to the presidents of the Republicans, the voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been many, but the details of the foreign policy that are traditionally a strong party to the Republicans.
Lazungs, China, Iran and Israel's assistance are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romni, whose best chances of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened to appeal to the Chinese in the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency - a sensitive issue for America, which was exposed to migration from all sectors of its industry in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama in China, and the only candidate who understood the complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome the emotional turmoil.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama).
But Huntsman, who lives in the lower part of the ratings, remains unheard of.
In Reygan's style
Romania also pledged military attacks on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stay with Iran, he'll come back."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance by accusing Obama of breaking promises in connection with that partner.
Herman Cain, the second in the applicant's ratings, demonstrated an inconsistency of the case.
He recently called against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing was trying to gain nuclear power - obviously not knowing that China had it since 1964!
The Governor of Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, said he was ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug dealers.
It is also recommended that Cain, Perry and the candidate Michel Bahman avoid the persecution of suspects of terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009.
All of this is far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McKayna, a heavy foreign policy.
The opposition of the current President is responsible for having simple ideas and for winning a cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone with regard to the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his innovative dialogue with Iran, the pre-eminent conclusion of Iraq, his catches in Libya, which brought him a reputation for a weak policy.
But it's not that simple.
The people considered the positive balance of national security with Obama, which had eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that binds to sand.
And, affirming that America needs to be restored economically to restore its leadership, Obama's rights.
North Pole, new voices for Russian gas entry into Europe.
The North-West Europe and Russia are being launched by gas, directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
It is calculated on the supply of gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to release this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic shores, between the orchestra and the search for meals, in the opening of the North Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under water.
German Chancellor Angel Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister of France Fion and his Dutch colleague Mart Rutte, together returned a symbolic valve controlling the Russian gas flow into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will be held each year in Western Europe for the first round of 1,224 km, joining the Leningrad region with the countries of Meklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to the entire consumption of France.
The possibility of setting up a third pipeline towards the same direction has already been discussed.
The timely completion of this enormous project is a victory for Gaza.
The project met with bitter opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Pole will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding transit through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to the Western European markets.
At the most pressing moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stand in line with the new German-Soviet Pact, with a view to occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
With the support of the Russian project, Western Europe has gained greater security of its supplies.
But Europe's cost of losing energy is because the project has created a barrier between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to gain understanding of the direct link between Russia and the rich western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already in progress.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," said France Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent major gas contracts are important and politically and economically.
All of this explains the broad gap between the Heads of the Gasproma, who attended a large number in Lubmin, the gas station.
The weapons of this gas pipeline are also a technical drive.
The undercrowd is made of a concrete building to protect it from the waves of ships.
He's on the beach day, on the middle of 200 meters deep.
To build it, it had to cover the mine fields remaining with the second world war.
"The shadow had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jans Mueller, the secretary of the North Pole company.
It was also necessary to take a lot of steps to protect the fungus and flora.
It is a long metallic snake with a weight equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel Bays, with no cuts all along it, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers rejected it because Sweden was not in a position to ensure that the Russian public company would always live in its borders.
"In the event of an accident, we're closing the gas flow less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So in case of gas leaks in the gas pipeline, they go into the air.
However, this is true of small-scale structures that have designed wells that are calculated only once per 100,000 years.
The gas flow control shall be carried out by a submarine holding the ship for external monitoring as well as by an incinerator.
The safety device shall be inserted within a diameter of 1 m and shall be placed in front of the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at 3 metres per second, it shall provide accurate information on any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for a smaller repair.
The circulation of gas is carried out only by pressure.
It consists of 200 bar at departure and 100 bar at arrival.
Five companies combined efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51 per cent of the capital.
The remaining are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9 per cent each).
The five companies established a joint venture called the North Pole, which was commissioned to build and operate gas pipelines.
Its headquarters is located in Cuge, Switzerland, where taxes are particularly favourable.
After that, Gazprom gave the company a 20-year lease with the possibility of extending the total amount of gas transport.
“The gas will be paid in full, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Mueller.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of work is 7.4 billion euros per two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be around 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are confident that they will earn their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea, in Lubmin, on a sandy beach surrounded by sick trees.
The windmills form the output terminal of the gas.
Detonators measure pressure, temperature and specific gas characteristics before switching it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
In full power, this will be 3 million in an hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine brand block
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will return to the letter.
He's got a lot of closures, hours that were written in the light of the candle.
The Moleskine block is easy to find out about the direct black environment, about the risk, about the yellow-white pages, which are the ones you want with time.
However, the book Moleskine, which we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company in Milan decided to start selling design blocks.
Maria Sebregondi, then company consultant, took responsibility for starting a new product.
The block is inspired by the old manufacturing technique, a molecular-laden boy-bombum fabric used, for example, to cover the camé.
It is confirmed that this type of blockade is highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought in with today's taste an old and forgotten thing that was a culture for Hungarian artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager brand in Modo Modo.
It's been a success.
Sales increased by 25 per cent from 2006 to 2010 and reached 12.7 million stocks.
We went far from the production of the first years when 3,000 blocks were made.
Moleskine moved to Italy and was exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
Set the typical buyer's profile is heavy, because the blockade likewise attracts businessmen, students and free professionals.
The buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitical, they have a wide range of views and education.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 staff, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It spread its blockades in the Fnac library stores, shops in small towns, and was able to obtain extensive knowledge.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need in writing, despite the appearance of an e-mail,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic of culture is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently the brand organized the exhibition “Environment Path”, where architects and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched an air-conditioning facility for a cinematographic event in Locarno.
Using its achievements and cultural aura, Moleskine has varied its products that now include bags, hands, bags for computers. Brand includes all kinds of support.
Success that was due: Modo Modo was bought in June 2006 by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now syntegra Capital, which has written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the rate of unemployment among workers with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of work for persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite public welfare policy, the proportion of unemployment among persons with disabilities is still twice the average, i.e. 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
He's out of his mind?
“No, - stresses Eric Blanche, Director-General Adapt, an organization that organises the week of work of persons with disabilities.”
"There will be significant progress for 15 years."
"At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not 2 but 3 times more."
"But there's still a lot of work to do."
It must be said that there is still much to be done for persons with disabilities.
Among them are older: 37 per cent aged 50 (17 per cent).
They have a lower level of qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a balava level, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, a very widespread long-term unemployment rate is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities versus 38 per cent on average.
In addition, all these criteria that are very difficult to get back to work and that pose a problem," says Christian Grapena, Director-General Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire workers with disabilities.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about the mind that changes but is too slow.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprenere Association on Cité's command showed that the questioned managers had a low level of knowledge of disability and “presented themselves as ordinary people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled”.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6 per cent of workers with disabilities under the legislation adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 represent 2.6 per cent.
"We are about 3 per cent today," said Pierre Blan, Director General Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “paid” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased from 59 000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which imposed tax, created a strong pressure on the company, explains Pierre Blan."
“But this improvement also reflects awareness growth, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the workers from 20 to 49 had workers with disabilities against 82 per cent of the workers from 100 to 199.
Assassin: "What luck?"
Before meeting with Sinim on Tuesday (20.45 p.m.) Eden Asar and George Leytos did not hide the satisfaction they had received from this friendly match.
We don't come up to claim that there was a secret conversation between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting around the ranks of the ranks of Stade de France, George Leytos and Eden Azar died.
Five months later, after his attack on Turkey, the Belgian trainer could only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his movement and the fact that he's white."
'I want to go further,' said the game Lille.
The only difference between his achievements in the club and in the collection is that he's justified.
"I'm in Lille for a year, and there's nothing in Belgium."
"I've got to get my boots."
Left in the stock, in front of this match with France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Asar came to San-Denya to end her "blow."
I don't forget, however, about the concept of "satisfaction."
He supported the Sins from 7 years old and successful campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also strengthens the particular character of this match.
And on the other hand, there are Matthew, John, and Adil (Rome), on the other hand."
"Our roads have just moved."
"To have the chance to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leyance well remembered about pride.
"Hordy" to play in "an empty mother."
"Gorginess" also affirms as "the neighbor", that France has again become a very high-level commander, all over the year after the trauma in Nazne.
"Lorran Blan was like a lot of hits, he wakes up.
Now, when Belgium passes the next Euro, a technical sportsman will fly in one plane with the leadership of the sons... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little whites are growing up," he stressed.
"We build something, games ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will believe in this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself
Portugal, Paul Bentu, begins its reply to Bosnia (22 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon with a great optimism.
On his way, the two teams, it was said, lost the sense of reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Bentu is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt in his mind that the Assembly, which has been in its role since September 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal's 90 minutes of luck.
But there's a match to play, and Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in the garden of Zenica, it's clear that the game isn't over.
Although Portugal had been ruling for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the promising goal that would bring her peace.
"It is a good result, however, which will lead to a certain risk."
But, in their bright-lighted de la Luis stadium in Lisbon, Portuguese are convinced that they will walk in front of the audience, which must be in the corner, even though the mat will be very tense," said an optimistic, but judged Bentu.
"We are waiting for a very busy match, but we are convinced that we can win," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of being on Euro 2012," said translator Carlush Keirosh.
Nothing on Friday in the fight against Bosnia is required by Portuguese winners.
There's nothing I could do to build the Bosnians.
"That's a good result, however, some risk - Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team with many technical values and games with many individual values," he added.
As had been in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to make maximum pressure on Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think."
The good idea is that this time it would be realistic.
