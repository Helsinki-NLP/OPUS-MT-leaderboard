The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed the Act on Administrative Responsibility for the violation of the terms and conditions of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very serious problem of failure to fulfil its obligations to contractors in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two more years ago, when entrepreneurs were unable to obtain payment for public and municipal contracts already completed, the situation was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Attorney-General to take the issue of special control.
Since businessmen themselves were unable to deal with inadvertent contractors who had not been financed by contracts, they were all trying to remove their obligations to pay and include illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was system-wide in the country.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand submissions have been submitted for the protection of the right of entrepreneurs to pay for public prosecutorial orders and 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to the administration of 533 in the investigation bodies for the organization of the trial of 75 material and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, debt to entrepreneurs was reduced to over 66 billion rubles.
These large amounts have been cut far from the cost of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Many systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have led to reasonable debt.
Here's the case.
The leader of a small company won a competition for social transport services on several million rubles.
Man has put all his means of transport, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but he has not received the money in time.
As a result, the growing financial income from payments, taxes, loans would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought assistance from the procurator.
The problem has now reached a maximum level in a number of regions.
However, as at the first half of 2017, the total debt on public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation was approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor is working in a hand-held anti-crisis management regime.
The Prosecutor-General personally attends meetings with representatives of the local authorities, which are specifically understood by all prosecutors involved in the violations and immediate removal of them.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg this year.
It would be useful to improve the public prosecutor's payment discipline in the implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ "To amend the Russian Federation Code on Administrative Offences in the establishment of the administrative responsibility of officials for the violation of the term and order of payment of goods (work and services) in the procurement of public and municipal needs", signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Economic Affairs, on the initiative of the Genocorator.
The new Act will complement the Russian Federation Code on Administrative Offences, which provides for a fine of 30 000 to 50 000 rubles for the violation of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, it is expected to be disabled for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislation in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced the advance warning to the Mission
The National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Coloured Population has issued a warning to the colorful people travelling in Missouri, due to the discriminatory state policy and racist attacks.
The Group ' s statement is: “A warning to travel to the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colorful People, which was effective until 28 August 2017, calls on African Travellers, guests and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise greater caution in the travel of the state due to a number of suspicious developments on the basis of the recent developments in the territory of the state and the areas covered here.”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Coloured Population, the advance warning of the movement of a group has recently been a law adopted by the Mission which has made it more difficult for people to overcome discrimination-related demands, as well as that the law enforcement authorities of the state are not often elected by their minority representatives.
“You are under a violation of human rights.
They remain on the streets because of the color of the skin, they kill and kill them," said the Kansas City Star, Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Color of the Mission.
"We hear complaints often as never before."
This is the first warning of such an organization in relation to the state of the United States.
The group was involved in such incidents as the defeat of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year, after he had completed gas on his trip to the state, and the police arrested him, without accusing him of committing a crime.
The warning also refers to the recent report of the Prosecutor General of the State of Missouri, which states that it is likely to remain on the road for black leaders at 75 per cent higher than for whites.
“The aim of warning people of the situation and of warning their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri”, said Chapel.
“People must be prepared in such a way or otherwise, whether they take money for the loan or inform their relatives of their travel to the State territory.”
According to the latest FBR reporting programme on hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were registered in the Mission in 2015 and are committed by the State of sixteen such violations.
The prevention of movement is also a response to the new law of the State of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to raise a case against a legal person in relation to housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) announced warnings for travel on Texas and Arizona after these countries adopted new immigration control laws, which required local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, in the opinion of ACLU, had to increase the number of checks on racial grounds.
Prevention of movement is usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but public organizations have recently achieved this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two men were killed as a result of a police patrol strike in Egypt
An unknown police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna reported Reuters with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed, three were injured.
All the wounded are brought to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two of the armed men in the car were opened by fire guards.
One of the criminals was arrested, and the other managed to hide.
Rosturism upholds the law on the abolition of free warehouses for non-refoulement aircraft
The Head of Rosturisma Oleg Safonov, in the interview with the RBC, stated that "a positive" concerns the adoption of the law on the abolition of free transportation of luggage by non-portable aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions where a person who has no luggage can buy a child's ticket unless he has a bag," he stressed (the TASC quote).
Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the threat of citizens, it was not possible to pay for the carriage of upper clothing and mobile phones in hand.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and to declare it, to say that it's on top, on the phone, on the phone, on the trip or even on any computer of relationship," said the head of Rosturism.
Former Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law which provides for the right of airlines to exclude the free movement of luggage from the air carrier.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of places and bags included in the free tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered the removal of the Beekala invasion
President Vladimir Putin of Russia at the Baikal Protection Meeting reported that in recent years the major areas of the lake had suffered extreme pollution.
It instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and executions for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered the full cultivation of contaminated areas.
"We must also deal with the objects that continue to work here, most of them clean weapons are carried out," said the president's RIA News.
He also added that the General Prosecutor General of Russia should carry out an environmental verification.
He said that there were problems in the area of the lake with natural disasters and a number of environmental violations on the part of respiratory organizers.
"I would like to emphasize this: not only is it necessary to check, but it is also necessary to know, but, namely, illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, the Geneva Office had reported on the reduction of stocks of fish in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
Recall that, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin stated in the direct line that it was necessary to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural areas of special security.
He was informed of the problems of economic activity on the island of Olkhon, which is part of the natural territory of the Baikal.
The Prime Minister of Sergei Donsk immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baykal area, but the Government of Burkina Faso recalled that such changes were insufficient, as restrictions were linked to a number of regulatory acts.
Previously, the Economic and Social Committee had proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A New Temple in South Korea
In the village of Sosova, members of the community of indigenous minority peoples of North Rhineland, together with the inhabitants of the Berezev region, took part in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the Saint Nicholas the Great.
His location is the river bank, the temple will be well seen, so he will serve the fish as a means of transporting fish.
According to community representatives, construction work has been completed this year, and now the dome has been established, there are churches.
The ILEB fleet was accompanied by transport.
The temple is named after the Holy One, Nicolaus the Great, because it is considered to be a righteous church as a minister of travelers, including fishermen.
In the Council, fishing is a work for the people, and it will cut them off.
The local people wait for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it at school as a place of local appreciation.
Disneilled with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore obey the laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air restaurant.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang steals one cigarette for another, while the surgeons carefully collects the iron box from the office.
After the end of the meeting, the businessman is headed to the nearest corner - up to a hundred meters - and he selects bees there.
Muscle damage in the public area is 500 local dollars, reports Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex since I was a kid: I can't throw a ghost out of a bridge, they're currently out of the way.
And now it's all over the video camera.
And indeed, Singapore's trottoriums are in the center of the city, which is in the museum.
Chang relates that three months ago, his 18-year-old son, who was a neighbor, had painted a wall of an old colonial building.
The court recognized the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to trial.
What?!
Imagine yourself.
He got ten hits of a wooden stick on his knees and spent a week in prison.
We don't even have physical punishment.
As Singapore's highest standard of living and incredibly hard laws were incorporated, the suspect "AIF" was found on the scene.
There's no one here who wants to cancel the death penalty, explains attorney Victor Lee Hong.
The Government has long been thinking of both the European Union and the United States in this regard.
If a person carries a lot of drugs or sells them, he's got a visa.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at the Changi Airport, with 400 g of cocaine.
In his defense, the Australian Prime Minister was threatened by sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
However, the boys in the race were all alike.
After that, the drug dealers are trying hard to force our country.
The following: Singapore states that the laws are required to comply with the SCE, not only with humble and poor people.
It doesn't matter who you are as a millionaire, a vice president, a famous artist or a resident of the Eurojust.
The option in this case is one: if you have a cup of cocaine, you're going to get more.
When you go to Singapore and you're meeting with dog warnings everywhere, you're just a miracle - how many bans in this city!
For example, the risk of breast cancer is sold only in appetites, and it can be bought strictly on prescription (!) by a doctor.
The tourist is not allowed to take a walk, but it should be placed at a rate of 1 thousand local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white tables on the hat, "I'm tired."
In addition to the sandy sandy urchin, there are often "links to the yard": a week to pick up parks and beaches.
Six thousand rubs are paid by a “drugist” who forgets his drinking water in the public toilet, and when he tries to fix a little need in the elevator of the house, he's working with a special detector, locking the door and sending a signal to the police.
Among all the exegetical laws are prohibitions on the smoothing of the street, public performance of the song and even excessive flooring of the room (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts camels.
In order to avoid the fires of smokers, it is not possible to carry any cracks in the metro, otherwise it is estimated that 5,000 syngaporous baxons.
In general, the idea seems to be: as long as you try, you're bound to break something.
That's not true, trying to convince me that Muhammad Kabir Kajariya, the owner of the local community.
In particular, the fantastic laws exist only on the books, and for the last twenty years, I haven't seen anyone get involved in their violations.
Why do they stay?
That the citizens did not weaken.
The compliance with the basic rules is inexhaustible.
Let's say that if a minor sells a cigarette to a smoker, he's gonna be punished all over a cup of tea: the store owner pays a huge sum, the offender himself gets a hit by the bars on the back part, and the sellers are also fired and thrown into prison.
That's because of so many serious crimes laws in Singapore.
Is that right?
In the 1970 ’ s, we had a chaos on the streets. Automobiles ignored the lights, walked as if they wanted to grow up drinking on the street.
After the tax year was introduced, it all calmed down.
Now the driver, who drank a glass of whiskey, knows that if they stay, the police are not allowed to take charge, they pay taxes on the cost of the apartment, and they run a net for years.
Many foreigners of the city-state in South-East Asia appear to be the diversity of conciliatory.
In 1993, American writer William Gibbson called Singapore "Disneiland with the death penalty" -- a guest from the United States who had brought the total wealth of the inhabitants, the "purifying airport" and the "cultural nature".
Such things are not natural, they are artistic, and they should not be in principle.
The first few days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a bag on a truck, you'll be able to catch up if you're in the subway with the seam.
But then you're going to the Small India area, and the other is the "distributed template": plastic stoppers are thrown in the bus stop.
"How is that?" you wonder.
And that's how Singaporeans laugh.
It's all there.
Not every such crime will come to light, but you must know that if you are called to account, you will not desist, for you have violated the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to be normal.
Of course, Singapore's authority is completely authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Hoshimin, I moved very carefully -- motorcyclists often get off the hands of smartphones and camera tourists.
In the center of Paris, there were plenty of dirty bombs and requests.
We're not trying to throw a mouse in our streets either.
Singapore has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on earth, thanks to the collection of dragons and innocents.
You're thinking.
Such a human nature: remember, and in Russia no one has stepped for a role until the strike.
Although Singapore's chief is not paying taxes, it is voluntary law.
And we should think that in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, the absence of bridges in the subway, and the arrest of those traveling the elevator with the public toilet.
That's the physical punishment, thanks, no.
The rest of Singapore's laws are at least to be seen.
Nothing holy?
Now the White House Trumpa is headed for the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of change in the regime is when it starts to fight the stats.
The Americans understand this little bit worse than all the others - from this point of view, the theoretical summary of Saddam Hussein's status in the field of Firdos in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Government's key ideologists, no doubt knew what he had done when he had taken a symbolic tour of the State of Freedom during a heated debate with journalist CNN Jim Acoston on the president's proposals for a radical reduction in legal migration.
I'll be honest, Miller didn't try on his own.
He would have been deprived of the privileges of the owners of the propagandistic ships and artists representing the Statute of Freedom if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to reason with her, and especially with the thought recorded in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed when the text of Emma Lazarus was added.
As Miller said to Acosta, "I don't want to go into history here, but the status of freedom is... the symbol of American freedom, which brings peace.
The creation you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Statute of Freedom."
Miller was right about the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This is about the present sound of Lazarus's words, the only ones in which the State calls not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your risers, your poor, / your crowd who wish to wake up freely, / the unfortunate eruptions of your troubled shores."
I've never seen the "misleading explosions" in our screens before.
Miller didn't do literature, he realized that these people in the Americas were not waiting.
This debate on the meaning of the status is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a debate on the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friend, who fought to put her word around the statue after her death, were very well aware that they were carrying out a perfectly political act.
The sculpture should have been marked by a link between the French and American republics through the Banana Classic Picture of the Women of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her mind: The female figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Evicted.
The integration of the movement and image was a devastating feminist move and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, they have the right to change it back.
The famous Rash Limbo, of his kind, John Crister, who came to Trampa, in 2010, argued that Freedom does not appeal to anyone, rather it is an early non-conservative, that the American flame of peace is going on.
It holds the flag of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Facal is not needed in order to open the way to the United States."
In contrast to Limbo's treatment, it's actually a point.
The meaning of the article depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would see potential, unhappy, but full hopes of people on board ships after long and often heavy ships.
This means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
We answer the words of hope and hospitality that they hope to hear.
And, of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to admit.
Their falcons need not reveal the way, but they must overcome hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Championship: Nil Blake highly prizes the Scottish members of the UK Assembly.
Ellid Doyle remembers when there were only two johns in the UK.
Nil Blake, director of the United Kingdom's easy-to-game game, said that a total of 16 people from Scotland's World Championships would make a "great contribution to the team's game".
The record number of Scottish light aircraft was selected at the launch of the 2017 London Championship on Friday.
Bleek believes that in Scotland, "something special" is born and the United Kingdom's easy-to-fly airport must be taken into account.
"We know this and we try to understand and support it until they have the potential," said Blake.
"I talked to people at the Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Federation believes that they have to work because of what they did.
The British Federation is a simple athlete: they have to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances are going on, but that's really embarrassing."
Some of the Scottish light aircraft are on the medals, including Laura Myr and Andrew Bacert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5000 m; and Ellid Doyle, the team selected its captain.
"Elid disgraces.
Her capital thing was great," says Blake.
“Many of the easy flights, regardless of whether they are or not, and where they live or are trained, come out of this room, feeling proud and proud to win.
The passions and sincere feelings that Elyde has put into it have been remarkable.”
The owner of the Serbian medals of the Society's campaign, which on its fifth World Championship, runs 400 m with obstacles, says 16 Scottish people in the British Assembly are “unbelievably”.
The previous record of the number of Scottish people at the World Championship was equal to seven in 1983 and 2005.
In the past, Laura Myr, who specializes in the middle of the distance and has attended five British and two European records last year.
She's running at 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who is going to take part in the distance at 1500 m, is another Scottish who needs to pay attention to it: at the back of his successful season, in which the victory of the British collective and annual summits has been won.
Doyle recalls his first champion of peace when, besides her, the only Scottish in command was Li McConnell.
The captain of the team said that she was “unbelievably proud” because so many of her colleagues not only went to the assembly but, in some cases, they would demand medals and fight for the final.
"The head of the collection is chosen by other members of the team, so it was, in any case, a great honor, but knowing that your friends voted for you and you chose, it was a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who have come to the meeting.
This shows how much we got.
And they're all easy-to-be-to-be-to-be.
What about my captain's words?
Yeah, I think she was bad.
I just drew attention to the fact that it was very exciting for us to take up the home of the Peace Championship.
So it's just about how important it is to get patient support and to use what we're going to go back to the Olympic Stadium.
I've got another chance to get into his apartment and participate in funerals, and the atmosphere will just be remarkable.”
Blogging on Facebook: You don't have to go to public office unless you're ready to listen to the criticism from the voters
The founder of our country understood this critical pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that did not prevent them from criticising him for all of his internal policies to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, broke down.
But he was not attracted to his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "We can take the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the blind, lead as a shepherd to war."
Now I'm going to the Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogana's victims were blocked and shot by at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union of Civil Liberties placed it in court.
The undersigned Governors called this search invalid, and comments on the Internet were written in the spirit of "no and nothing".
"It's just Facebook," many say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to Hogan's guy.
He is an amazingly popular republican governor in the democratic rule of state.
He's in the second place in the ratification of approval among 50 Governors of the country.
Hogan is not an open reaction.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the administration of the state and commitment to its principles.
It also uses Facebook as a primary means of communication with its voters and with jokes shows its skin on its side after chemotherapy.
That is why to block people who come to the governor's side, which is declared a public forum and is held by government officials on the money of taxpayers, is unnecessary and ultimately valuable.
In the Washington Post interview, the press secretary Amelia Ches protected the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolleys, spammers and heathers that damage the Internet.
Post spoke to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And that's the real people, not the trolleys, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor who's calling on their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were honorable, contented and not gross.
The pastor quoted the Bible, referring to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakschmi Sarma Ramana of Bouai, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about crimes on the ground of hate.
“I have written an exhilarating comment that I am disappointed at the lack of response to the crimes committed on the ground of hatred and other recent news”, she wrote in the commentary to the article on Post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say that it’s so-called abbreviation instead of acknowledging that they have a case with a large group of disadvantaged citizens.”
The fact that the underprivileged Governors refer to the "concentrated spam-taque", others would probably be referred to as "the active living position".
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking criticism or by making negative comments.
This is much less painful than before when people were asked to send, collect, and burn newspapers with critical fronts, or arrest and arrest the protestors.
But that's what's going on right now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not listening to Facebook and other Web sites.
President Trampu was asked by Twitter users who were banned in his Twitter account.
One of the first reverse decisions on this topic was adopted this week in Virginia.
In the opinion of the United States District Judge of Alexandria, James K. Kesheris, the President of the Watch Tower Society of Laudon violated the First Amendment, forgetting the elector in his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Governor of the Republic, Matt Bawein, submitted claims to the American Union for protection of civil freedom for his conduct on Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be that hard.
In Washington, the age of available mail costs was about the same as today's Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourth, and the authors of anonymized letters greatly corrupted their authority.
And even then Washington had an anonymity trolls.
People under the titles "Urikola", "Valerius", "Beliseris" and "Portius" wrote letters in Washington, D.C.
According to the historical documents collected online by the document of George Washington, his office was seized by applications that criticised his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Maritime.
But he didn't try to keep them hidden.
Freedom of speech, incompetence and expression is based on our State itself.
And true leadership means agreeing with that.
Ronan Rafferti is looking for housing facilities at the Renessans Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferti is expected to be at home for the next three days when the Renessans Club in Estonia will host twenty-fifth open Scottish golf course for older athletes.
A North-West of Ireland, who led a meeting at the Archerfield Links Club, and moved to the final round last year before Paul Ilsu left, joined the new place and served as the representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
"I saw how the Renessans Club was built, and we see how it works with this event," said Rafferti.
“The games will see this field at its best, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job, putting this place down.
He's a bright fan of this game and he's proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
English Ils is waiting for the chance to stand for the champion's title for the first time, despite his 32-year-old career in the European Tour, and in the European Challenge Tour.
"It's really a special feeling," said a game from Southport.
“I failed to try to win Extramadura Open again, because it was removed from the schedule over the year after I won it.
Returning to this angle of peace is ridiculous.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and my wife, Sharon, and I have been greatly impressed by the triumph of the past year.
This was truly a special time, and we will always remember it."
He returned to the country of his family, Gerry Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he had served 50 years earlier this year.
This event will be his first appearance in Scotland at the time of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play home, it's always a little more important," said the resident Helensboro Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel that extra burden."
I played with great pleasure again, and I showed a bad golf course.
I'm satisfied with how long till it's done."
In the field, the former masters tournament winner Yen Vousnem and the senior sports champions Paul Brodherst, Roger Chepman, Mark James and Mark McKnalty were joined.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup, Sam Torrance, are two of the six Scottish people in the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven McCalister, Bill Longmeyer and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and the park is 5 pounds per hour, if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds, if the person is two and more.
All income is going to the British Free Hand Fund.
British roads are learning to collect harmful emissions
The custom tunnels over the Masters, which are capable of putting carbon dioxide out of the vehicles, are already tested on the streets of Great Britain.
The country's transport agency, as reported by Autocar, reported positive results of a 100-metre-tonnes test established in one of six north-east countries.
Tunnels of 6 metres are built from some new polymer materials capable of absorbing the harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the establishment of a network of such tunnels is only part of the vast measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, English is about to expand the network of power stations, undertake a number of road-reducing activities, increase the use of commercial transport on electricity, and modernise the heavy cargo park.
According to official statistics, the fourth of all pollutions of the atmosphere is due to transport, and the adverse air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev on the penalty
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamaev, who had been sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubs.
This is reported by the TASS.
Previously, the prosecutor had asked the court to replace the sentence by explaining its request that Mamae's disease “stops his being in prison”.
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for his crimes as a former fighter.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at an exit meeting in SIZO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian " gold earth"
Ready for dinner, Bardina Degei doesn't use the plate.
It's even worse.
In his wooden house in Enaratoli, the capital of Panyay, in the heart of the Indonesian province of Papu, the housewife usually places a sweet cardboard called "not" right in the eye.
In the long run, they will be able to reach and eat the unsatisfied and unsatisfied.
Dagei is sitting on the ground floor, she has no furniture, and here she is doing her work on the house, just like a shower of soft water from a nearby well.
The fireman's in the room without a cross.
She was younger than her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the fields.
The crowd is scattered here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many are drinking, and still there are soldiers.
"No one decides to go to the forest after five nights," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the daily life in the Upper Papua, an old Dutch colony that was joined in Indonesia in 1969 after a suspicious referendum, when only 1026 elders were able to vote in favour of the occupying forces.
The existing movement of independence from the Netherlands quickly provoked its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strict control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua and the independent State of Papua New Guinea took part in the eastern part of the island.
Enaratolli is a city as far as destroyed; the road here includes a semi-trailer passage from Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, Nabir, and then a five-hour drive market.
There's no public transport here.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, is made up of wooden houses covered with balconies; the grasses from the graffiti have been washed in various rice fields.
There was a little welcome here from the Indonesians, I'm not talking about journalists anymore, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, my popes worshiped God in the name of Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
“We were unusually wearing this dress,” says Degei, pointing to his bright, handy prison, dark dress, and a bright ruby.
“We used to wear only sheets of paper.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live in extreme poverty, and the levels of child mortality and literacy among the poor in Asia.
But it's still an Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold miner, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran in Phoenix, is located at the rate of six hundred thousand from Pania, the highest province of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015, the company Freeport received about $3.1 billion in gold and silver here.
The Addendum of Papua can be appreciated by the stocks of forests valued at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, is one tragedy for the popes, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia continue to be present here.
According to a New York Times survey in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units, including up to $150,000.
The need for greater autonomy on the part of the popes threatens the existence of this gold house and is sadly lacking.
According to the human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 popes have been killed by the Indonesian military forces and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the indigenous peoples of Papua, in the 1970s, can be considered a genocide.
In the past year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3300 peaceful protestors in the region.
“We are losing everything”, a report published in 2016 by the United Kingdom of Great Britain contains evidence of the acts committed in the past year, such as impunity, torture, particularly as confirmed in another report, rape and eviction, and the cruel execution of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, as events take place every week,” says Andreas Harrison, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Hague has slowed down, as the resources of Papua have attracted the flow of immigrants from other areas of Indonesia.
The population of the province is 83 per cent of Christians, but demographic indicators are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the indigenous Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Slovenia.
The Javan lavender, varungi, sells a hot chicken and mixs the fruit of the gadoo-gado, which is served with the arasis sauce.
Locals are trying to maintain competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and eggs on the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abbot Yo, a 20-year-old teacher of Panya, who moved to Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, because of her work.
“Because of this, the indigenous peoples of Papu – Mama (women) of Papua lost their market of arrival.”
Indonesia's President, Joko Vidodo, who was known to the people as Jokovi, was motivated by inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Chamber in Jakarta, an ex-combatant volunteered to support 27 of the 29 Pope’s rounds, including the Panya.
In Papua, however, there was little change, and the local people felt betrayed.
"Our heart is broken because in 2014 we voted for Jack, hoping he will fulfill our hope of restoring justice," Yo says.
In fact, two months after the October Unusual Injurgation, Jokovi Panya survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and filled with birth glamour in the streets of Enaratoli, when two Indonesian soldiers fell out of the darkness on the motorcycle.
The terrified children told them that they should include bread.
As reported by local pastor J.J.T.T.A., one of the soldiers attacked their tones and, in time, returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were angry with the children and were imitating their vineyards.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Emma, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, a government building of the electoral commission was under attack, and the next day the situation was tense.
About a thousand populace men, women, and children were gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre in order to require justice.
They brought along the ritual lashes and performed the wine, the dance of the populace of my soul: they ran around and pictured the bird’s drink.
Some protestors began throwing stones at the police and military base.
When the situation was resolved, soldiers on the inside radio were ordered: “If the crowd is more than three times against them, shoot them”, he said, as confirmed in the official document seen by the correspondents of the TIME magazine but not published in local media.
Fifteen-year-old Jeremis Kayme, head of the Kego region, who was in Enaratoli, felt a sense of danger and called for peace, asking for a ride home.
No one wanted to hear him.
“When I came back, I was in the left of the pool immediately in a fireplace,” he told the magazine, “TIME”, standing on the wing of his bright wooden house.
Some time ago, he doesn't know who shot him, but he says that the bullet flew by the Shereng soldiers.
"There was a long time ago, and the shootings were many," he adds.
In the local village of Alfius Jouva three times fell, as reported by his brother - in - law, who became a Witness of the shooting.
“I ran to him and looked at his body to make sure that he was,” said the magazine TIME, “Johanes, which, like many Indonesians, is used by only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
General Yotge Mende, the chief police inspector of Papua, told the reporters that his officers had only "protected" their base because it had been attacked.
“We must protect when people threaten to kill us,” said the representative of the police of Papua New Guinea, Commissioner Podjo Sulistio, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi moved to Japan, where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and tried to address the issue of historical abuses by the authorities in Papua New Guinea.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never come back again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security said that he would establish an impartial organization to end historical violations of human rights.
But it's almost time for answers.
“Most violations have taken place long ago.
Some of them were in the ninth or beginning of the zeros.
The fact is that we certainly want to commit these violations, but there are procedures to go.”
Viranto then withdrew from his speech, speaking with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, and said that he was not planning to set up an organization to review complaints in Papua.
He said, “All will be judged.”
Viranto, whom the United Nations accused of “criminities against humanity” of killing more than 1,000 people during a blood vote on the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been brought to an end, including the incident in Panama.
The families of the victims from Spain met with such statements with a dark disbelief.
“For the past three years, I have been questioned four times, but no changes have been made.”
"I'm steady."
He says years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I fear the soldiers will arrest me, I fear they will shoot me.”
His brother James also expressed the view that the people of Spain are afraid of discussing the event.
He said he was killed by the soldiers after he helped to bury four victims.
He says, “After we have buried our bodies, the soldiers have come to me.”
Shoot didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at the wooden residents in a neighboring Panya District of Deia.
During the interview between the wooden residents and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help bring a man who was unconscious, to the hospital, to the death of one person and 17 others, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Douv, who died while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Deforested forest inhabitants protested at the construction site of the company.
According to the police, the village inhabitants were rocked by officers who responded to the warning attacks.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesia Specialist) has been shot at and killed by a man.
"We were in this panic, we're afraid of rewards," reported the TIME magazine, a twenty-nine-year-old Doming Badi, who lives on the hospital floor and saw how the wounded were brought in quickly.
"I've been home for two days."
Parliament of Deiai required that the officers in charge of the incident be called to respond and the mobile police bridge was withdrawn from the region.
Panya has always been a painful place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development results in a lack of land, land, land, and dams scattered across the territory of the Black Central Highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Freedom of the Pope (OPM), a rebel army that claimed to protect the rights of the popes because of the punitive attacks and kidnappings of the Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders are from Spain, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Cgoya.
As a response in the past few years, thousands of people in Spain have been arrested and subjected to the threat of “protection of national independence”.
Some didn't come back.
Among the people of Papua Pania, it is considered “a sacred, forgotten place”.
Poverty is increasing infatuation.
A small portion of the rice sold in Enartol is too expensive for locals.
The bread is not available at exactly the same level.
People here develop everything they eat: mainly notes, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can be harvested in four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the furniture for the family, and the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten club notes are made up of 10,000 Indonesian rubies (75 cents).
In time, economic inequalities between indigenous papayas and new migrants increased, which came to large numbers after the introduction of new aircraft to Nabire Airport.
A number of existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and decent migrants.
Pappas often have money or skills to manage their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the woods... because there's no work or money here," says John Gobay, president of the Panya National Council.
The isolation of Papua has been different from the views of the rest of the world.
Furthermore, restrictions on the work of international SMEs remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil London were deported from Papua to “insufficient agreement with the relevant organizations” despite the fact that they had issued a number of videos.
According to Félemy China, the Deputy Director of Asia ' s Human Rights Watch, promises made during the Jokovi pre-election campaign to remove restrictions on the work of SMEs in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“For now, foreign journalists trying to report from the Middle East Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua, are facing new dangers: visa rejection and blacklisting,” he said.
The lack of attention by the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited to immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Panya strike.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Aramanta Nasir, withdrew from the group's statement to journalists in Jakarta that “in Indonesia the democratic system is still functioning and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
Local residents want more foreign Governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch human rights ambassador, Kissam Van Barar, visited Jaapura on 4 May, the local people violated the silence, saying, “We want freedom”, as the source who also attended the meeting said, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections were held in 2019, but the popes said they were almost revoicing for Jack.
"Jokovi is a man whose good intentions are good, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting in Panya," says Gobay, president of the Family Council.
He wants Jokov to know that the people of Panya, in addition to living under the threat of the Alpine army, are in poverty, and education and health are in dire condition.
Gobay says that the people of Panya, like other popes, consider their voice to be given to Jack for the length he has to pay.
He will say, “They do not need any reward, and they only want justice.”
Despite threats and threats, the families of the shooting victims in Panama have carried out the last symbol of non-conformity: they have buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly against the police and the military.
Knowing that justice is probably never out of control, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," says Jacobus, not a proud head.
"What else did we do?"
The second time fire covers the Dubian skyrocket, Fakel.
The fire covered one of the world’s tallest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, urging hundreds of people to leave the seventy-seven-five - foot - high construction project at 337 m high.
It's a second fire on a high building called Fakel in two years.
The building had been evacuated, human victims had not been reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire signal and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and we needed about ten minutes to get down from the fifteenth floor,” reported a weather agency named George.
According to the civil defence administration in Dubai, fire forces set fire at about 4:00 a.m. on local time (00:00 a.m. on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on the provision of asylum to victims.
The event could bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in the extraterrestrial buildings around the world.
In the post-fire investigation by the Fakela Administration, it was found that in 2015 the most serious damage was the external panels used for cooking and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that it was believed that the insulation system and the placard panels of Grrenfell-Tauir buildings in London could speed up the spread of what occurred there in June, resulting in the death of about 80 people.
The growth of the Ida-Viruma tourist stream was minimal in June
According to data received by the representative of the port of Rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of the hotels in the North-East were used in a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, with 125 persons or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period.
The number of local tourists has decreased, while foreigners have grown.
Yes, the foreign traffic increased by 7.3% (554 people) in June to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The largest number of Russian tourists in the region was 8.9 per cent or 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, all guests of Ida-Viruma stayed on the night of 3885 from the RF.
Andrey Malahov gave understanding to the worshipers who were in his care.
Andrey Malahov appointed his worshipers in Instagram, who were in his custody with the First Channel.
So far, he has never commented on the audience, but today he has posted a fragment of the article on "Knowledge" on August 1.
Photo by Malaov signed the "boss molocosos".
The article on how to prevent a worker from getting " up" and focus on his situation.
If you remember the numerous reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived vendor, who was about to translate "Just speak," it becomes clear that he was so clearly pointing out, it says "KP".
As it has been reported, the telephony of Andrey Malahov is currently on leave and has not signed a petition for release from the First Channel.
The situation can be resolved in the near future.
Five soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when the car was fired.
At least five soldiers were killed when they were attacked in the Afghan province of Gilmand.
According to the police, an abandoned car was set up at night with a military blockade on the Girishk train.
It's a 20-year-old.
On Friday morning, a new CP took place in Greece.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Daver went to the video with his camera on the clock.
Daver and researcher Greg Scomal (Gree Scomal) were impressed by the video of the shark that hit his ex-Camera GoPro.
Rolik was posted on Facebook by the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, a staff member from Scomal.
The incident occurred on 2 August in the Cape Town Coast of the North-East United States, explains Portal Necn.
A man was trying to take an aqueduct to a camera he was holding on a special deck.
I noticed a man, a animal over six feet [3 m] tall.
Acula agreed to cut the camera and did not try to attack a scientist.
Cobal explained that the witch had come in such a way to determine whether a ghetto was found.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the crop.
He also noted that such behavior of an animal had been shown to scientists in the newspaper.
There was a known cause of mass trauma in the Ural Military Center
In the training centre in Poland, where mass shooting took place, a working group of senior military officers arrived to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this scourge have already been known.
According to the map of the Mash appearing on the "VContakte" page, the Ural War Contractors No. 31612 were badly injured because of an unexplained bleeding.
It all began with the fact that a number of Sayan's orders had been shown to ignore the officer's order to make the most of it.
Military officers from the sixth century were set up on the side of the officer.
She's been holding her first hand.
For a period of 140 young men, blood and cancer broke out in the cassava, and the glass was thrown out.
More than a dozen people were injured in the mass drama.
In the CWO, information on taxation has been examined.
The study showed that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States were carrying prohibited items in the aircraft.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of passengers were safely or accidentally placed on board the aircraft through items prohibited by the U.S. Transport Safety Administration, including at least 6 per cent of which were planted in the aircraft, without having any of the prohibited knives or other heavy items.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they had discovered that they had accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charterers, Inc. and more than 1,000 people showed that young passengers were more inclined to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to escape from what was prohibited by ABB, 19.7 per cent were million compared to less than 15 per cent of X-ray members.
In spite of their knowledge, ABB staff usually carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent acknowledged that they had been subjected to special examinations, while 2.2 per cent of women respondents and 3.7 per cent of men admitted that they had been informed of the banned drugs in the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them had been subjected to a traffic test in airports and how well they had done so.
We expect that most of all - consciously or unconsciously - will be opposed by those flying most.
As the company points out, the ABB rules are quite complex and complicated.
People often don’t know exactly what liquids they can carry.
So it's not surprising that most of what the ABB takes are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ABB could be considered prohibited from transporting the book.
Immortality is permitted on internal routes, but not on international routes.
The Head of EPA Priutt refuses to abandon the implementation of Obama ' s emission reduction rules
The next day after the request of the 15 States head of the Environment Agency, he withdrew his decision to suspend the implementation of the regulations adopted by Obama aimed at reducing emissions of pollutants from the air and lead to capacity education.
The Bureau explained its decision that its agency is now more than in previous administrations than it is in need of environmental regulators in individual states.
He did not mention an appeal against his previous position in the Federal Appeals Court.
The stage was extended around 1 October, for which States should ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Priutt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to give his Office more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies in local decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
The prefect of the Treaty, which before being appointed by the President-in-Office, was the Attorney-General of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opponent of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Priyt had repeatedly blocked or revoked the introduction of rules against the chemical or oil industry.
The unexpected change in the course in the middle is the actual legal expression of the Piotto course to return to the previous rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the head of EPA exceeded its authority by attempting to suspend the implementation of the regulations adopted by Obama by oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the flow of metals.
In a statement issued in the middle of the evening, the Preuitt suggested that, with a significant change in the course of the ozone standards, he had simply fulfilled the EPA's obligation to cooperate with the States in the integrated process of implementing the new standards.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often not possible to put into the deadlines, after which there was no search by the group of activists and others and discussion of the deadlines during the settlement of the case,” said Priutt, who gave more time to the investigation against EPA at his previous post.
"We do not believe in the regulation through the judicial process, and we are seriously concerned about the deadlines set.
We are also seriously concerned with our constitution and with the authority it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that the Prijutt may, at some point, again use its “authorities for delay and other data by law” to ensure that the rules “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information”.
The Republicans in the Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone-depleting rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The New York Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of States seeking against EPA this week, said that the group was planning to continue legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course - after our demands - is an important victory in the fight against health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, directly affected by the power of their city," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delever, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the Colombia area.
The ground-level ozone emerges when normal pollutants from cars, power stations, oil processing plants and chemicals and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
The result can cause serious breathing problems to those who are sensitive to these people, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in the course of the Priutt.
"It's hard to imagine how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the man who was ordered to protect the air we're going to breathe," said Laurie Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to oppose the ideologies campaign of the Trampa administration and to protect those who are airborne and their particular interests.”
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the Russian Federation ' s easy-to-duty
The Conference of the International Association of LEG-Affiliates (IAAF) voted in favour of the extension of the Russian Federation of light-emitting athletics (VFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Council for the Rehabilitation of the WFLA, which issued a report on Monday, recommending the withdrawal of force.
A total of 166 people voted against - 21 were handed over by the TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that the FFA has made significant progress in meeting the conditions established by the Rehabilitation Council, but these conditions have not yet been fully implemented.
As a result of the disqualification of VFLA at the World Championship in London, Russian light aircraft were forced to speak under the neutral flag.
There were 19 people who were allowed to join the IAAF.
WFLA has been in the process of continuing disability by IAAF in 2015.
The report was then published by the independent expert of the World Antidipping Agency (WADA) Dica Panda, which dealt with numerous violations of the WADA regulation by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more details of the latest report of the IAAF Council, read in the material "E" "IAAF extended sanctions against VFLA".
Double-declining depreciation [d]
In the 3rd round of the Russian Federation Foundation, the new HMIC PFL team launched a march against the Caluga FC.
More than 10 days ago, opponents played each other in the Russian cube, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Hickey" didn't give up on anything, but a secondary weakness in the outcome of the match led to a test of hunger and physics.
After a recent defeat by the Catholic Count 0:3 many earlier prophesied the easy victory of the governors.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, the newcomers had to consider and act as a defence but as a force.
In the 1st tier, there was more coercion, and there was the advantage of having a sword.
Alexei Sirotin, who several times experienced serious injuries and his actions, gave assurance to his partners.
Unfortunately, Hhimika's attack did not take the effort and drive to put Kalugi in a trap and kill the first hole on the way out.
After the break, the game started to run at the meetings.
The New Yorkers were more active in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team have been an error in defence, which has allowed Catholics to create a number of extreme moments.
In 10 minutes before the end of the Hhimik meeting, he had taken over the territorial advantage and had several dangerous attacks.
But the Catholic experience played their role -- they were more grammatically and coldly done, they had their own moment to take over.
After the dangerous attack, Mike moved the sword to the corner, which gave him the farm field without opposition.
The author became Yuri Dubrovin.
At the reporting meeting, Mike showed a bad game, but he suffered a great deal.
Our team is waiting for another departure, 11 August, at 19 hours in Moscow, at the "Torpedo" station named Edward Streltz, to meet with the favorite FC Center "Araat", composed of Roman Pavlučenko, Marat Izmilalov, Igorj Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support Mike!
The location and time of the meeting of the New Yorkers was 18.30 p.m. and the Magnolia store (East, D.2., Corp.

According to the published telephone communications, the Tranquil forced Mexico to pay the wall at the border
The Washington Post newspaper issued a signature of telephone talks between the President of the United States of America Donald Tramp and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone interview with President Enrique Pjey Néto Tramp, the Mexican President made an effort to stop him from publicly saying that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The President of the United States hated him for saying that he was publicly speaking against the wall and, according to the press, said to him: “You cannot say this press.”
The tram started its pre-election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and claimed that Mexico would be forced to pay for the project.
His first telephony with the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Ternbull, was also exposed to a hot cloud.
Tramp told Ternbull that the agreement to which the United States should adopt refugees sent to Australia was “a joke”, “a joke” and “a lie”, and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by Obama, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the movement of refugees into the United States.
The tramp finished the conversation, said Ternbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation all day”.
The lost bodies in Abkhazia sent a plane from Sochi to Peterburg
Aeroplane, owned by the Russian airline Rossia, on board by the bodies of the lost Russians in Abkhazia, issued a flight at 20:15 in Moscow from Sochi to St. Petersburg.
At the end of the follow-up point, the officers of the ritual agency, as well as the representatives of Mary City, told the journalists of the Deputy Minister for Kurts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
Former representatives of the ICHR stated that all the costs associated with the delivery of the body back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Suhum intends to pay for families who have lost compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Abkhazia, the leadership of Abkhazia was willing to pay to relatives who lost their lives as a result of the explosions of tourists and living in the Republic, but relatives had only made the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, about 16:20 at the time of Moscow, two explosions occurred in the village of Primor-Guutes, in the capacity of the Ministry of Defence of the Ministry of Defence, after detonating large-scale snares and other munitions.
As a result, the site was refurbished, which caused uncontrollable explosions of various modifications.
As a result, two citizens of Russia, Elena Polakova, were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were in the air near the orphanage.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazia, were brought to the medical institutions of the Republic with various injuries.
At present, there are seven people in the station, the remaining ones.
The study of the Russian influence on American elections has taken a great deal of interest
The Russian Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller gathered a large jury in Washington to study Russia's influence on the election of the president of the United States in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to ask witnesses under oath.
The collected material will examine the prosecutor and decide whether they are sufficient to make charges.
The call of a large jury gave Muller additional powers to collect evidence.
One of these investigations will be the details of the meeting of the son, then the president of Donald Trampa with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnik.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Mueller promised himself.
They're already studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Tramp had expanded the status of his lawyers.
Tramp told him earlier that he had made a compromise at the candidate's headquarters at the Hillary Clinton Dempart, but no disseminating documents had been presented, and the decision was finalized.
At the beginning of August, a number of media reported that a youth ' s statement on a meeting with Veselnick was literally condemned by the Trappa elders.
In the White House, he explained that the president did not say anything but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Vice-Mercy Pens were detained at work
The Under-Secretary-General of the Department of Pensions, Irina Shirchina, was detained for 48 hours on the orders of the Follow-up Committee at its place of work, reported RIA News.
Official communications from the law enforcement authorities on this matter have not yet been made, but the CSC Press Service has assured that they will soon follow.
There's no comment on what's happened in the Mary Pens.
Irina Shirsina is one of the five Deputy Heads of the Office of the Pensions.

Before that, she had been working for a long time with the Head of the Gosjillströhteinspection of the Pensions Area.
Irina Shirchin is raising three minor children, noting that she has become a mother a year ago, has declined a decree and has returned to work.
Of course, there's no space in Mexico, no rocket carriers.
However, the space agency was established in 2010 and the desire to develop its own space programme.
And the establishment of Yuria Gagarina's bus station is a day of respect for the first man in space.
Unlike the memoryists of the Soviet period, which are held in some countries, the memory of Gagarin, on the other hand, “walks around the earth”.
In 2012, the monument was established at the former NASA headquarters in Houston, U.S.A.
A memorial in the Royal Observatory was established in London at the time of the 50th anniversary of the first flight to space.
There is a memorial in Gagarin, Germany, in the town of Erfut, where our cosmonaut arrived in 1963.
A memorial in Carlovakia, Czech Republic, was avoided by public protests in 1992 and was transferred from the city centre to the local airport.
In 70 C.E., the memory of Jurius Gagarinsu appeared in Riga.
That's what the name and the name of the first Latvian spacecraft sounds like, and it looks like it's been done for 70 years.
Morse Ford murder: Activists lose Linca's courts on stage to call for justice
In 1948, Ford Mercuri moved to the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia, and he set off to the small bridge of Morse Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver walked over to the bridge, a group of white men with Russians built her way.
The head - man of the middle years in the middle of the suit in the dark of the floor, he slammed his sword and looked through the wind glass.
Sitting inside was scared.
"We need this nigga, Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Inflamed with rage, a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was held on 22 July, is just a stage.
But when Roger's hat was painted, almost all the viewers and the truth were inspired.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to resurface that night when two black couple Roger and Doroti Malko and George and My Murray Dorsey were bound in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's clear that no one has been arrested for all these years - although we see them with us; although we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the decision.
"It's five in our history and it's a stone in our souls."
71-year-old Brooks, former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights for the rest of his life.
To him, the spectacle is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the Monroes that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want to end, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he says.
"We can't go to relief and reconciliation until we get justice."
The Coroner covers a simple body of one of the victims of the murder at Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to UNFF material received by En-Bi-Si-News, over 50 people in Monro and neighboring towns were suspected of participating in lynching.
But no one was charged with this.
Although the suspected decades remained free, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well known for two related reasons: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's decision first allowed black citizens to vote on the precedents to be held this summer.
About the same time, according to the FBI, blacksmith Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester, a white farmer, apparently because of women.
Brooks says that, according to the audience in town, Hester slept with his wife, Malcolm Doroti, and that the child she was supposed to be born was not male.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a big white farmer, paid $600 a loan to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and went to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob surrounded the car.
"It is clear that he organized and ordered Harrison's murders," the conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also evident that there was a treaty between state and city law enforcement authorities that not only participated in the killings but also destroyed the streets and hid the witnesses' identity."
Brooks calls it a step.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
"They have all been killed in order to send a signal to the city. If you are going to vote, it will be the same."
Almost ten years ago, Cassandra Green is conducting an annual exhibition that re-produces this ringing at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Its mirror is observed, it captures the viewer and increases the profound racism that many would like to see no more in America.
It's hard to see and it's harder to turn, but Green thinks it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Linca's courts because they show us our own kindness," she says.
"But I can't build relationships with you if you don't listen to me or don't listen to what I've been through."
The performance of this year began in June, and on the first day of the year, almost 30 actors, the remaining white, the others, gathered in the room and listened to a five-year review of the song.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He's been playing the role of the main member of the clan for a few years, but he says it's not that easy.
"I think I fell asleep because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
In the seat of the actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are replaying their role.
Spectator begins with Malcolm, who declared that Hester was sleeping with his wife Dorota, screaming and interpreting him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Call Rascona in answer.
The attack is broken.
At the same time, all (at least all black actors) are exposed to noise.
Green laughs at everyone.
"What's that?" Ask Ascona.
He's worried and upset.
Do I play again?
"No," says Green with a smile.
"I just don't think the whites said 'nog' at the time."
"Yes," said one of the black executives.
"You've got to bear a hard r."
The same is true of the energy in the room: the atmosphere is changed by the feeling of friendship.
Everything has to be done right, not only for the songs, but also for the memory of the four killed people.
The stage begins.
This time, when Racona says the word "n," it gets clear and straight.
No one smiles.
Spectacular is ending very badly and fast.
Crys, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a dark black dress stands above the bodies of actors and sings a cruel song by Billy Hollywood "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred yards of it, half-eyed viewers pull out the eyes of the stream and the floor.
Nearly equal to the number of blacks and whites among the viewers.
A couple came from Italy, New York, to see the presentation; many live around.
They had been suffering for almost eight hours from George’s intense spirit until Brooks led them into the bedrooms of Malcolm and Dorsey.
To this day, killings have remained only history, but now that they stand at the same place where people are separated, their appearance seems to be breathing in the air.
When the last note of the song is closed, Green invites people to come closer and look at the body.
Children are put to death by their heads, given to the beauty of the blood, and their bodies are not moving, and they touch something else.
"They're not dead now," they're fighting a little boy, saying to remind themselves of that.
In a few minutes, Green is grateful to the viewers, and the team is done.
Actors excavate the wires and pull out the wires.
Bradshaw is wearing Marbo, a man in his suit who played the main football player.
Nick Rascona has two other actors and one of them, crying, falling in promise: the emotional load of the mirror has finally fallen on him.
"All right," one of the women squeaks.
"We know your heart is good.
You have been responsible for this."
The viewers are going to work together with the actors later.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta were excited to discuss the show with a black couple they had just met.
Denise Dapplinski, working hard to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to hear these terrible, bitter words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think divorces are happening until then," she adds, "just now it's called the police shooting."
In the second corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, was a general focus.
He says he's already begun planning the next year's presentation.
"A stay is comforting to us because it not only describes the fear that we have survived but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't get out of this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are turned back to it."
Criminal Court of Naval for the "Agitiation Substantial" violations
The Moscist Court of Moscow had sentenced Alecés Naval to 300 thousand rubles for violations of the organization's order.
The opposition was recognized as guilty of an administrative offence under paragraph 8 of paragraph 20.2 of the COP RF “Reconstruction of a mining organization”.
Former Judge Hzhir Musakaev, Judge of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Moscow, concluded an administrative case with regard to Leonida Volkova, head of the opposition headquarters of Alexei Naval, who was responsible for the same article as the Naval.
Volkov was recognized as guilty and sentenced to 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of the booklet on the “Agitiation Sub-tabote” held by the Naval Party in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agitators following the subsidized party, the police thought that the organizers of the event intended to conceal the true essence of public action (which required prior permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazuev sought to stop administrative production due to the lack of criminality and indicated that the police had allowed certain delays in the preparation of the protocol.
In fact, Volkova's "Agitiation subcontractor" had not been detained, but he received a report that required him to appear in the police office to discuss the event carried out during his active participation.
The same information was received by the National and another opponent, Nicolai Laskin.
In Mordonia, arrested by a newly shot youth and three wedding guests
The Mordovian court arrested a local resident who had shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.

Pilson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to return to business
On Friday, the British Educational Group of Pierson announced that it would reduce the number of additional 3,000 jobs and reduce the number of temporary dividends by 72 per cent due to the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at combating the problems faced by their businesses.
These cuts, which, according to the head of John Fellon's company, are mainly due at the end of 2018 and early 2019, result in an addition of up to 4,000 jobs reduced by previous restructuring.
Pilson stated that it was planned to cut costs of another 300 million dollars (394 million dollars) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to get back to business, which had resulted in a rapid transition to digital learning methods.

Attack on a horse in Kabul: soldier Nato died as a result of a murder
According to the information received from the official sources, a terrorist killed a soldier in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killed one NATO soldier and wounded several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were injured, as reported in NATO communication.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the city area of Karabakh.
This was the last of Afghanistan's casualties in this month of bloodshed: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the graves in Gerat.
On Monday, a terrorist killer killed two people at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, an explosion that occurred on Thursday night occurred when a joint battle with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of “a perpetuating man of a self-explosive explosive device”.
It is reported that all the wounded are in a stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern to NATO forces located in the Netherlands.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan had a minimum of 1662 civilian casualties and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, a deadly terrorist attack on the car caused at least 30 deaths in the Shia region in Kabul.
Taliban said they had made the attack.
As a result of a powerful explosion in the city centre on 31 May, more than 150 people were killed — the most serious of the human victims in the country since the United States-led troops were removed from the authorities in 2001.
Violence accentuates an urgent situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of United States military forces providing military and police assistance in the country.
Correspondents have also said that the crackdowns in Kabul over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its line of conduct, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, following judicial investigations, rejects the decision to refuse the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The U.S. Environment Agency has declined the decision to suspend the adoption of the Obama Age Act, which states should limit air pollution emissions from the day after 15 States have been brought before the agency due to this step.
In the middle of the evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “zone-2015” measures, stressing that this step shows the willingness of the agencies to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and the appeal to them,” said Scott Priyt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, the Priutt announced the intention of the Environment Agency to suspend the ozone measurement, where existing air pollution measures in various parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet the stricter standards of air pollution by one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Colombia, requested that the intention was illegal.
The Administration of the President of Donald Trampa is trying to reverse the broad range of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barako Obama in a broader programme aimed at economic growth, according to the Trampa.
But action in this area has led to the opposition from democracies and environmental organizations concerned with the possible impact of large public health emissions.
The Environment Agency’s website notes that the use of ozone-depleting air “can weaken the function of light and enhance respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
European Business Association against New Anti-Terrorism Sanctions
The Association of European Business expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against the IMF.
In the opinion of the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so it cannot be limited to the principles of free trade.
The European business combines more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to draw up a new line of conduct that would allow business to separate from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and agreement.

Members of the pride of Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Parties and Valerius Lesnikov believe that car drivers are interfering with people to play and breathe in this place.
In their view, monitoring of drivers would help to make this territory more peaceful and safe.

It is found that capital repairs and well-being are seen.
The sports and children's pitches from the car are not taxable.
As the Pskov Information Agency notes, the PPC and its partners are patrolled by central security personnel at night.
The number of vehicles traveling is reduced, but the whole movement is not stopped.

Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, “remove copies, verify them and use them during the follow-up.”
The Head of State added that it was not possible to " create conditions that prevent business from continuing to pay taxes immediately".

The Mothers of Garcia and Vasili Lomačenko meet first, to discuss the possibility of a decisive unit
Vasili Lomačenko and Mike García, who, in general, will be moving constantly to conduct the most impressive boxing match up to 147 pounds in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They occupied some rooms in the official spaces of the ESPN in Los Angeles, while Garcia, an unvictable champion in the light of the World Boxer Council, did not pass the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Bourgeois Organization champion in the second half of the season.
After the unique victory of Garcia over the former world champion in four heavyweight categories by Irene Bronner on the showtime channel on Saturday, both boxers are among five better boxers outside the heavy class.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Have a good time."
Lomačenko protects his passport in a match with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock on ESPN.
When the boxers looked at the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Climas noted that the potential decisive struggle between them would be the first time.
"I used to be in a semi-trailer," said Garcia.
"I've been in the category for Bronner [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big anymore.
I'm smaller than 140.
I want to go down to the pool.
And he needs to get up to a half-pound [up to 135 pounds], and then we're building a unit.
That's what patients want.
Let's get them that."
Lomačenko agreed.
"The box needs this unit."
Climas asked whether the fight should be transmitted through the PPV service as part of the strategy he held that Lomachenko had spent his debate in the 135th season this year in order to mark the next summer meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 nocouts), which was also interested in meeting with the winner of the strike between Horhe Linares and Luke Campbell after their battle for the World's champion in the light of the Forum on 23 September.
“He may be on PPV, because all the patients have asked for it”, said Garcia, expressing his readiness later to meet the channel that offers better financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will call for such interest.
How are they then going to be prepared?
Garcia said that he considered Lomačenko to be a “consumer boxer” and may have visited his sub-item.
But Lomačenko didn't start to greet Garcia immediately and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three Rivers of Riversaida looks like "a little gentle, sorry, Mikey... you've been asking for a kiss."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the power of the strike, and then the box.
They both said that they felt that the pressure would rise to their own unity.
“This battle must be held.
No other fight is so much of an interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomačenko said: "I've eaten a man's bunker, and he's here, Mike.
That will be a great struggle."
On several central streets of Moscow, the movement is suspended on exits
In these exits, on 5 and 6 August, the movement is limited to the capital of the Tower Street from the Nastasin River to the Triumfal Square, as well as the movement to the 1st Street of the Tower of Tam.

The streets will be closed from Monday, 5 August, to 5 hours tomorrow, 7 August, due to their well-being.
There will also be a closed movement on the territory of the border of Moscow.
There's still a "Serve" park.
Putin ordered the Genocorator to check on Baikal.

In addition, the Russian leader requested action if the facts of violations were identified.
New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest findings of asylum-seekers in Sweden, which have introduced a new health assessment method, show that more than 80 per cent of respondents have been assessed as persons under the age of 18 but are not yet convinced of the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Medicines Agency (Rätttsmedicalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to assess the age in the asylum process more accurately, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migratingsverket) criticized that it could not determine the age of some refugees who claimed to be underage.
Migrationsverket was currently conducting 6,880 trial cases, and the judiciary has now published 2,481 trials for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of tested was estimated as 18 years old or older, and in 25 other cases, the court agency assessed that the tested “probably 18 years old or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that the person was “probably less than 18”.
The tests are carried out only when the age of man raises doubts.
According to John Goranson of the Judicial Medicine Agency, results correspond to the results of the past month.
"We don't see a big difference between statistics over the past month, the number of corresponding ones," he said to the portal "The Local".
The high proportion of cases judged as 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and reported that in 442 cases “more recently, 18 years or more of age tested”.
However, considering 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that, in 243 cases, it was publicly stated that 18 were to be fulfilled this year.
The method of medical evaluation of the age to render the ringing of the teeth of the teeth of wisdom and tomography of the bones and to provide them with analysis to dentists and X-rayologists has also prompted criticism in some institutions.
One of the sceptics is an endocrinologist from the Royal Institute of Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess people's biological maturity to determine whether they have gone through sex before or after normal.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think that it should be used in the measurement methods that are currently being used.
This is how biological age is defined very wrong.
If we can't define it with confidence, we don't have to do what we can," said the Metro newspaper.
However, Goranssen, from the judiciary, said in terms of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of taking a child as an adult is misleading.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18 in that case about 10 per cent".
I wonder if you're going to vote for the president.
During a working trip to Burundi, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider whether to vote on the position of President of Russia in 2018, he was transferred to Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the province of Chemoshki Buritt.
During the video conference on the elimination of fire in Burundi and the region of Irkutsk, the colleague turned to Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimmirovic, we have your request: when the next presidential elections are to be held, we all ask you to return to this post."
"Horosh, I think, thank you," said the president in reply.
On 28 July, the president of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, commented on a number of media reports that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin was led by the director of the administration of President RF Anton Wayne.
Peskov called these notions "no based, hypothetical arguments".
"There's no headquarters at all, until there's a far-fetched building, to a remote electoral campaign," Peskov said.
"It's not on the agenda yet," Peskov said.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party of Jim Jastys, announced on Thursday during the minutes with the participation of President Trampa, who is moving to another party.
"You like it or you don't, but the democracies have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justin.
"Today I speak to you with many prayers and thoughts... today I speak to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you, remaining a democratic Governor."
Mitting's been exposed to affluence.
“That is why I will change my registration to the Republican tomorrow,” added Justin.
"As a coach, I would tell you, time to play the other one."
Earlier, Trump had promised that an important statement would be made on the move in West Virginia.
Tramp won in West Virginia with a transfer of 42 per cent, and Justin did not support the candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justin, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he belongs to a coal mine in five states, as he inherited a coal business from his father.
It is estimated at $159 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “the transition of Governor Justin to another party is another attack on the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere than it is to make our country big again”.
“In view of all 15 Governors and control over the smallest number of state legislative bodies in history, the statement by Governor Jastisa is just another refusal from the party that has no leaders above the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unified communication”, said CBS News, representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna Mcdeniel.
Cot-tagelose by the call Mr. Krasavčick found a house thanks to the cassettes
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a car that was named Mr. Crassaczyk more than 14 pounds [14 kg] after he became famous on the Internet.
That's what Mashable reports about.
At the end of June, a photo was published on Facebook by the Pitomian account, asking to find his company, because "it was obviously someone who was a little older."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal’s sea could become a new memo.
The audience received more than 3.2 thousand copies and 15 thousand comments.
In the ten comments, ten expressed the desire to welcome Mr. Krasavčica.
As a result, he was given in the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take his leave.
In an interview on the radio, the American WNCN said she had already had a similar experience: she took a house about 10 pounds [10 kg] wide, and now she has a little more than five.
In July, users of Reddit drew attention to Australia’s cat with unusual long legs.

Who commended Russia ' s “extremely” apology for the doping scandal
The international expert on easy-to-flyer Sebastian Kou praised on Thursday that he called for sincere apologies from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was now an inappropriate time to allow the country to participate again in sports events.
The Russian Federation's representative, Dmitry Slakhtin, reported at the International Association of LEG-Affidavits, which had been launched by the World's Light-Attic Championship, that his country's withdrawal from sports tournaments was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “to all sportsmen who stole gold and silver medals at the funerals.”
Despite its comments, the Congress of the International Association of LEG-Affiliations voted to maintain the derogation imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-dumping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of the use of doping financed by the State.
“I have found that today's response, today's report has been very honest,” said the rapporteurs of the International Association of LEG.
“The whole Council and the Congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation itself would recognize that it had spent very good time and is now doing everything possible to worry about the reorganization of the Federation.”
Who said that he was also “profound”, that Russia agreed with the criteria for his restoration.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission, which now does not allow Russia to regain its rights,” Kou said.
“For the next few months, we must do everything we can to cope with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean sportsmen from the underprivileged system.”
Nineteen Russian sportsmen, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of LEG, will participate under the neutral flag in the World's Light Attraction campaign, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of LEGs, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements would still be required for the restoration of Russia.
As he reported to the reporters in London after a report made to the International Association of LEGs, the drug testing is not yet carried out enough, but the foreign trainers are still doing their work in peace.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a hostage
The arrested journalist Vassili Muravisky of Ukraine (SBI) sent an arrest warrant for two months, transmitted to the SBI.
The Internet Officer of the Zheimaira Journal is suspicious of the public change by placing its publications on Russian websites and by referring to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities' measures against the journalist, considering it a "warwar policy" against the media.
Two years after the crisis of migration in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship Commander Borsina entered the territorial waters of Libya to stop the flow of illegal migrants along with the WMS.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian parliament in the middle.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, in addition, does not control most of the territory of the country.
The opposition cabinet and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
The commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, issued his sub-command against the Italian ships.
In Rome, they also claimed that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel into the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Jentiloni and the heads of the recognized European Libyan Cabinet of Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of an illegal maritime migration mission after the number of illegal immigrants from Libya was announced in July: 95 thousand people from the beginning of the year.
Governments have stated that the resources for the reception of migrants have been exhausted.
The massive damage occurred in Skype
The Global Concern for the Skype Service has now been established in a number of countries of the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to file complaints to programme developers.
In Microsoft, experts have already worked actively to address the problems faced by European and North American citizens, clarifying the "News" RIA.
We remember that in June of this year, Skype's work was also damaged.
For some time, users could not receive and send messages.
Two leaders from Ukraine's collection of easy-to-fly athletes withdrew from participation in the DM
Olga Land Lake and Olise Povh, who specialize in escape for short distances, are excluded from Ukraine's collection of peace-2017 champions in London.
This is reported on the Federation's website for the Light Attraction of the country (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by an executive organization in connection with the encouragement of the International Association of LEG-Afflicted Federateds (IAAF) for lactic acids.
As part of the Ukrainian delegation, the trainer, Sergei Basenko, was also excluded.
As Sportarena reports, IAAF suspects sportsmen using doping.
Povh - the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, the 2010 European Championship in the 4 to 100 metres, the Earth - the 2012 European Presidency winner in the 4 to 400 metres.
The World Championship for Light Attraction in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football affect the passage of Nemira to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited traffic by European football clubs do not interfere with the international record of the German transfer from Barcelona to Paris, France.
Whatever the consequences may be, for the Paris St. Germany, the lead authority of the European football control body, who has the authority to ban the participation of troops in the prestigious "Liga Championships" tournament.
In 2011 the EAFRD's financial regulation, which was introduced by the EAFRD, should finally show that the Nemera transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free a Brazilian from the contract, and Nemer will receive a complaint that will reach $10 million a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Nemara's move to France.
The PSPs can be precisely spread to attract Nemara and add it to the galaxy of other stars if it takes into account the funding of the team from the rich energy of the family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of toys, but they have to balance them with the legal sources of income in order to achieve the cost-effectiveness of their football business.
“FFP” introduced Michel Platani after he was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
The former French footballist believed that the clubs in large debt in his quest for success would actually have been robbed and threatened by a breakdown if the banks or owners had stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debt of clubs, and instead moved to track their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model, which Roman Abramovic used in Chelsea in 2003, was to buy clubs with good potential and then make a serious effort to improve the team and create a world brand, became a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period covering 2018, clubs can lose 30 million euros.
And despite the fact that the planes withdrew from the presidential position in 2015, UEFA's successor, Alexander Cheferin, is still firmly committed to curbing excessive costs.
“Of course, the FFP is alive, and we will, as we move ahead, break the rules”, said a week ago by the Assassheyted Press Agency, Andrea Traverso, FFP-controlled UEFA.
Although “NEC” and paid for the cost of the Nemara contract at the same time, it may distribute this amount for reporting throughout the duration of its contract.
Nemara signed a five-year contract so that the transfer value could be shown in the annual accounts as a cost of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSPs, as well as the Abu-Dabi Manchester City, were applied to severe sanctions.
The PSC was set at 60 million euros (after which the rate was 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros and was scheduled to limit the composition of its team in the Better Championships during the period 2014-1015 by 21 games instead of normal 25.
WEFA monitors clubs that may try to re-enter its financial inspections by disseminating their income from companies related to the owners of the club.
Although the camaraderie company could provide a “PSG” but if the amount of funding had been higher than the standard market estimates, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered legal income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for the JSP was disbursed by the Qatar Tourism Office.
It was reported that the part of Nemara ' s employment in the JP could be paid by the organizational committee of the 2022 World Championship in Qatar.
However, the IPJ and Qatar-2022 deny that Nemer will become a champion of the world, and such manoeuvres could easily be identified by the inspectors of WEFA.
The previous sanctions imposed on the JIU mean that the EAFRD will be more closely monitored by any attempt to enforce the rules.
As reported in the four persons who were aware of the situation, WEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with the PSC on the Nemara transfer.
They met with the Associated Press agency under anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the provisions of the JIU.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, the PSC received more than 10 million euros in sales of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
“PJ” expects that the arrival of Nemara will be a pleasant ground for sponsorships, the sale of attributes and football with the team's logo.
The club is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of the new game.
No doubt, as one of the best footballists, the Spanish League has tried to mix the Nemira transfer, claiming that the PSC would violate the financial “fire”.
“This is the obvious case of the financial doping, with the club and the State,” said the Spanish newspaper La Lighi Haveer Tebas, bearing in mind that the final owner of the PSJ is Qatar.
Arsenal trainer Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnet, shares La League's doubts about the State's funding of the club.
“This is all the consequences of long-term participation, and this has completely changed the football team for the last fifteen years,” stated Wenger in Thursday.
"When the club belongs to a country, maybe everything.
It will be very difficult to comply with financial fairs, as the country may have many ways and many reasons to be presented with such a serious game.
The order and place of the oath shall be determined by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear to the integrity of the RFB, the President will determine such amendments as the second reading has been prepared by the Commission of the Lord on legislation and housing.
More than a week ago, MPs were planning to determine directly how to make an oath in the law.
Children up to 18 years of age will be released from forced prostitution, as well as from the drafting text of the amendment to the draft law on “Officiality of the RF” (the Information) which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of entering into the RF citizenship instead of formal signature of documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June during a meeting with Mr. Vecheslav Voldin.
Members expressed this view in the form of an amendment to the second reading in the draft legislation to cancel a decision on the extradition of those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, on public calls for terrorism or its public justification on or on the Internet (page 2, 205.2 of the CFP), as well as on the grounds of aircraft, travel or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (page 4, paragraph 211).
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: by issuing documents on nationality, a person is signed under a promise to comply with Russian legislation, which is on the way to extremism, he violates that promise.
The bill was introduced in April to the Lord by the head of the thinkers of Vladimir Vasilev ("Eunion Russia"), Gennadi Zuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Jirinowski (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Sergey Russia") and the speaker of DG Vecheslav Volodin.
The MPs adopted it on 19 May in their first reading.
Last week, the GD Committee on Housing and Legislation approved the text of the draft bill as second reading, but it has now been recast.
It now says that the procedure for making an oath will be set up by the President of the RFB.
The former parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Civility of the RFR, which indicated that the ceremony should be held in a tidal position in front of the State Serb and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the IMF.
However, the text of the draft legislation did not understand where such an event should take place - a list of places where the RF Herb may be located, governed by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of the governing bodies of the entities, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, this could be the SAGs.
The production of stolen goods that wish to obtain the IF nationality will be done after the officials have verified their documents.
However, the Russian passport will be obtained only after making an oath, followed by the written text.
A week ago, the project mentioned that the oath should precede the signature of the order.
The updated text states that Russia will be 18 years old, not 14 years old.
The rule on which the oath is to be released will be invalid or limited, as well as those who cannot read, read or sign the oath itself.
In addition, the President of the RFF has the right to release from this procedure and other persons,
The updated bill also stipulates a special procedure for adopting Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered Russian-speaking.
They should be officially dismissed from Ukrainian citizenship by providing the relevant declaration to the competent authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A written copy of the statement should be transmitted to Russian officials.
The rejection of a "skin" nationality, as at the present time, will not be necessary if it is provided by an international treaty or if it is not possible to "in the power of non-cause-dependent people".
The relevant amendment to the Act was proposed by a group of MPs, including the first vice-president of GD Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalya Poklonskaya, Paul Kraschennikov and Airtar Farrahov (the "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a job from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, very many people were waiting for their decision to decide on the nationality of the RFI, explaining the pressure of the head of the think-on committee on the construction and legislation of Paul Krascheninnik (ER).
In addition, the text explained that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners would not be extended to those who had literally declined from "other" nationality and had given prior passports to Russia's MDGs, but had not ceased to be regarded as a citizen of another country for no reason.
Foreigners are now prohibited from taking office in the municipal service, being admitted to work on the premises and in the organization related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with a dual nationality or type of residence in another country cannot become a Member of the Lord or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017 and that the required acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia is going down in the "America Airport" and "Tourašta Detectives"
The present destruction of history is reminiscent of the glorious days of the 80s; the era of the border in the 90s (e.g. when Masters David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made a series of "States" for MTV); and the same thing is about 2001, before her stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Rad, moved to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is at the same time the rise and fall of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But like French, it's called anachronism.
"The first day of camp" was a great surprise, not just because of the Absurdist Hoor (including the original story of the garden bank, which was called H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubled: middle-aged actors play sexually worried children who have only reached adulthood; this makes it impossible to get back into a corner.
Ten years later, where adults have already played, they have less deep emotional roots, and their parity is more unsympathetic and include riffs from the sticker movies of the 90s type of "Rucky Fly."
In one episode of staff, Apple Powerbook is available, four-year-old Role Cokes, and the 'Court of Other Things 'from 1991'.
A lot of mixed ways are the same.
The well-being Cup (Schoolter), now the writer, has not yet gained a relationship with Katie (Margarit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't grown up with a girl yet.
And there is still a mindless and low-sighted debate involving Ronald Reygan (also Shoulter) who now supports George Bush-ager (the tested parade in the performance of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of French is to leave it.
It's especially fun to see a young Radda who sings a song by Matt Dillon from the "One" character, whose ex-boyfriend Andy looks like an old man now.
The success of this French would be possible by accident in the spirit of the Recursive Series Seven Up, until it comes to its logical conclusion: "The Great American Summer: Twenty Years Down", where at last, all the companies would go to the movies to the top of the movie "The Great American Summer".
"Tourist detective" at the Amazon is referring to another type of disaster: the memories of the cold war from the Americas, the explosive blonds, or even the Blessa with its anticipating forms of East and West.
The video created by Brian Gatewood and Alesandro Tanakak, director of Riss Thomas, portrays the Romanian police drama in the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles - the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Persik-young and Cornelio Ulitch, and their dialogues were conducted by the English Chenning Tatum (the same executive provider) and Joseph Gordon-Levett.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual shocks (police take time to scan the masks, as the Americans can see the football.)
The command of the so-called voice for the frame - including Jenny Sleet, Nick Offferman, Mahershal Ali and Chloja Sevinii - allows interest in playing "Ogadya voice".
But the "Tourist detective" is so held up by the unexplained propaganda drama -- there's even a cell phone in Ronald Reygan's mask, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are slowed down, and funny is not very, very often.
For example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, there are two full-time people in the village who are throwing a bunch of hamburgers.
This image, which is viewed by the communists, says that Western culture is capable of making a cure.
The inspired Roman authors of the film are no longer wrong: we do so even with our recent history and with them.
The call fund for Superkobok Russia on football between "Spartacom" and "Locmotive" is estimated to amount to 30 million rubs.
The President of the Russian Football Premier (RFPL) Sergei Pradekin was informed of this at the press conference.
According to the FIFG chapter, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that the tickets to the match are almost gone at this point.
Matt "Spartacus"-- "Locmotiv" will go on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartacus is an active RF champion and Locomotive is the owner of Cuba.
Two young vampires cleaned the furniture roof for 200 thousand rubles
One day, a 37-year-old woman who owned a furniture company was sent to the police.
The man said that he had stolen expensive tools from the roof, which had caused serious damage to his production.
The winning enemy has become tools of nearly 200 thousand rubles: two oars, perforator, hydraulics, ledge.
The guards began to search for criminals and soon entered the Blagwistan region of Baskorotostan, 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Republic of Moldova, the communications were found in the territory of the undertaking, breached the entrance door and produced the instruments.
Immediately after that, the guy sold the first hit car.
They have already been subjected to a crime case, and law enforcement officers have been able to return to the rightful owner only part of the stolen instruments.
Mr. Medvedev commented on the relationship between the IMF and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hizer Nauert in response to the words of Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev on the relationship between two States.
The former head of the Russian Government stated that, with the adoption of new anti-terrorism sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and announced a full-value trade war with the IMF.
Commenting on these words, Nauert recognized that Russian-American relations are "low-level", but noted that it was necessary to seek "a space for interaction".
"Look at the peace in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says RIA News diplomat.
The representative of the Foreign Policy Office therefore refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister's statement that sanctions are equivalent to the trade war.
The draft legislation on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the United States President Donald Tramp signed in the short term.
He recognized that the document had failed and was in conflict with the American Constitution.
Dior "increased" roses from the amethysts and the quartz
The French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - was filled with the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
There were five new bicycles and three pairs of bicycles on the docks.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan is composed of two new rings and columns from the amateurs, the pink box and the brilliant ones performed in the gliptic technique (hand cut on stone) and the respect and attention of the 70-year-olds.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoria de Castellan was inspired by the roses that grew in his place in Granville, the model of Christian Dior, and the Paris gardens of Bagate and Pre-Catelan.
The trauma found offenders who had damaged relations with Russia
The President of the United States of America, Donald Tramp, made a series of criticisms to the members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank the Congress, these people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
The arrest of Donald Tramp signed a new sanctions law against Russia, Iran and the CDR.
They are, in particular, affected by Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently issued a statement by the President, which indicated that the law would not allow the United States to conclude useful transactions and to be closer to the RFF, China and North Korea.
Belarus's entrepreneur rejected the purchase of the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
The operator from Belarus, Victor Prokopenia, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary unit.
Its business decision explained to the NCB the intention of "to focus on other of our planned investments and projects on which we are working".
According to Mr. Prokopenia, this step will become “more time-consuming” despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia became the main claimant for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application in July of the NorvikBank Consortium, Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guzerieva.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after Peter Poroschenko, president of the country, imposed sanctions on their daughter structures in March.
One of these financial organizations, other than the U.S. and the Bank of Foreign Affairs, has become Sberbank.
Novak called the reason for the blackout in Kramue
In the Ministry of Energy, the IMF called the reason for the crash in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation of what happened.
According to him, the islands were left without electricity because of the road transport incident in the territory of Krasnodar.
As a result of the falling goods in the DTP, the power transmission line was excluded from Cuban and related networks.
The electricity supply concerns of major Korean cities were fixed last week.
Specialists have removed the scars for a few hours.
It was originally reported that the cause of the blockade could be an anomaly.
The Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will later declare that the percentage rates will not be changed after the weak economic growth and weakening inflation have made it possible to hear about possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unabated and left interest rates unchanged in the growing pressure on family income.
The members of the Bank's Monetary and Credit Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of maintaining a level of 0.25 per cent, while this month the smaller number of members of the Committee were increasing, as weak economic growth weakened the support for improvement.
In its quarterly report on bank inflation, it limited its forecast to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that family income pressure would continue, while it is still expected that inflation would rise by approximately 3 per cent.
However, the Bank warned that increased rates in the next few years would be needed to control the inflation caused by brexit inflation, and said that employment costs would likely be higher than expected on the financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted in favour of withdrawing from the part of the public development package of the economy launched last year as a result of the crisis.
Since February, the Bank has been closing its emergency financing plan for which it has provided cash banks, although it has now reported that it is still in the framework of the plan to provide another $15 billion, up to 115 billion.
In the Bank's decision-making protocol, it stated: “The growth of gross domestic product (WFP) is expected to be slow in the near future, while the pressure on real income continues to affect consumption”.
On the issue, he reiterated that, in order to stop inflation, there would be a need for “some financial policy” in the “a few more” sizes than the markets expected.
At this point, the market is forecast to increase first in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “study” and “limited”.
The Bank's projections for growth in this and the following year are lower than the projections made in May, which amounted to 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank left its constant forecast to 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, Sterling fell in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The fund paid 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after recent adverse growth rates were reduced by an increase in expectations; the GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, the overall judgment remains at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it has begun to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The last report of the inflation bank provided little cause for the happiness of households, where high inflation and a significant increase in wages were achieved: the bank said that pressure would be harder to reduce.
The Bank added that financial policy “cannot prevent” work in the next few years, but expects payments to return to the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared towards growth as a result of growing demand for British goods resulting from a low rate of money, which compensates for some of the lower consumption costs.
The decision was taken over a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25 per cent in last August after the shocking results of the Euro-EU dropout referendum.
The Bank's evaluations will require four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank had made its last decision on rates, it had developed a noise around the expected increase in rates, as inflation had increased the pressure on and so on the domestic economy: three experts in the Committee requested higher rates up to 0.5 per cent in July.
In the past month inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although it was expected that the fall would be reimbursed in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than the planned 2 per cent was the result of a low rate of pay.
Andrew Montleyk, director of the company “Koreco’s mortgage brokers”, said: “If you take into account the recent drop in interest rates, the mortgage market will again become more competitive, as creditors require business opportunities and count on the good end of the year.
The market is particularly favourable for those who are close to the end of their existing treaties, such as the refinancing of loans, often with the absence of the Commission, and with a low rate, becoming popular as never before.”
The State Health Service has signed a debate on HIV-related preparations for 10,000 persons
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolving” drug for HIV prevention after the battle in the High Court on the financing of a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England stated that the pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PREP), which was adopted before sex, has reduced the risk of injury to those in the risk group at an average of 86 per cent, which will now be provided for health services during the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after the appeal court had upheld the Supreme Court's decision last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay the PREP despite her statement that it had to finance local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “the turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, the Venerological Dispensers in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will begin to register, and more will join the programme in October.
Pre-deposit prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV preparations taken to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As studies have shown, PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among risk groups.
When the PEP is adopted, the human body has sufficient amounts of certain preparations to prevent HIV infection.
Such preparations can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to treatment include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose HIV partners are positive and do not receive successful treatment.
The dissidents will choose appropriate participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transmitters and persons whose partners are unknown to be detained by HIV status of antiretroviral therapy.
People living and enrolled in the general practice in England can also apply for a potential participation in a nearby Venezuelan dyspanese participating in the programme.
The programme will amount to 10 million dollars, and the National Health Service of England signed a product-supply contract this week after the international procurement contract.
The study is designed to assess all possible PREPs by collecting clinical data on who is the target auditor of the preparation, on its identity and on its application to a large extent.
“This is an important innovation that needs to be complemented and strengthened by broader and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another challenge for more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Debor Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said: "This is a turning point in combating HIV.
The PEP, if it is intended in a grammatically for people in need and at risk, is able to change the situation of HIV epidemics in England.
Since September, people in the HIV risk group, thanks to this study conducted in England by the National Health Service, will have access to a new open-ended means that a person can control without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We give you the good news of God's mercy."
Jan Green, President of the Terence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now first of all, we need to be concerned that the test is rapidly going on throughout the country, and that none of the HIV risk groups have been forgotten.
Now, when we are provided with the PEP experimental equipment, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Minister for People's Health Sharon Hodgeson said: "We very welcome the start of the PEP test, it has been very late for months and a break by the Government."
The data show how revolutionary this can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending this annual infection.
This test will draw us closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the PRSP.
It is now important that the test be as quickly developed throughout the country as possible to protect those who are at risk of HIV and to further move us towards the end of the spread of HIV in society.
The World Conference of Fathers adopted a resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth meeting of the World Congress of Tatar (WCT) adopted a resolution which noted the importance of maintaining the position of the President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positively recommended form of the organization of the highest government in the Republic and expressing national interests of all the Tatar people”.
In addition, the meeting stressed the importance of the treaty on the limitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in ethnic, socio-economic and social and political development in Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
The Treaty between Moscow and Kazakhstan has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, Ambassador Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to maintain the title of the head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only entity that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only position known as the “President”.
There were difficulties in obtaining international driving rights in Russia
GIBDD's units are testing the lack of international driving licences (ITUs).
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait a few weeks for this problem to happen to those who wish to go to the back of the border on their own car or take it there for a while.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licences remains controversial.
The IRU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as its information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Movement, but in the countries ratifying the Vienna Convention, Russian law is recognized as such.
However, the case depends on specific police or procrastinations: some require VAT and some are sufficiently national rights.
In order to ensure that international rights are still obtained, however, it should be taken into account that the authorities do not have the right to recognize national rights or the VAT in non-ratified countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, and Indonesia).
The problem with whites is now being monitored practically in all GIBDD units, reports Commersant, conducting research in a number of regions.
Yes, in Moscow, the UGIBDD units are simply not issued, and the banks are no longer four months old.
It can be written on the guest site, but it has already grown there before mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain "for technical reasons" without giving details, in the Samar area, it is fair to say that there are no branches, the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Muslims have already faced the problem, and reports of such reports are often presented as follows:
Irina Burmistrova: "Remember why there is no access to international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the GIBDD offices end up in the blanks.
Elena Podcolzina, "Ask the people who know it!"
International rights must be obtained very quickly.
In Moscow a long time ago, talons are not even released at the site (a button is, but the talon cannot be given).
It's kind of a guest's portal that shows that in Spb's free time.
Did anyone try to get in another town?
Does it work?
As explained in the IMF, the requirements for international driving licences were changed, so the Gosavton Inspection Unit provided new branches.
This may also be related to a deficit, which, in fact, is unclear what changes have been made, which has not been reported earlier.
Banks purchases the Road Safety Special Assignment Centre (CSNBD) RDF and then puts them in the GIBD unit.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the OO "Goznak": nearly 200 thousand MVB branches have been made in 2014-2015, 15 thousand branches have been purchased in 2016, 90 thousand have been purchased in 2017, but the last contract has been concluded on 18 July with the OO " First Printed House" for the production of 70,000.
There is a version that the CSC has just failed to make time for a tender, which is why and is the cause of a deficit.
In addition, there are other versions of the lack of blanks: because of the crisis, many people have become self-sustained, not in Europe, but in more developing Asian countries -- China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are taken there until the end is unclear, so people are frightened and terrified, so there is an urgent demand for international "steps".
It has recently been known that professional leaders should be examined to confirm their qualifications.
The proposal was made by Mintrans.
The international driving licence (IMV) of the new model is valid from 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Peterenko, stated that he would not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, 4 August, he said in an interview with the Ombudsman portal.
None of the respected international companies will even put a bottle or cake there, as it is at risk of losing their business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on the Crime.
"It is, in my deep conviction, that there is no prospect of this project," said Petroenko.
He added that Russia considered it impossible to carry out a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia is not able to properly build even less large objects.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, all the stadiums have already been destroyed.
"That is why I believe that the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so invisible to join the project," the officer noted.
On 31 July, the construction was completed by the construction of the bridge of the Kremlin.
At the corner of the church, a large collection of the railway ship of the Kremian Bridge was completed: it was closed at a height of 45 metres from the foundation of the building.
"At the same time, engineers prepared a railway ship for the installation on the paints," they reported to the information centre of the project.
In April, the head of Mintrans Maxim Sokolov informed President Vladimira Putin of Russia that the construction of the project was in violation of the schedule.
The Kremlin Bridge is united by the Crimean Peninsula and the Red Sea.
In Spain a worker who didn't work for 10 years was killed
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of Spanish officer Carles Resio have been?
The permanent decline grew for 10 years.
On the other hand, Mr. Resio was still released.
But not his direct chief.
That's not the only thing that's happening in the world.
Neighbors seem to have been accustomed to all kinds of "slaves of the people" for a long time.
Nevertheless, officials are always able to impress those whose demands are not being met.
This time, the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, a staff member of the Valencia Carles Resio's archive has been forced to stay for ten years.
At that time, he received a regular apology.
It's worth 50,000 euros a year.
And this is Mr. Resio's "frequency times" is over.
He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that the abuser came to the office every morning at 07:00 to mark the electronic system.
And here he went home.
Once again he appeared at work at 16:00 to notice again what he was going through.
And that's 10 years.
It has also been noted that the fireman has devoted all the time to the firefighting of comics at home.
Now the Members of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking of how to punish and punish Mr. Resio, who could not know how to " actively work" in his workplace.
The Courts propose to protect the Presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HR) on the Order of Vladimir Putin developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The COP proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Tribunal and to make their election.
The Court of Appeals and Cassation wishes to introduce special areas that will not be bound by the administrative and territorial action in the FIF.
The President ' s proposals should also be submitted by the Supreme Court.
The COP has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the PPC on 3 January 2017 by Vladimir Putin, who was appointed by the President after a meeting with the members of the Council.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 was discussed, including individual cases of judicial leave, as well as issues of public control at the detention of civilians (see "E" of 9 December).
The work of the COP has resulted in 25 proposals relating to the issue of the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Tribunal to improve the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate at the trial has successfully passed the contest and received support from the judicial community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the PSC, must submit him to appointment without the right to refuse the law.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases between judges.
This can be done by experts, a specially written computer program.
The COP also considers that the President would not have the right to “determine the results of the qualification assessment of the judge, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to take decisions on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the Presidents of the Tribunals themselves" and to "delegate their powers for a relatively short period of compulsory rotation".
All the Presidents of the Tribunal (from Republican to regional) are now appointed for six years as President of the Supreme Court of the RF.
In order to compensate judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the COP proposes to reorganise appeals and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial action in the IMF.
The CHP said that “there is a need to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized, not at the level of the judicial authorities in the FFR, but in the judicial areas”.
Experts are taking on the basis of the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judgment areas” that do not correspond to the administrative department in the FF, but that guarantee this greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty using the “telephone” right.
World judges have been invited to strengthen the people's seats to consider some of the “Citizens and administrative cases” with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of employment, the protection of dignity and dignity, the deprivation of rights of leadership, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained the member of the PSC, Judge of the Constitutional Court, in the absence of Tamara Mortacov.
She also recalled that the presidential order was not only related to the PSC but also to the Supreme Court (WS), which had not yet made its proposals.
There is still time for the mandate to be carried out by the WC (between executives - Genocorator and Human Rights Officers in the FF).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the FF, the President of the U.S. President Veceslav Lebedev is due until 1 September.
Living a high life: Politicians and quick designers have transformed this little room in Earls Court into a room
Joan Lee, an ex-banker who was involved in the real estate repair, moved from the local house in Nitsbridge to the apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the sympathic typical house in Queen Anna's style, and the new design says that Joan didn't pick up his things and didn't move again.
"I used to live with my former in Nitsbridge in a much larger area," says Joan.
"I wanted something to compare with my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high rates here.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price on the same day."
Since the first district review, a total reconstruction has been carried out in 1000 square feet.
It was a room with one of the most complex bedrooms - to fall into the bedroom, it had to pass through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add space to keep the stuff and the furniture to enjoy the maximum benefit from the gift of the floor.
"I wanted a high flow, a large window, a lot of worlds.
Such was my demands," she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill of the Duke & Shed Architectural and Design Studies to use the 12.5 feet high and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be a pleasure for Joan to live.
The flow was not high enough to build two spaces above each other, so the structural task was to create a place where it could be fully grown.
Erfan came to think creatively to deal with the bridge.
“Work with permanent structures is very difficult”, he explains.
“They had to have a place so that they would be on top of each other, and they didn’t have to get hurt.
It was not just to build a simple platform but to replace the structures so that they would be at the right height and allow for use of the upper and lower spaces.”
This decision allowed Erfan to build two fully-fledged rooms over one another in a remote area — and much more interesting.
With the winding of a winding wind from Retrouvius, a glass window is opened on a guest’s side below.
The silver furniture with the gold department, silver accents and the winding lamps of Serge Muya are designed for the style of the project.
The use of the mirror plays a role in adding lightness, space and light.
The short corridor is covered with a mirror so that it can be heard longer.
In the kitchen, the side panel looks like a window in the other room.
The entrances of the circus are used to keep Joan's entire crew safe.
In order to create a sense of the greener space, the beauty of the guest can be a kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like a garage.
“An engineering experience has been developed here,” Erfan will tell about an armed wooden-walled protective door.
“It is a challenge, so when you have opened the door to it, it is very easy.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received additional 16 square meters, additional bedrooms and improved planning.
“At the end of the day, the field of sex is what you will sell; that is what you will be sold.”
“I strongly believe that an agent for trafficking in non-movable property will come and produce accounts on the basis of the sex field”.
Here they were able to increase the area of sex by using quality materials that contribute to the more exploding area.
"Materials are what we're trying to do, so they help create emotional ties with the house," says Erfan.
“No one likes electricity in walls.
It's important, but it doesn't affect the strength of our hearts."
This serves as evidence that because of the well-designed and enlarged metering of the apartment, it can become something that is normal to turn into something boring.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a Committee on Public Cultural Policy.
The relevant regulation is published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policies, clarify the objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the Commission is appointed by the Vice-President of the REF Government.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev adopted a plan for the implementation of the public cultural policy strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the single cultural area and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the development of conditions for cultural development in the country.
Inflation in G20 has been reduced to an eight-year minimum
The growth of consumer prices in G20 countries has been reduced to minimum values in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent lower than in October 2009 when the price index reached 1.7 per cent.
In the past, Rostatt reported a reduction in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1 per cent.
In this way, the press has established the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation rate in Russia, according to Minfina, is 4.1 per cent.
The mini-economics, however, believe that the target value has already been achieved - by the version of this department, the figure is 4 per cent.
Warning Path from the illegal extraction of buccal tea
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on environmental development in the natural buccal territory, warned against illegal forest destruction.
In the course of the activities of the Minister for Natural Resources Sergei Donsk, he noted that a bill had already been prepared.
It allows the forest to be cut off in the time of the fires, and the Government plans to adopt it by now.
In turn, the President said that the project should be followed in order to "not all the duties" in the extraction process.
Donkey noted that this bill had been controlled by the ICP and the supervisory authorities.
MMI: WSW fighters are secretly engaged with Dombass personnel
A regular telephone connection has been established on the line of armed resistance in Donbass.
The combatants of the opposing parties are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and the public do not know about this at home.
The U.S. soldiers and the Donobs commanders have set up hundreds of cell phones to hide from their high command.
On 4 August, the “Strana.ua” reported with reference to the military operations in Donbass.
According to the release, the commanders of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and are regularly contacted by their telephones.
The community is not at all home: the commanders are trying to achieve some "actual arrangements".
The outcome of such talks is partly due to a transition to a certain front.
Journalists were informed of the cases when the official received greetings on the day of his birth from his formal enemy.
The U.S. and the DDR and LNR troops are in the vicinity of the barrier line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a war operation against Donbass.
The MDG has blocked UN SB's allegations of attacks on the RF mission
The Russian Foreign Office is compensated by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who block United Nations statements in press condemning the terrorist attacks of the RFP Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian MD.
The Bureau recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August was the third time in a month when a minor bombing was committed by the terrorist groups, Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham (formerly Jabhat An-Nusra, prohibited in RF) and File Ar-Rahman.
Taking into account that the international community is united in the capacity of "Nurse" as a terrorist organization and UN resolutions call for the intervention of this structure, the MDR noted that "it would only be understood that the Nusre tracts should meet with universal and decisive condemnation and that there should be no doubt in assessing the challenges of diplomatic missions."
However, as emphasised in the Diplomatic Division, "the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine, already in the United Nations Security Council for the third time in the month of the adoption of a standard short draft of the Security Council's declaration to press the Russian diplomatic presence in the Syrian capital, perhaps, with a variety of objections, covering evidence of the lack of the necessary information."
The refusal to show diplomatic solidarity with us remains with those delegations.
“More than anything else, the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to be subjected to new provocations and tragedies, gives them a sense of impunity,” they stated in the IMD and added that “it would not have been possible for those conflicts to create a belief that someone in the Security Council would agree with them.”
Vladimir Putin made a statement on the limitation of the number of in-depth business checks
President Vladimir Putin of Russia, during an investment project meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of in-depth inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned ones, as well as said the need to limit the time of ten-day inspections.
“Integral checks are normally carried out without the appropriate consent of the prosecutor; only 2-3 per cent are in agreement with the prosecutor, and the rest are on their own”, said the TASS President.
Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prevent investigators from exaggerating servers and hard disks on businesses.
The President also believes that business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will make a certain position in dealing with cases relating to business activities or violations of the law in the field of business”, the head of the State said.
As "E" reported, the number of other inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing due to the actions of the moratorium on the carrying out of the planned checks.
In May, a study was conducted with the Russian President, Boris Titova, which revealed that there was actually an unplanned verification site (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent in 2016), radio (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent) and civilian statements (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More details of business checks in the "E" "To small business" material came from the other side.
Brothers fight for the empire of real estate worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in Victorian empires in trade in real estate, worth more than $500 million, 40 years after their Italian predecessors founded the dynasty.
The former Director of the Cartoon Football Club and Colin de Lutois, who lives in the Turkish court through three doors from his younger brother, Paula, who filed an appeal to the Supreme Court for the division of power and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but there is still a serious dispute about divorce conditions in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anna, her brother, they have owned 87 items worth more than half a billion dollars since their family bought the Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
The family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was put into motion, and the list of family authorities of De Lewis includes today's official buildings, the facilities in Brunswick and Surrento, the Golden Lake and Mount Buller and the shopping centers in the mountains.
According to the agreement with the late father, Colin, whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Louis family, has approximately two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, Colina's property was 316 million, while Paula was 176 million.
The property and money section became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives it, in my view, the best part of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday after several failed attempts to make peace, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, from which Colin, in Paul's view, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but he accuses Paul of mishandling certain objects.
In the evidence provided by the Colin at the beginning of the process, he said that he was hoping for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me think the family is the highest priority," he wrote.
The court costs are rising as a low price: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are reported; both parties have attracted the best known lawyers, including the Royal Lawyer of God Mayers, and the best strikers.
Ms. De Lutois and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; in the late 1950s they managed milk bars and restaurants, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of Jens.
Colin says he ran Westco when he was "in the last class of schools, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) then."
Anna De Lutois says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their power to their children without conflict.
"Lodge told me often that he didn't want the brothers to be in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lewis company; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, Luke, and Mark were “unsatisfied by the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL Club and, as published in 2015 by Eddie McGira, the best-selling star.
"Ferfax Media" was connected on Friday with Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He answered only Colin, a text message that stated that since the case had not yet been considered in court, "I have the truth to say something."
"I am very sorry that my brother Paul decided to seek me and prosecute our family," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see how we fought with Paul in court," he said, adding that "there is still hope for the resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, this hope, we see, spread.
"The decision on our case will soon be delivered by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trampa apparator is planning to limit the arrival of information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have suffered disappointment.
Maybe John F. Kelly's gonna do it.
In that case, he'll be the first one.
“political” reports that the new head of the White House apparition is planning to limit the flow of information coming to President Trampu, including news from the media, with the hope of keeping the head in a more peaceful position.
That's what reporter Josh Douzi reports.
"At the meeting held by the new head of the White House apartment, John F. Kelly, with its first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trupe, who was hoping to decide: a bad channel of access to information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that information should be passed through him in a folder or by briefings, because the president would be better able to make decisions if he was to receive the correct information.
Diagnosis Kelly is perfectly faithful, but others have already suffered a failure by attempting to calm Trampa, following his arrival.
President Trampa's relationship with the television was a few decades ago - and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
"When Tripp, as a candidate, rebuffed the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received a fair light in publications that could be won," said Sam Nanberg, former electoral adviser in February.
Tara Palmer then wrote in Politico that “six former members of the electoral headquarters said to maintain the habit of writing on Twitter, should be followed by a constant stream of praise in the coming personal information.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trampa's habit of writing on Twitter was sometimes "under control", just funny.
Maybe these electoral staff members know something we don't know, for example, that if they didn't, the Trampa tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Tramp hasn't published.
If his staff had protected him from trouble several times, their efforts would not have been in vain.
But nobody was always able to stop the tramp from oil spilling into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into opposing factions, people are constantly trying to promote their agenda by giving the Tranquil material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Politicalo" - as in this history - wrote in May on the duty of the advisers to keep the President informed of any doubt.
Here is one example described by the reporter Shane Goldmaher:
“The current and former staff of Trampa say that the tramp can react very strongly to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks, and will not be satisfied until they find out who is behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone posted an article to the president with GotNews.com, the Internet site of attorney Charles C. Johnson, where the deputy chief of Katy Walsh's apartment accused her of being "regarding a few refugees" in the White House.
It is not important that Johnson has been permanently banned in Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he has not given specific facts or that he has in the past initiated false charges and then refused them.
The trauma read the article and agreed to ask staff about Welsh."
Goldmaher adds that the then head of Reins Pribus and the secretary of Rob Porter's apartment “has tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of the books received by Trump”.
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly tried to do the same.
He may appear to be more effective than Pribus, but Trampa still has an impulsive nature, and its assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly a very difficult task.
Tuman Procurator v. HIV-dissident
The prosecutor challenged the Order of the Kalinian Court of the Tumani, which ended the criminal case against the local resident where the girl was killed by HIV.
As a result, the child died because the mother was a resident of HIV and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to create a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against the inhabitants of Tumani was suspended after 1 p.m. 109 of UNHCR (cause of the death of the homeless) in April - after the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection at 4V.
According to the procurator, the mother itself is HIV infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat the daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," they explained in the Tuman province.
The criminal case took place in the Kalinian District of Tumani, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The father of the lost girl made this request, explaining that “he had forgiven the woman, had no claim to her, she was injured and apologized.”
The Court ' s decision did not agree and appealed, requiring the decision to terminate the case and to send it to a new trial.
The girl died, and it was impossible to cure the crime.
The infected mother, despite the doctor's recommendations, refused to investigate and treat the baby from a dangerous infection," she reported to the prosecutor's press.
In the view of the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise, for example, by other HIV-dissidents.
As told by the Tumena AIDS Centre, about 12 children who are HIV-related are currently not receiving medical assistance because of parental neglect.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of the work of a special group of parents who have categorically refused to treat children from HIV, have changed their mind - allowed diagnosis to be carried out," said the press secretary of the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
She said that it was impossible to affect parents in a legislative way, and as a result not all HIV-infected children could be found - mothers were unable to investigate, hid, and fled from the hospital with children.
How dangerous HIV-dissidents are
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists submitted the results of the first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement in Russia.
Victims of HIV call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and health activists of the NCO call such anti-medical views and are at a serious risk to their distribution.
The hot photo session, which ended with the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek railway station in Hamelnick.
The happy company of young people who were under attack destroyed the bridge on the railways, where the freight trip once stood.
One of his friends had the idea of making an effective cell on the wagon floor, who had reported the Factam in the Hmelnik police sector.
The couple began to climb out of the bridge on the trip, but because of their invisibility, they were hit by an electrotransmitter line.
Fortunately, this has become known to the dissident of the station, which immediately called the emergency.
Before the doctors arrived, the injured was transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized in the Hmelnik County Hospital.
Men were diagnosed with lung cancer at 1-2 levels.
His condition is now assessed as stable.
The caregivers recall that in recent times the growing population has acquired extreme shells on cross-border multi-ethnic bridges, bridges moving through transport.
The police call on people to be generous and not to allow such sexes, especially among children and adults.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Vienna
There could be oceans in ancient Venezuela.
The French scholars expressed such a view.
Experts have created a computer model that has demonstrated the process of learning water on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It has been found that in Venezuela, at the beginning of its history, oceans have grown by 10% more water than they are now on Earth.
Previously, the "Arguments of Weeks" wrote that, according to scientists, ocean 4 billion years ago could have existed on Mars.
In their studies, foreign specialists concluded that the water object was located in the northern half of the Red Planet.
Three people injured as a result of the shooting at the park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured by the shooting, transmitted by Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to the witnesses, several men at the bridge began to cry out for threats.
One of them took the gun and started shooting people.
The outward appearance of criminals could not be considered as if they had closed everything except their eyes.
Another medical assistance was provided after his release.
The third person is minor, and there is no details about his condition.
The Dolores Park hall is a popular place for local residents and tourists.
On 1 July at least 17 people were injured during a night club in the town of Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several more visitors were injured, trying to leave the room.
Louna rock group will present a new album in Barnaule
The Louna rock concert will be held in Barnaule on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album "The Live New World", which became one of the most expected events of the year.
The collection prepares a conceptual show, which will become the brightest in the group's concert history.
The "new world" is the fourth album of the Russian rock group Louna.
His name is related to a famous novelist O. Haxley, "O strange new world."
The new songs do not translate the book, but they speak of a society that lives under the antitypical law, “the blind faith of propaganda and the bound values. ”
Collecting money on a group album helped the audience: over 1200 people were supported on the Planeta.ru project.
Louna released her first album "Sdeley Gromche!" in 2010.
Two years later the musicians presented the "Time X" plastic and wrote the "We - It's Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the Louna group spoke with the Symphony Orchestra at Cross City Hall with the "Peace Song" program.
As part of the group, Lucinie Gevorkyan (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-gitar), Ruben Kazaryan (gitar), Sergei Ponkratev (gitar), Leonid Kinzburg (Barabwan).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club, Pharaoh, on 17 October at 19 a.m.
Price of tickets: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the trained groups at the Russian rock stage.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debate took place in 2009.
The group has won several times in various hit-and-square names.
Cigarettes crossed the bridge and returned to the "Millions Street"
Some of the most complex households in the West Midland are again in conflict with strong cigarettes that have crossed the gates by the municipal authorities of Rome to take over the field around their homes.
Cigarettes parked 20 houses in a field bordering the wealthy Solihalla street, which received a shocking name as a millionaire street.
When they brought the bad ones, the young men, and many of the houses, they returned after they had driven them away in May, and had not mixed them with the blood which had been stolen by the municipal authorities to prevent their entry.
The tactical company found a break in the arms supply and opposed its vehicles to the crossing of parts that were not limited to leaving room for the tropicles.
The dissembled inhabitants attacked the municipality of Solikhal, saying that he had become “a failure to address the problem”.
An anonymous local resident reported: “They came here tonight on Monday, after crossing from Bentley Heat, where they threw rocks in the past.”
The municipality should proceed and cease to act, because it is not able to deal perfectly with the problem.
They were here in May, they passed them, and here they returned.
Last night there was even more cygon, and today, perhaps even more.
“Municipalities in Birmingham know how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial orders to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on Stritsbruk Road, and I do not like that I continue to pay municipal taxes, and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One of the locals who wanted to stay anonymous said, "This is ridiculous. We have only seen what they used to do in the past, and here, please, the attack continues."
And this time they were greater in number, and we were even more astray.’
The representative of the municipality of Solikhalla said: “We know of the illegal camp on the ground above Stritsbruk Road and cooperate with the Solikhal police; we take the necessary legal action to ensure that they can be reached as soon as possible.”
To help us in the collection of witnesses, it is very important that more local residents be informed about any antisocial or criminal conduct on the phone 101.
This allows for a presentation of the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
Kram shares the company of Champagne wines "New World"
The GUP of the Republic of Crimea, "The Law of Champagne Wine " New World", was decided to act, turning into the OAO " The Law of Champagne Wine " New Light", should be directed by the Minister for Property and Land Relations of the Crime of Anna Anuhina.
100 per cent of the company's shares remain in the ownership of Crimea.
The capital of the shareholders of the company will be 595.5 million rubs and will consist of 5,955 million processed shares of a nominal value of 100 rubs each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea stated that if there is no means to modernise the enterprise within the next three years, it would pose a threat to the halt of the occupation.
The export of major funds to enterprises is around 60 to 70 per cent.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubs, and it is committed to deliver 50 per cent of the income into the budget.
What remains is insufficient to implement the modernization plan.
“Teach money from the owner in trouble, talk about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations,” Prime Minister Cream Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Krima Parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to take stock of it and put it on the market.
The source of the Interfax in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of sales of businesses at $40 million, investments of investors in modernization, still at $30 million.
In 2016, the New World increased the production of wines by 2.8% compared to 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World was planning to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by the King of the Left Golithian as a forum for the release of the wine in his possession of the New World.
The site is located on 11 hectares.
Underground triangular classes were larger than 40
GU WMD personnel in the Netherlands have identified the personalities of 46 civilians who have destroyed 46 graves at the port of Lískov.
A third - grade class was held by criminals.
The first statement that the mollusc plates were damaged was made at the Russian OMWD on 27 June in the Lisko region.
In this regard, 24 persons were sent to the police.
As a result, a criminal case was brought to light under article 244 of the FIFG “Finishing, harming or desecrating the place of storage”.
As a result, the police established suspects, two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing how the memory fell, and that led them to acts of holiganism.
Proprietary activities have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy has increased its tone of reference to the NPOs that rescue migrants.
Italy warned NGOs, which were owned by the Mediterranean rescue courts, that they would not be able to continue their work if they did not comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs are not subject to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say if they can continue their activities," said the interior minister Mario Minniti in the interview with the Turin daily newspaper Stampa.
The warning was issued on the following day after the Italian authorities confiscated the ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspected that its crew actually cooperated with human trafficking and facilitated illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, working all year, rejected comments on the existence of detailed allegations made against it by the Italian Prosecutor Ambrojo Cartezio.
"The survival of human life is and remains a high priority for us, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue area now," said the organization in general.
“We can assess all the allegations now, only after we collect all the information and evaluate the situation.”
The Italian authorities are following the Juventa ship belonging to Jugend Rettet, in October.
Its crew was suspected that the entire rescue fleet had been taken on board the migrants who were sent directly to it by human merchants and had allowed the contractors to go with the ships they could use again.
As at least one such meeting is expected to be located at 1.3 miles from the Libyan border, the content of the charges published in Italian media is hereby confirmed.
The team is suspected of violating the provisions of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in this area rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, primarily, that the Juvent-type court will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in the search and rescue operations agreed to sign the Code: " Save the Children", the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Disseminations " from Spain.
The last Thursday stated that it considered new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided that they did not withdraw any “significant changes or gaps” from its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign were the Nobel Prize for the Peace without Borders (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said that a sharp reduction in the number of migrants arriving in Italy during the last few weeks as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan coastal protection and cooperation with local masters would produce fruit.
"In the last days we started to see the world at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan masters on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to associate with one of the parties to the conflict."
In recent times, the RF authorities have significantly increased their policies on the Libyan side, and with visits to Moscow, the delegation has participated in the anti-Semitting Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on Intrailivial Resolution with the MD RF and Gosdume, Assistant to the head of the Czech Republic, Lev Djugov, told him what goals Moscow would pursue in this region and what it would have to do with it.
The contact group on Libya you're leading is almost unknown.
That's what the contact group in Ukraine knows about it.
And here's the secret stuff.
What are you particularly interested in, and what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the MDR and the State.
Its activities are served by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Bodenov and Adam Delimhanov (deputate Duma from Chechny. - "E").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan mission by Mr. Vecheslavov.
The group was held in Libya by the Russian tanker Mechanik Chebotarev (in September 2015 there were 11 people on board. - "U").
We were wondering how to help the cook.
A contact group of military specialists, representatives of the Lord, was then established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechny Ramzan Kadarov.
And how did you get it?
As I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to take the lead in the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of seafarers from the Chebotareva Mechanica.
We have been able to establish contacts with the representatives of all the major groups opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (where the recognized Government of the United Nations is based on Faiz Sarjam. - "E") and Tobruc (the residence of a parliament that opposes the Government and supports the march of Halifu Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "E".
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister Libya - "E"), we have been able to make a quick deal with the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more effective use of these contacts, to establish a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and games, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to stress in particular that in Libya we do not want to associate with one of the parties to the conflict, we are conducting a dialogue with everyone.
How many people enter the contact group and how many of them are always in Libya?
There are now five persons in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience in the work of powerful structures, including in the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include a group of regional experts, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAN.
No one of our staff is ever in Libya until there is no need.
There are now Russian military advisers in Libya, instructors.
And if so, on which side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All discussions and publications on this matter are not relevant.
But in your contact group, the former soldiers come in...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or they are closed to a particular moment for us, such as Mishurat (where a series of exercises are based on the role played by Libyan leader Muammar Cadafi in 2011 and markedly reinforced in the following years).
We arrived in Egypt in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that there's still Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, analyze the actual military capacity that was responsible for why such obedience was actually the role of Muslims.
In Egypt, we met with all the representatives of the teams that were involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was attacked by the fighters banned in Russia from the Islamic State).
We wanted to see them meet, to verify that they had played a decisive role in the destruction of IG in Libya rather than Halifa Haftar, who had signed those services.
And what conclusion have you come to?
The Islamic State in Libya won not Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar conducted operations on the other front, Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte fought with the government in Tripoli.
And, frankly, we invited people in Russia to do this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came - a visit extended from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was invited to the Federal Council, in Duma, Mide and Rosgvardi.
As we have seen, you are in all the Libyan regions, and you are likely to represent local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to reach agreement on the end of the fire, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, Halifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, once again, as it has happened in the past, will the agreements be broken, war acts will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
The fact that Sarge and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting has been a good sign for us for so long, it has not been possible.
In recent times, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
What about Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe.
We were faced with this situation when they were in Egypt, and the Haftar was on the Russian plane Admiral Kuznez that day.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in the Egyptians in a match.
They said, “You are likely to be very brave today.”
But our task is to show that we not only support Haftar, we are conducting dialogue with all the key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have met.
Does the fact that he has been taught twice in the CSD facilitate understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level?
And, kid, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, it's very relevant.
But what he taught us is, of course, a dialogue with him.
And among others, not only with him.
When we meet with soldiers in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet with the generals who have learned either in Russia or still in the Soviet Union.
And here they're talking more Russian.
And they're going to Russia, to some extent they're testing the fate of her.
Do you think it is likely that a quick withdrawal against Libya of the arms embargo will be lifted?
Are your Libyan allies interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They're interested, of course, but as I said, we don't take any part in this conflict, and we don't want to put one another in harm's way.
We would like everyone to be in the same position.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans continue to hear calls for Russia to facilitate its withdrawal.
The process of drafting the Constitution is now actively being carried out in Libya.
We hope that the parties will make compromise decisions and have an internal consensus.
Then there must be a choice as to what was said at the meeting of Sarajevo and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and none of the parties now have such status), the issue of the withdrawal of the arms embargo may be raised in the United Nations Council.
To raise this issue indiscriminately and dangerously, this will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
One day the media reported that Italy, dealing with the problem of refugees fleeing Libya from the African refugees, feels overwhelmed by the EU's condemnation of EU allies.
Could Moscow help Italian partners in this situation, using their connections with the Libyans?
For example, how realistic is it that the Haftar branches will establish border controls and put an end to the business of immigrants moving immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're working hard on this.
The Italians need support from Russia because Moscow is engaged in dialogue at the same time with Haftar, with Sarajevo and with Egypt and with the South.
In this regard, the tribe of southern Libya plays a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it that the South is going to cut down the flows of migrants on further approaches?
Is that what you're talking about, the bus you're in, you know, that's what the Nigerian migrants are doing back there?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not just.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to help unite the South in the negotiation process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the southern tribes.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of views on this issue between Haftar and Sarajevo.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered a Muslim, a party to the country's entry into the country of Shariah.
How many radical views does he hold?
Would that not be an obstacle to maintaining relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he is, on the other hand, a sponsor of radical Islam.
But the Muslims are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the view that Libya must be an absolutely normal country - a moderately Muslim, open-minded country.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where's his reputation?
It has been established by those countries that are not interested in Russia ' s association with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where there is a legislative, executive and judicial authority.
National oil corporations, national banks and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were concerned that we were not allowed to go there.
And we mixed all the cards and started talking to Tripoli and Tobrusk.
We already know the fruits of this work: Rosneft concluded a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State Oil Company NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with the head of Rosnefti Igor Secin, was directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first download of the Libyan oil company Rosneft.
What will Russia do with her?
I think I'll sell it.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
The contracts concluded at Muammar Caddafi are scheduled to be resigned.
In particular, it concerns past transport agreements (construction of railways), energy (electrication) and a number of others.
What about the Libyans?
Well, they have oil.
Is that the same thing as Iran, about the oil exchange scheme?
I don't know what the plan will be, I don't care about these matters right now.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing a peace job there.
For us to stop bleeding, help the Libyans agree on one another, so that they can establish their order, and Libya has ceased to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
This is the main task for Russia, which is to help the Libyan people and to expel terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that there was no exit from Russia today and other countries of the former SSR.
He said that he had some 50,000 phone calls from the representatives of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya). - "E" and the Russian word does not sound there.
And what of those states?
I don't want to get into this detail.
Then we'll figure it out differently.
How many of the fighter Islamists in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
The Libyans aren't actually there, they're not more than 5%.
The rest are coming.
Could Moscow conduct internal negotiations on the example of Paris?
That's the plan.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, several of the Libyan delegations have already visited Moscow and have declared themselves ready to come to Moscow or Gross.
When can such negotiations take place?
Now it's hard to say.
A number of visits are still to be held, and then I hope there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the charity collected money for a sick boy’s expensive gift
A nine-year-old Sasha Macola boy, in which the CDP, the brain hydrocephalus and the full blind, will be awarded a special escape route on 5 August.
The next item is the Saša Minister of Culture of the Moscow area, Oxana Kosareva, and the director of the Constantin Bobkov Museum.
The trainer's days were collected during the well-being of the marathon "Don't Stop Doing Good", which went to Melikh on July 15th on the Day of the Celebration.
The discovery of a maraphone in the museum was obtained from Sachi, who lives in the village of Manashkino Chekhov, which says, "I don't have any eyes, so I asked my mom to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get in the gift of a runaway road to make my legs strong, and I'd rather learn to walk."
And this is Sachin's dream!
After the dedication of the Conceert-Postscript, a famous piano player, a Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, will perform the favors of popular classical works.
At the time of the well-being of the Maraphone in Melikh, the choir of the Voznesen David Dustin, the master of Ili Drozzhina, students of the Moscow Conservatory named P.I. of the Chinese and Russian Academy of Names of Gnesins, artists of the Melikh Theatre of the Czech Studies.
For visitors, auctions were held, book brands and a favorable sale of sovereign products with a maraphone logo were organized.
The Melikovo Museum Commander has taken the initiative to celebrate the Day of the Celebration on 15 July on the only day of goodness in all museums in Podmoskoja.
A 30-year-old resident of the Olivéska Jitomir area near the local football stadium has several times been shot by adolescents who were there.
According to the suspect, he was shocked by the fact that he was reported to the FACTAM police department in the GITOMIR area.
After that, the man went to a coffee shop nearby.
In the building, there was a conflict in which the man used the device to shoot the giant bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old sufferer has received the necessary medical assistance, and his life is not at risk.
Police and rapid medical assistance have taken place in the scene, but the shooting has been halted.
The guards established his identity and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
A man could not explain his actions.
It has a fire extinguisher that has been sent to an expert.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings were initiated under section 296 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code.
Detention of liberty is serious from 3 to 7 years.
We remember that an attack took place in Kiev, Lukajanka, on the Tatar street on July 28th.
Sentence by Michel Carter on communications that led to the suicide of Conrad Roy
The inhabitants of Massachusetts had been sentenced to two and a half years of detention because it, through text messages and telephone calls, had encouraged the suicide of her cousin Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, now 20 years old, will have to be 15 months behind the deadline and another 5 years of testing.
In June, he was convicted of the indiscriminate murder of Conrad Roy, who ended on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said to the audience on Thursday: "My family killed a fire.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.
She threatened the maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in a purple robe and a cream shirt, listened to the trial, stretched his hands, and let down his eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy by her actions," said the prosecutor's court.
"She stopped his life to improve her life.
She didn't recognize responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show up."
But counsel Carter said that it was a tragic case that she deeply regretted.
However, Judge Laurents Monis said that her “age, age, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions.”
The prosecutor read the mother's statement by Roy Linn Roy, which says: "It hasn't been a day since I wouldn't complain about the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I act - I try to support his sister, despite all the pain that remains with us forever."
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was constantly pursuing the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunts.
"Let go of a man who has always been with me from my very birth is the pain that remains with me until the end of my life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts which would be responsible for the Human Rights Council to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with the symptoms of gas evaporation, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the whole country, when it became known that he had been subjected to the suicide of Carter's mission.
"You may come up with a cross, I don't know a lot of ways," she wrote in a couple of messages sent two weeks before his death when he went away with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and, "You just have to get shot, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Moniss said that Carter wanted to pay attention to Roy's death and prevented her from talking to the press so that she could not get what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers in this regard were divided.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Nox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder in Italy by his British neighborhood and sentenced two years later.
The 30-year-old Nox published his special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Misel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I left Langford as a bird of high flight."
One of the best basketballists in the U.T.A., 33-year-old Kit Langford left UNESCO.
The United States Secretary-General ' s statement was made by President Evgeni Bogachev.
Kitt made this decision on the family situation, told Evgeni Boguchev.
He's got a little kid, a woman who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say "no" and extend the contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played at UNESCO for three seasons and showed a high level in each parent, at 100 per cent.
That's why I let him go as a bird of a high flight.
We thanked him.
We want him to make a success of his family life and a career.
Kit Langford played in the present club for three years, playing the one religion-2015/16 series.
In the 2016/17 season, he received a reward for the most successful game in the Euro-Montenegro season.
He got 21.75 shots in the middle of the match.
The result was the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Europe, who won this prize once more.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese Sanchezing, informs Eurohops.
The United States is expected to conclude a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will become the second in July of the Euro-Montenegro, which is transferred to the Chinese Championship.
Previously in the Chinese CBA, an ex-Central "Pantinoicos" was passed by Jannis Burusis.
The sun-burned tourist from Podmoskoja evacuated by a helicopter in Adigee
The Athenians have today evacuated from the mountainous region of the sub-Muslim tourist, which has received the most powerful sunglasses.
The man went back to the Pisth acceptment, located at a height of 1.6 thousand feet.
The 27-year-old tourist has experienced increased pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were sent to the leader of the group, who told him that the husband’s eggs had arrived.
“Audi” should be modified to 850 000 diesel vehicles
Before the day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would be proposed to update software to more than 350,000 cars.
The President of BMW stated that the company believed that “there are more intelligent ways than leadership restrictions”, with European cities, including Munich, where BMW was available, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of diesel vehicles.
The Dimler said on Thursday that it would modify three million Mersees cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
Not one of the companies called his step by a call.
European car manufacturers actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States in order to facilitate compliance with carbon emissions rules.
However, nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be cancerous and can cause asthma.
The value of the installation of equipment that neutralises diesel exhaust gas is also increased and the competitive price of the vehicle is difficult to maintain.
While the German car manufacturers were under close scrutiny, the Government of Angel Merkel's Chancellor also accused that it was affecting car manufacturers and ignored the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the Folkswagen errors, which prevented the use of the so-called “reaction devices” that could address the number of greenhouse gases expressed during testing, in order to comply with the rules and are excluded under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Folkswagen leaders were convicted of being prosecuted by the rest of the two sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, the former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested as a group of Audi engines.
Former manager, Zacqueo Jovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may appear before a U.S. court.
Earlier this year, Audi was under German criminal investigation with the involvement of Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to deal with European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems for Volkswagen: the oil car manufacturer is the source of an unproportionally large proportion of the Volkswagen income.
A coffee visitor in Australia paid false money
The police received a report from the bank's office on the transfer of funds from the public service, a suspicious buyer named 5,000 rubles.
A study carried out at the Expert-Criminalist Centre showed that it was false.
According to Russia's Astoria, the bank paid one of the coffee visitors who bought the wine.
It is noted that the cassa was not equipped with a set of determinations of the true identity of the buyer.
At present, the police are stationed by persons involved in the production and arrival of a separate CB RF ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the TIR calls on the residents of the Astrahan region to be careful in carrying out financial operations; it is recommended that business operators establish facilities to verify the validity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a planet that can even swim on ice.
In the first study of the stratospheric properties of the giant spacecraft called WASP-121b, astronomers were little surprised by its temperature, which is able to emit iron and other metals.
Specialists have noted that water molecules are so exposed to the light of the stars that they emit an infrafraction.
The Hubble telescope impressed the water molecule on this gas giant: this high temperature allows water to shine in the atmosphere of the planet in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "burning Jupiters" - gas giants, sizes and mass compared to the largest planet of the solar system, but ten times closer to the parent star.
This year, only 1.3 "earth" days are spent on the surface, and its gas supply is nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit [2,500 ° C].
Climate change threatens the labyrinth of Provance.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of the shock and transferable diseases of the population; this has resulted in the constant head pain of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric sixs, an expert at the Institute of Agricultural Research in Provence, says: "Lavanda in Provance is indeed in danger because in recent years this growth has been affected by climate change: a heavy and particularly low rise in rainfall.
This affects the life span of the lavender.
And there are still small cracks that attract the leaves of plants that carry micro-bacterials; they become very much in a very short time."
A lot has been put on the map.
Lavanda is not only attractive to vacationers; lavana oil is very popular in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says: "In place of very long columns with a large number of large colors, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or completely missing.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing epheric oil."
The decisions that are now being considered include improving the distribution of water and the slowdown of soil emissions, as well as depleting the growth of the protective mixture of soil and water and the release of more sustainable droughts.
Ambassador of the University of Winter 2019 met with beautiful schoolchildren
A two-time hockey World Championship, Ambassador Winter University 2019 Alexander Semin met with the beginning hockeys and distributed autographs to patients.
The meeting was held in the summer of 2019 in the theme week on hockey.
Any visitors to the tent could walk on horses on the floor with an artificial bow.
In addition, estaphytes, victors and games were organized with the introduction of the sovereignty product of student games, a breakdown from the federation of the aircraft.
50 students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised children as much as possible to take part in sports stadiums and stressed that the most important part at the initial stage of education is hard work and the desire to engage in hockey.
"It's nice that in Krasnoyarsk there's a flat like the Winter University-2019 hat, where beginners can direct the questions to team coaches," said the champion.
We note that the promotion of student sport and the healthy way of life among the beautiful is helping the Ambassadors of the Winter University of 2019.
Shater University will work for the entire summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter University Press Service.
The Lord commented on Medvedev's words
The official representative of the United States Department of Justice Hizer Nauert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev, said that there was a need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
It said that such areas should be found to “improve bilateral interaction”.
Naut, for example, referred to the Syrian peace agreement for such successful cooperation.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"People around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
Nauart, however, refused to comment on Medvedev's approval for a valuable trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said so, she certainly has the right to speak, but no more on this subject can I say anything," said the representative of the Lord.
Former United States President Donald Tramp signed a draft legislation on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the Government of RDF Medvedev stated that Washington declared Moscow a full-value trade war, putting its hopes in improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the United States sanctions would work for decades.
In addition, he considered the Prime Minister to be the U.S. Stabilization of the "Principal" Trampa.
The missing one was found in the Podmoskove Bibilder on the foreign side of the missing memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov was on his way to Noginginsk on July 25, in very pick-up circumstances: he left the car room to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was badly sought by prominent and local people.
And there was Shamil on a foreign daughter in Rammenski.
He's perfectly grown up in his toilet.
The Danish sportsman couldn't explain what happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember what his name was, but the passport was missing.
To establish the identity of the person has helped declare his absence.
The doctors who came out of the hospital have confirmed the partial loss of memory and brain damage in Hanmeto, reports the newspaper Mash.
I'm sure sportsmen are waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who attacked Shamil were probably already in his apartment, and the keys were stolen from him as well.
The oil revenue in July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the income received by July 2017 has increased to 7.4 billion rubs, reports the Ministry of Finance of the IMF.
The increase, as explained by the Government, has been significantly higher due to a higher exchange rate of US$ to the average value of June used for evaluation, as well as to the actual increase in gas supply and exports of forecasted levels.
“The withdrawal of the federal budget income from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 at +40.2 billion rubs.” - Minfina communication.
Thus, the total amount of foreign currency purchases on the internal currency market for the period from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubs.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency is equivalent to 2.07 billion rubs.
The Bank of Russia will be attracted to the acquisition of foreign currency by Minfin Russia.
Each working day during that period, the CB will conclude the sale of foreign currency in organised markets of the Moscow branch in the course of a trade day.
The foreign currency acquired will be calculated on the Federal Credit Account at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Daily staff in the Riodos newspaper are usually met on the average to discuss plans to highlight the most recent violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or continued war criminals.
But today, victims of their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They said they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed to be more secure: to take the children to the office where they had already broken the branch in 2009 or to leave their home.
Security experts wrote three words on the room floor: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They have asked journalists to name each column - evidence is unnecessary, suspects and internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who suspect that they are in possession of the government or the cartels, a whole list of passengers whose work on the lighting of chaos in Mexico is dangerous.
Violence does not give over, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 times as President Enrico Penna Nitou took his post in December 2012; 589 people were killed after the attacks and threats were under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven countries.
Among the last is their publisher and inspiration, Riodose, the inventor Haveer Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is very serious, although his presence is universally a large picture of Valdes, showing the middle palace, with the title “Justice” on the Riodos building phase; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing shoes on which his girlfriend, face-to-face, or his business boss is wearing.
The seminar lasts less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, their sleeplessness, and their paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders committed each year involving drug and organized crime, journalists rarely appear before the court.
Journalists of Riodos insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, even though they are killed by a storm, even though it is now much more dangerous.
Without information on killers, without justice for talks on safety at meetings, Ibara says.
"It's stupid to spend time on this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodos office in the capital of Culliana.
He was able to pass only a few quarters before his beautiful Toyot the King stopped two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "The Twelve River."
The shooter went into his car and broke her away.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two grown children.
The audience usually spends a lot of time on Kuliwana.
But about Valdes, it's practically quiet.
Since Gusman was arrested and released in the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battles in the country, as opposing factions are fighting to fill the educational vacuum.
We will not say that every day on the streets of Sinaloa kills one or more people, or that the library is filled with two - story drug dealers who are more than the homes of many living people.
We forget for a moment that the state of “peace” is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and routes of drugs leading to the United States.
Despite this and that Waldes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old employer and director of Riodos, felt guilty that he could not protect another.
He thinks murder helped two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the opposing factions of the cartel fighting against the children of Guzman.
The publication could expose the children; the people who were alleged to be members of the gang collected all copies of the publications as they were delivered to the Chinese.
The second error was that he did not prevent Valdes from leaving the country because of his own security after the arrest of another newspaper that wrote about the same story.
Valdes was a legend in and beyond Mexico, and his murder was judged as an integral factor in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been in danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norway, and in 2003 he sold his 50-dollar shares with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without involving drugs," Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of the courageous and honest publishing, sales and advertising of plants.
Journalists were delighted that they could publish bold reports, without fear of censorship, and that readers could read about what no one else had ever been able to write.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodos received a prestigious award from Mary Murs Kabo for the reporting work in Latin America.
That same year, Valdès won the International Press Freedom Prize for the Research of Mexico's Drugs, wherever it may be.
He openly admitted that he was afraid of him.
"I want to live further," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "the way of life," he said last October at the Romapevent TV interview.
"You have to take the tasks that are on you as a journalist - or you're just going to throw a piece of paper."
I don't want you to ask me, "What did you do when there was so much death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoses staff are on the way to Valdès, a hunter who runs like a freighter at the port, another, generous at the offer and advice, a teacher who knew how to live.
They relied on the order they had taken.
He should've always been wearing his shoes.
He had to go to El Guayabo, bar opposite the office, and always sit there for the same table.
Now they ask: Did he lose his love for the only way?
His death also caused them to wonder in their own accounts how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like when you get to know their wives, children, their legal business, and their sub-parliaments for the transport of drugs.
"These things were too short," said Bohorques.
As a result, even in the best of times, the level of self-censorship and self-sustainment was high.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what's wrong.
The problem, says the editor of Riodos, Andrés Willieral, that "the accusation can be false... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he and others say, are no longer active in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a food shortage of profitable contraceptives, weak public institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshawt keeps changing.
In the room where the Riodos staff were gathered for security training, hundreds of telephone calls were banned: a few days ago it was known that Spanish programmes sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico for the follow-up to journalists and public activists.
Two police couples are covered in a 104-degree wooden roof (40 degrees Celsius).
They were commissioned by the Government to protect the Riodos office, which is located in a four-story building in the Kulicana district.
Some journalists questioned whether the police included 50 per cent of the officers who had been told by the Governor himself that they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists were sent to the village, where they were de facto under the control of the gang of drug dealers.
In the next issue of Riodos, three main topics were considered.
It's the murder in Sinaloa's brother of an ex-commissioned champion, Julius Caesar Chavez.
They still had government spending concentrated in the hometown of Governor.
And there was a group of kidnappings in one of Kuliwana's most expensive restaurants in the district of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so there was a need for caution when it came to writing that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant of drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from the open database that the restaurant was registered on behalf of the ruling Institute for Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of authority over the past century.
In recent times, serious charges of corruption have been raised against several PRI Governors.
William asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo, Guzman, was separated from the army.
A few months ago, readers would ask the Waldes column for the most reliable information on theft.
"We'd already know what happened before," says 46-year-old Willieral, for his own selfish body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are destroyed."
Cabinnet Valdes is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the murder of journalists, because staff have become the ones they never thought to be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several complaints and sent the following morning to the local prosecutor's office.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Waldes was killed.
They found the body, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists began to express their voices, organize protests, and write SOS Press on the trouts and walls of houses.
On that day, the Director of Bohorkes was in Washington, attempting to secure international support in the demand for justice in the case of Valdes.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the next day after the murder of Valdez Ramires accused the authorities of spying for journalists and ordering them to kill for telling the truth.
She then asked her not to give her further information on the activities of the Government, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "rounded" by organized crime, by their partners in the government and by a different society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that the reporters were not merely killing the gangs of drug dealers; they were doing so on the orders of the policies and security services in the context of organized crime.
The Committee on the Protection of the Press, Arctic 19, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year have been carried out by police and government officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to close you," says Ramires.
Of course, murder frightens people.
They remember the death of blogger Mary Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note written by Zetas's author, "I'm here because of my articles".
The computer keyboard and the speakers were lying around with her cut head.
Some publications preferred to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to be held as El Manyan from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Díario de Ciudad Huares visited drug cartels with the help of an editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their own country or the country in general.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find jobs, and they're still looking at the dangers on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it appears, with a photo by Rubén Espinoz, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in the Mexico area three months after a flight from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance each day between risk decisions.
Ibara, who used to dream of being a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drugs.
"Mexico's falling into a coma, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, when the last issue was ready to be printed, the Riodos publishers sat on the truck next to the office and drank beer when their cell phone rang simultaneously.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the city of Masatlan left 19 troops behind, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to rage, as promised in the series of letters from cartels found in the region.
Sitting on the truck, they posted news on the Riodos website via the mobile phone.
The next day, the first page had to be translated.
Soon the siren was taken -- another shot in the bushes.
Bohorques saw if they were ready to defend their police.
If they had been terrified, they would not have shown it to them.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle palace was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued their work.
"How can you think of closing up?" said Bohorques, "if the day Javier was killed, the coach asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinosaver used a camouflage to avoid enemies
In the first instance, he seemed to be a statue, even though he was afraid.
The researchers said that the first found remains of the incredible substance with the size of the knife discovered by the Canadian chakra were so good that the experts called it "Mono Lisa among the dinosaurs".
It was so well maintained that they could even determine that the color of his purple skin was beautiful - and to say that it had, in some way, "the dark past".
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the best preserved from Tireophor for all the history of findings and one of the best examples of dinosaurs in the world”.
It is a recently discovered specimen of nodozavr, living in the middle of the millisecond period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition was felt by the researchers who called it “very remarkable”.
This trajectory is the most well preserved species in all history of discovery, according to the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shawn Funk when he worked on the Sankor Millionium branch shortly after Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He focused on something that was said to be different from the environment and decided to look more closely.
The discovered copy was sent to the Royal Tirrell Palace Museum.
Over the next six years, there was work to find an animal inside the earth’s surface with a mass of 2500 ft (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It is only easy to get excited, and it is possible to believe that it is asleep,” said leading author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tirrell Palace Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“It comes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-sustainable models of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
After studying his skin, the researchers discovered that it was harmful, although it was covered with pancreas and reminded the moving tank that there was a significant risk of platinum dinosaurs.
The powerful dinosaurs have used a white camouflage to treat insects, and they have used a protective technique known as a protection class, which is also used by many animals today.
This would make it easier for him to get out of the environment and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, assuming that larger dinosaurs were involved.
The presence of this creature over 110 million years of age related to the Nodozavre family was widely published in May, and is now at the exhibition at the Royal Tirrell Palace Museum.
The students had already studied the animal and given it the name Boraelopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum lab, Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours following his rupture.
The amazing sustainability of the sample enabled Dr. Mitchell and the international team of students to document the drawings and shape of the glass and plastics on his body.
They discovered a protected circle, a widely distributed method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the surface of the substance was darker than the lower part of it.
Although the protected area and well-exploited, openness has become unexpected, as the size of the Borealopelta dinar is significantly higher than the size of the living animals from the protected area.
It may be suggested that the dynamics were so actively involved with the platinum dinosaurs that the evolution preferred the masking of the confrontation as a way of survival.
However, most modern-day animals with a protected area — such as elephants, snakes, or bronchials — are much smaller and are more accessible, indicating that nodosavir has come to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat posed by hygienics to the mass, covered by the powerful pancreas of the dinosaur shows how dangerous the hygienic dinosaurs of the Mello period have been,” Brown told.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dynasopharynx also indicates that its skin should have been beautiful and fragile.
The students continue to study the animal, looking for information on its life, including the contents of its food contract, to find out what happened during its last visit.
They think that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he drowned and slept under the bed on the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Albert was as hot as now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans, most recently, were spreading much deeper dryer than now.
“This nodosavor is indeed remarkable that the fully-fledged skin will be covered, while it has remained fully in three dimensions, maintaining a significant shape of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal is now almost the same as it was then, during the early summer period.
It does not have to be taken into consideration in particular in order to recover it, it is only easy to be encouraged and it can be believed that it is asleep.”
During the winter, it was the era when giant terrorists, flat-footed dinosaurs, standing on two legs, sailed on the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrants of Rex lived for millions of years later than Borealopetta, some of his terrible ancestors could have been buried in the thireofor.
These include acrocantoseb, a marvel of 38 feet (11.5 m) deep in six tons.
Students who have recently been published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopetta was introduced into the sea after her death and was mumified.
The substance was found by Sean Funk, when he worked on the Millennium Square shortly after Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the world's most well-kept tyreophorus, along with the skin and pancreas, and its purpose from sea to shore.
The average of these substances reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
They were characterized by two twenty-six-six-six-six-six-square-square-squares.
The researchers believe that this trajectory was heavy because it was now Canada until the river was flooded into the open sea.
However, the underground storage of the dinosor kept its pancreas straight to the milkiest details.
The remains of this particular specimen were so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the burgery pancreas along the throne.
As Michael Greschko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the level of “order as a lottery win”.
The longer I look at him, the harder he seems.
The leftovers of the skin thus far cover the burgery pancreas covering the head of the animal.
His right front leg was pulled down the side, five fingers on it turned up.
I can count the stars on his head."
Mihail Saakakawvili managed to escape to Poland without documents
Michael Saakakvili, former head of Georgia, and then the Odese region of Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
He did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakwakvili is reported by the Polish newspaper Television Republic, which posted a video on its YouTube channel.
Saacawvili held an event in honor of the Warsaw Revolution against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since he did not know Polish, he had to speak English by means of a Polish translator.
In his speech, the political theme of Georgia's cooperation with Poland was also discussed in Ukraine.
Ukraine ' s migration service has lost its citizenship, and the general policy has been known in the United States.
He was able to carry out a transatlantic flight without documents until he was unknown.
Former Governor of the Odès area, Michael Saakakvili, stated that his signature on the questionnaire was issued to obtain Ukraine's citizenship.
The police emphasized that he didn't fill any anecdotes.
The outcome of the case of Weinziher and Olkhovic extended until January
The deadline for the preliminary investigation by the owner of the Renova Group of the Olkhovica Evgen and the Head of Energy T Plus, Boris Weinziher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court considered the extension of the alleged domestic arrest.
At the meeting, the representative of the SC informed the decision to extend the deadline for the preliminary follow-up.
“The special complexity and duration of the follow-up are due to the need to exclude and experiment with a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several FFR entities”, the investigator said.
He added that the suspects had regularly given the Commission's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least one billion rubles.
As a result, Vanziher, Olkhovic, and former ZAO Head of Integrated Energy Systems, Michael Slobodin, who, by 5 September, had led the company Vimpelko, provided the highest officials of the Republic with a commitment to establish maximum benefit rates for heat and electricity, as well as to create favourable business conditions.
Weinziher and Olkhovic were detained, staged in Styivkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin was excommunicated as a result and announced in a federal investigation.
How did one activist find the answer to the question “What are the streets?”
On 9 August 2014, British Ferrell was moved to the depths of the soul.
It was just a day after arriving in New York during a tourist tour of St. Louis's church, that he was sitting in a room rented by Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the telephone.
She went to a post from high school.
It was said, “The police only killed a eighteen-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street.”
I drew attention to the fact that no more of her tapes had posted this information, which she requested, closed the Facebook and opened a Twitter link.
There was a lot of user transfers with nothing @TheePharoh.
Reper from the Great St. Louis, in real-time mode, announced Michael Brown's death tweet, a non-armed 18-year-old minor, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of the undead body of Brown in the middle of the street, where it will be four hours.
"It's thickness," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She left the phone and came back to tweets later tonight about people being gathered on Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of a signal tape and screaming people and people who claimed that he was the father of Browna, who had been crying with the words, "The police from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw direct transmission as the police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators.
On another video, another policeman said, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"It's a non-standard situation," said Ferrell, in his own memory.
"This is not a murder like what we used to call it typical.
At the time, I felt terrible.
I was angry and cried.
She took a ticket back to the train and went home the next day.
On the 11th of the night, she took her six - year - old daughter out of her father’s house and decided that they were both going to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years became the theme of a new documentary film entitled “What Is the Street?, which will appear on the screen on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and stability in the eyes of people living in the community and in the streets, asking for answers.
While Ferrell went to Ferguson with a daughter, dressed in a flower and a flower-dresser, they recalled a talk that said so many times this morning, “about the experiences of black people and their situation”.
She said, ‘Do you remember how I spoke to you about the people in the dark about fighting for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take it," said Ferrell later.
"What's happening today is a culture of... what happened earlier.
She should know about it, see it and ask about it.
It should not only be a good understanding of activists and organizations, but also an understanding of the different levels of experience and their situation and what we must do to become free to be freed.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she doesn't personally deal with apparent racism, she's nothing different than any other black girl.
I feel that I would have given her an evil favour if she had been born out of it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, on the street from the police station, standing some kind of palace camp, while the activists were waiting for a report of the failure of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who produced the package chain.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protestors.
At least Ferrel's knowledge has changed the form of a new type of activism.
“My activity changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that, as a student of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Health Students, National Minorities, and she was a victim of food injustice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I didn't have an organizer's experience.
This has come only."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Saba Folayan, one of his organizers.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Fererer, “just wanted to document” the event.
Ferrerl came to his head and said, "Do you want to document or try to find a story to play?"
This scepticism has been spread to many people, often white people who have come to the community to benefit from its pain and stability.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are not at the centre of attention, and they want to do so differently.”
Folayan had already joined his director, Damon Davis, a local artist who was aware of his activities in the death penalty.
His participation created a sympathy for the project in Ferrell and six other local residents, with whom the project's command “What street?” has been supporting the link over the years following Brown's murder.
"In this documentary no one speaks for us or with us, that's what we're talking about," said Davis.
“This was the most important thing for me, how these people will be represented, because it is what I will be presented myself.”
And although the project was not focused on Ferrell's experience, it was in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader, but about how the community is united”, says Folayan, who was the most open of the film participants.
As a result of the “What street?”, Ferrel’s unexpected personal aspects of life, such as her love and marriage.
“I felt like I was,” said Ferrell, laughing about how the finished product was first seen.
“But I realized that when you do this work and you look black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel's story re-examines and focuses on the role of a black gay woman in a broader context of the movement of black people.
Two of the three drivers of the movement -- those who created the #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of the Black Death of Trevona Martina in 2012 -- belong to homosexuals.
“Black gay women in leadership support all this movement,” Ferrell says. “And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and the majority of gay black women”.
However, she insists that “it is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrell was not selected as a central character because of its outstanding features.
"She was the man who woke up this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was on the first floor, because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
In the meantime, there have been no cinema cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be two and a half years from the date of the six reopening at the time of the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called the home simply "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the thing she learned when she went out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We will lose nothing but our bones."
Two Salvadoran footballers were disqualified for the taste of American games
The footballists of El Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long-term disability for sports behavior.
During the fourth round of the gold cube of North and Central America's football confederations and the Caribbean (CONCAAF) countries, the salvadors were playing American games.
The first was the protector Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran tried the attacker, Josie Altidoro, and then he beat him in the chest.
The U.S. protector Omar Gonzalez was then tried by U.S.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.

Consistency: The artist creates portraits using DNA Chelsea Manning
In the center of the room in Friedman, New York, people are attracted by white, black and brown, something that does not look like each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Hizer Dui-Harborg from the juice and haircuts sent to Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent copies from Fort Levenworth Prison, where an ex-exploratory investigation was a 35-year-old for a significant transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, dated 2 August, is called "Revelation of the West".
This is the result of a two-year review between Dui Harbog, whose experience combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a woman-in-law and a prominent resident, whom Barak Obama sentenced for three days to the end of his presidency.
By analyzing and using the computer program of DNA obtained from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might have such a gene, Dui Harbog created a deep, though difficult to detect a manifest, not only about the plasticity of DNA, but also about the different ways of their interpretation and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also about the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but at an early age, openly said that she was considered to be a woman, 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the spying Act, computer fraud and violence.
Her photographs were not available in prison, so only one of her photographs was known: a black-white helmet on which Manning, in a platinum pocket of money, apparently felt naked, sat behind the wheel of the car; with this photo she became associated with it.
In 2015, Dui Harbog successfully completed his 2012 project on the Vision of the Unknown.
The artist has created portraits of unknown people with the help of the judicial image of the type of surgeons and the irony of the DNA bridge and the image of how these people could look.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dui Hogburg on the preliminary presentation of a new press release.
At the time, Chelsea was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to receive a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her cellmate became friends with the inscription and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of the comic books "Pounded Images", illustrated by Shail Canungo, who described how the future president would laugh at Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning in a few days after the book was released in the light made it a pleasant surprise after seven years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something profound and powerful, and that the exhibition is now being opened when Donald Trump announces war on people who are spreading secret information in the Government and finds new ways to survive in Twitter the enemy he is calling for to freeze.
When Dui Harbog was asked to do it all over time, she said that there was nothing.
In an artist's statement on the wall of the gallery, the grand signature of Manning below (with the heart rather than the “i” in her family) calls for the end of the “automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other hand, it is its mitochondrial DNA, a long triangle from C, G and A.
In addition to 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a science-based expression of the artist), Dui Harbog hoped to show us how amazing we are, in any case, on his biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our gene does not determine how many open genetic data we have for interpretation and how objective it is," said Dui Harbog; her 2007 video "Land memories" was also shown here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the novel mentioned above in the comics.
Its Manning in the King Kong style is shown above the U.S. Correctional Card building with a speaker in hand.
"If they kill your word, they will win."
"So don't ever shut up."
"It's the direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have a scar on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was seen in the comics - but when she comes, she will welcome masks in the center of the room, her own genetic simulations, which she has collected, called the crowd of protestors.
This is also done intentionally, as is the case with all the exhibitions up to the height (5-2, Manning's growth) on which the karandasa has been organized by genetic speakers.
"I'd rather blow them up on walls, but now I want them to look like a bunch of people," says Dui-Harbog about portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that was formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood for her release."
Professor of the North-West University and Officer of the University of Oxford is looking for the police to charge the murder
According to the police, there is a national field for the professor of North-West University and a staff member of Oxford University, who are searching for suspects of the fact that the death of a person was found in Chicago's annual census.
According to the Kuk District Court protocol, Monday orders were issued for the detention of alleged murder without the right to be released under the custody of the 40-year-old Windéma Latama and Andrew Warren for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton G. James Cornel-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after he suffered multiple injuries.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police called, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating the death of the knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latam took the position of an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of North-West from 2007.
Alan K. Cabbage, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latam is in administrative leave and that he is forbidden to go to the North West University Camp.
“It is now a criminal case that investigates authorized persons, and the University of the North-West is cooperating with the consequences”, said Kabbaj.
Warren is a senior staff member of the financial institutions of the Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have met with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the United States investigating authorities”.
The statement also stated that her colleagues were shocked and wanted her to leave.
The head of the police liaison of Chicago's police, Antony Guelmi, said that he was highly advised by the suspect to hand over to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our attempts to find them are strengthened,” said Guilelimi.
According to Guilel, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Gulelim, the police called the Grand Plaza building administrator, who received only a secret report on what happened in 1008.
The police called the place a terrible crime.
It was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
According to him, video camera data confirm that Latam and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that the professor of Latham and the victim were related to relations," said Guilelim.
The Grand Plaza Guide issued a call to the representatives who reported: “The police are currently working on the history of the incident, collecting information on the victim and examining several motives, including possible domestic events”.
Russian Vice-President Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-dumping Agency (WADA) to be re-established by the Russian Anti-dumping Agency (RUSADA) would be met in the near future.
"A certain phase of compliance has been carried out, the RUSADA has been entitled to plan and carry out tests in conjunction with the UKAD (anti-oping agency of Britain).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map on the restoration of the status of the Code of Conformity, which lists the conditions for the renewal of the work of RUSSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"All has been declared, everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IMO) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list suggests that the Russian Andiping Structures should publicly acknowledge the results of the Canadian Law Research Order of Richard McClaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sport is controlled by the State.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said: "We know the investigation because our anti-diping system allowed damage.
All measures were taken.
But there was no host program, and we won't recognize what wasn't."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Siminova, head of the Russian Independent Public Antidipping Commission.
On the same day in the Russian edition of "Rsport" Siminov recognized the earlier problems in the Russian anti-dumping structures, but he added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain positions and positions of dispute.
No one will ever accept this report," Smirinov added.
The WADA removed RUSSADA from the Duping Control in November 2015 after the Duping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate the testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-dumping Agency (UKAD).
Following the visit of the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA Olivier Nigley stated that RUSSADA “is moving in the right direction” to restore its work.
Fire on the 79th floor in Dubai
A big fire that occurred in one of the tallest buildings of the world, The Torch, a broken - down tower, sends Reuters.
It is noted that fires have been able to deal with all kinds of fires at 4.00 at local time (3.00 ms).
The local authorities reported that no one had suffered as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the roofing of the street was opened.
The causes of the incident are still unknown.
It has previously been reported that in Dubai, the 79th floor skyscraper, The Torch, is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the houses were temporarily evacuated.
An Inexhaustible House of Worship: Non-Smoking Bridges
Olga Buzova's scandalous leading "Dom-2" show hit the viewers of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in the streets.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, the newly revealed song with Nasty Kudri was filled with the song "It Will Be a Light."
Both girls went to the stage in provocational "brokes", which were cut so that there was a lower white bead.
The records of Buzova and Kudry were made on the books.
It was previously reported that a specialist in Moscow's plastic surgery had commented on changes outside of Busov.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, the Radio 4 news service reported a reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
At the CNN, NATO's gender also criticised Russia for the situation with the Crimea and "restablishment in eastern Ukraine".
At the same time, Stoltenberg was convinced that dialogue with Russia, however, was possible, and the further settlement of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier in the fourth century, United States President Donald Tramp stated that relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerous low level and accused the United States Congress.
Metro Ekaterinburg boasts a new way of paying
On a trip to the Ekaterinburg metropolis, a bank card could be paid in October, the OAO “I-Network” founder Paul Vedernikov said in an interview with the Oblast newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce the 2018 Football World Championship to the same system of travel as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, New York and Novosibirsk.
"We want patients from other countries, guests of the Mundial, to be able to use metropolitant using their bank cards, without buying cash and not standing around," he said.
The startups that will help your company not become a real Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among its e-commerce start-up staff, but the studies were not working.
The answers were often unappreciative, useless, or worse, inexhaustible.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not believe the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, manager of the 75 Madison Reed company in San Francisco, who is engaged in electronic hair care trade.
So she turned to the third person for help.
A new type of start-up in the field of work with staff is now being shown, which helps companies to understand how their staff feel.
By drawing up and licensing software for the purpose of measuring the involvement of staff, they enable companies to express requests, call on certain teams and demographic groups, offer anonymity and fuel line for complaints, and, in some cases, allow the informants to pass the workload and address the direction directly.
"We now have such tools as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, a member of Glint, and president of Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Errett said she had gained greater understanding of what her staff thought and felt over three years of using Glint.
In addition to the express requests and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company's warm map and shows in a transparent manner which units are more likely to complain and which managers are less willing to accept, which enables it to understand why.
The companies are less aware that they need to control the situation at the workplace, otherwise they will become an ordinary Uber, which was placed in a scandal when an ex-emplar posted a post in a blog describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed their discontent were punished.
For starters such as Glint, the desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the evaluation of the Internet portal, “Let us talk about payment”, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could amount to over $118.7 billion by 2020.
The “Convertent” in Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year on the Ubera reputation basis.
Convertent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently appeared among clients.
Like Glint, Convertent allows companies to send individual staff reviews, collect confidential responses in real time and watch hot maps of the problem areas.
It also provides a hot line for anonymous text messages that enable staff to report misconduct.
And if they touch the top manager, the complaints go directly to the address.
“The Court of Public Opinion took over the authority of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of the Conversent company.
If it is found that the company is dealing badly with staff, or acting in an ethical manner, even if the inspector is not involved, the company may be confronted with significant consequences in the form of client, staff and court cases, Queenland reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where over 25,000 employees work in 500 institutions, has spent more than a year to ensure that staff in the course of the rules and procedures, and to propose a simple approach to the company's headquarters.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a telephone number or a mail office, to file an official complaint and hope that she would be dealt with seriously.
This was often a frightening and non-violent experience reported by James Vitrano, chief of the legal administration of Ruby Tuesday, who said that it was not a normal way to track the complaints of staff.
Now, when a company is used by the Conversent Service, problems that were previously addressed by managers in other cities or states, such as discrimination, charisma and unfair wages, can be detected and dealt with as quickly as possible.
“I can draw close to the full, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff,” said Vitrano, who led the risk management team Ruby Tuesday network.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Queensland, companies began to deal more closely with the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting company suffered damage due to ethical violations resulting from del Enron.
But only when "social networks have received mass distribution", companies realized that they would not be able to keep their green white from viral distribution on the network.
“Before we started using technology to control ethical people, we used hope as a strategy”, he said.
Glint and Convertent offer their software as a service, taking regular payments from companies to use their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to approve venture investors who supported both start-ups.
In February, Conversent received funding of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total capital of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, resulting in a total company capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if they take into account the related nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
A growing number of studies show that staff today expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In the markets with high competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the minimum necessary.
Staff members want to hear that they are receiving and valued, and that they devote their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they are listening to them, and the work they are doing is more likely to make such a company successful,” says Nina McCuin, vice-president of global benefits and satisfaction of LinkedIn, where they are used and Convertent, and Glint.
Investors get income when things are going well in their portfolios; things in the company are good when employees are given and taken in.
If third-party analytical instruments promise to increase the dedication and involvement of staff, it is no wonder that they are supported.
It is important to have data on staff involvement, as the cultural experts believe.
But the data is useless until the company's sponsors take no action.
In fact, if the company requests staff for feedback, it may create an impression that there is a need for change.
And if the changes do not occur sufficiently quickly or do not occur at all, disappointment can develop and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to request 4,000 proposals, you must be prepared to make 4,000 budgets,” says Russell Rat, Chairman of the Advisory Group of the Kotter International Management Company, who had to see that companies made a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
If you do not come to the end, the officials will say, "Have you listened to me?
Aren't you all the same?
And if you're equal, why shouldn't I be equal?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, now conducting a monthly survey of staff, was able to take action on the same day when someone reported the problem with Glint.
And after withdrawing communications from staff, insufficient decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and provide communication training to solve problems.
The Ruby Tuesday company receives new knowledge of its staff and hopes that in the long term, these knowledge will help it to maintain its staff in a sector well-known for its high staff.
"If you do not try to create a culture of light, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaule, a new Asphalt is being built on the Kresnaarmei
In Barnaule, cardinal measures were taken to address the cause of the oil spills on the Kresnaarmey prospectus.
It's a place where we've got twice as much on a recently-floated passage (the crossing of the streets of Youth), it's decided to "get up".
Remember, the destruction of a small part of the road near the tramway was due to the passage of land into an unexploded network.
According to the Vice-President of the City Committee on Road Affairs, well-being, transport and communication by Ivan Garmat, a detailed survey and the elimination of prejudices will be carried out.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the launch of wireless communications and their concreteization will be restored.
This is reported on the official website of the Country Office.
Commander Browns is coming to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has suspended training twice a day.
The time is close to eleven o'clock; the football team at the University of California in Los Angeles is held to beat on the one hand the new training fields of the camp crew.
Some of them took their shoes, covered the back of the back of the truck after the very first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes are indistinct in the middle of the day.
The games recorded for summer work will be sent back to the community after three-hour training to prepare for final exams, and the following morning they will return to the football centre of Vasserman at the meeting at 6:30 p.m.
Not long before Monday turned Tuesday, the trainer of Brindisi Jim Mora said: “The children are waiting for mesorubs for the next three days.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was supposed to reduce the load for toys, was in fact delayed their working day, at least until the Friday exams were completed.
The first three exercises of the California University team in Los Angeles were therefore scheduled at 7:15 a.m. to move in and out of the record of the games.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings per day has increased the number of days with one training, and Brunss is moving into the camp nearly a week compared to last year, and training is taking place during the summer school for the first six months of Mori in Vesidda.
According to the schedule, they are expected to conduct 18 trainings by 20 August, including before formal training is started for the first game in the season against the team of the Texas University of A&M in September.
He said that he supported the change in the rules of the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that there was another item in the game schedule.
"For three or four days we will give them this huge load, this is a serious test," said Mora.
And they were not able to do it, but they were doing it.
I think that when we live till Saturday, and we have more time, that will be truly wonderful."
At the end of the camp, the California University of Los Angeles is training closed; this is a difficult task, as its field is directly visible from the adjacent parking lot and from the Laskin Centre, a long street, which has already been bombed by football bats, passing the protective net over the vans.
The Games from Brunswicks should take place from these exits, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, the problem may arise.
"We shall be protected," said Mora.
“This is a serious problem, and I do not increase the risk, assuming that someone can remove the room, sit there and record the training on the video.
If you have video training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security on the parking lot number 8.
We're doing everything we can with what we have.
I won't be too much to live for.
We have a plan."
All those who suffered from the trauma in Petersburg were reported from the hospital
All those who suffered during the earthquake in St. Petersburg Metro in April were told by the hospital.
This was reported in the press office of Deputy Governor Anna Mitiani.
At the end of July, there were three people in the stadiums, and the TV Center was transferred.
It is recalled that the explosion in the Metropolis of St. Petersburg took place on 3 April of the current year.
A bomb shot a terrorist killer Akbarzon Jallivov.
As a result of the earthquake, 15 people were killed, as well as the executioner himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abraor Azimov, were arrested.
It is recalled that Rospoebnadsor recommended that Metropolitan Peterburg review the road safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metallics.
Facebook enhances fact-checking in combating fake news
Facebook will send more and more disseminating texts to independent experts and to show their conclusions under original posts, the fourth largest social network of the world, which is trying to combat so-called fictional news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine training algorithms to identify possible misunderstandings, send them to check and possibly show the results of the check-in under the original post.
Facebook has been critical as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fictional news that, in many view, has had an impact on the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
The issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters have been misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May and in Germany before the September elections, they have declared support for the plan to strike social networks if they do not immediately remove hate-stricken posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing of the new fact-chakin algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what communications are being challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context in order to make reasonable judgements about what they are reading and what they are doing," wrote Sarah Sie, the news news manager on Facebook in her blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news chain in order to address the issue of fictional news.
Create a Roman-Committee: A Closer in English History
In the past, Scotland's short lock was taken off in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s, it served as a stopover for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years after his comfortable location in the Bay of Beul in Kent's county, he saw the turbulent history of the area, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a jockey with a red hair and with a sleekness to the historical documents, to the romantic comics.
"I think it's so beautiful - to look at a man's heart that died 300 years ago," he says with a smile.
"You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
Zamak in England covers a period from the mid-19th century to the era of the Evardian era and tells about families living in Scotland; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists — Aizek Lenkevic, Brian May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Grinberg.
This is not the first book of Rods based on archive data: in 2014, he wrote the death of a man and other stories, a collection of British Library documents; this project was suddenly translated into the depths of the soul.
"I could just print a hand on the end of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on jakobs," he says.
"It's a print of his hand."
And the letters are always a demon, because at that time the fire was burning.
And over 300 years, in the future, you'll be told that you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person covered by such a struggle to the old books, to receive support from the National Fund and the English Artificial Council and to stay in prison for four months (“I’m honest with you, I’ve been there for a while”), it’s too good to be true.
For the rest of the day, Rods studied the "new" Victorian castle, went through the archives and looked at numerous treasure and old things, such as the heads of cattle on the walls or the boots that have been in the woods for centuries.
He walked on the park and on the loose old castle, talked to the foresters, farmers, and sometimes to the artists who worked on the illustrations in his book.
And then at night, he "sucked the whiskeys and sat down to write."
The history of Scott's castle has not been studied very much, since the National Fund gained full access to it only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassie, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the staff only started to understand the archive he described as "that aristocracy has fallen on the rocks."
Journals, letters of the British Empire, maps showing who they owned, "You think the earthly disputes are broken," says Rods, but there were two families behind this market.
That's right, kids!"
In some of the history of the castle collection, there is a starting point for further research in English history: for example, in the "Robotnike", the hero is only a built castle to join the 1381 Creestian revolution.
"There is information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380 in the book "Kenta and Sassexa's Ricars", says Rods.
"The Christian resurrection began in these places, and I thought that the rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other contexts are closely related to the history of the castle, for example, the "Sacrifice", which tells of the priest-priests whose family Darrelov had spent seven years in the time of the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist", about 18th-century opponent Arthur Darrell, who, they think, designed his own burials, struck the grave with stones (it was discovered several years after the tomb was destroyed).
Darrell is a beloved family of Rods of all those who lived in Scotland: "Jentlmans seem to have been a perfect Jew, went into debt forever and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In various generations, Darrel men have resolved their problems with debt, married to wealthy older women - I represent them as a company of sympathical men who are capable of attracting the fruits of great fortunes."
After the end of the work in Rhodes, he seeks other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in a Finnish ear, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamanika -- a place where at the beginning of the 20th century was a painting, and then it was again redediced with wood.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I had a hard time walking," he says.
"I felt like this: I had to get back to real life again."
Fifteen major banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: seven other credit organizations, following Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Roselhozbank, Binbank and the FC, are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be at least as much of the ARB's refugees.
However, this is not just an exit - all banks that have announced a breakdown with the ARB - are negotiating with another public organization that combines credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks of Russia, which is headed by the known policy of Anatoly Aksakov, the President of the Economic Market Committee of the Gosduma, recognised, will conclude, following the last session and the most effective head of the thought committee and the delegation of the drafts prepared.
The start of the conflict within the ARB was at the time of discussion in the Federal Council when new legislation was discussed at the Interregional Bank Council, in particular the new classification of banks depending on the size of the capital.
Galegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that the bill was adopted in the opinion of the association for the benefit of larger banks, which were thus attempting to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by overcompensating their clients.
Among other claims was the criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the opinion of Tosuniana, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences to some banks, which, in fact, had been followed by an objection by the representative of the CB: many leading banks, in particular, outside the Bank, entered into the ARB governing bodies.
We see that this exchange of views is very sensitive to the main banking regulator and has become an obvious reason for the 50 major banks to disagree with the ARB policy, beginning to prepare for the entry into the Russian Association, noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB work will be low and that the constructive dialogue within the banking community will not actually be conducted".
Taggers will be better.
What's going to happen?
We are quick to respond to the key issue that arises in or around the smallest dispute or conflict in the banking sector: there is nothing to threaten, rather, the trust of the banking system.
Its title is “Rossia” Anatoly Aksakov, well-known as its expertise in the interests of banks and their clients, high-level professionals, which are highly valued in the Central Bank: virtually all CB leadership is in the annual activities of the association, and all important legislative initiatives by the regulator are carried out through expert "regions".
It is clear that there are no special concerns in the framework of the framework of the organization.
Without a doubt, the ARB is in a difficult financial situation after the lack of such strong and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in 1991 there was little capacity for the banking community to continue to improve banking legislation and the area of financial and credit management as a whole.
It cannot be said that, even in the Russian-speaking association with broken promises, the judge on the response of its leader, Anatolia Aksakov (“maybe too much)), who, on 21 July at Brifing in the Press Centre of Parliament, said that "Brussels representatives from the ARB banks had asked me to consider the potential of our Russian company on the following day."
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to give greater attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is now under way, examining the proposals of both parties, preparing a report of an extraordinary association meeting that will take place in the Council in mid-September within the framework of the International Banking Forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Anatoly Aksakov, also stressing that "the chair does not stand," called the possible new director of the updated association "Rossia" Georgia Luntuski, who withdrew in September from the position of the Vice-President of the Central Bank with a high character in his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now returning to Crimea, plans to stop and arrive in Moscow for one day at an extraordinary meeting of the Russian Association Council, where he plans to consider the report of the Russian Extraordinary Meeting.
The entry of a gas engine in the major cities of Russia will not be limited
The deputy head of Mintrans Nicolai Assault stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of a gas-powered vehicle into the major cities of Russia would not be restricted.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept, which needs to gradually increase the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going to the zeros soon.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, ever since?
That's the same thing at the lozung phrase level -- let's stop it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Is the whole city closed?
"For 20 years, I don't know, maybe this will happen," said Prime Minister.
The news magazine previously reported that, by 17 August, the vice-president of Arkady Drorković had been ordered to examine proposals for possible options for the maintenance of electrical transport submitted to the Government by PAO Director Camaz Sergeim Gogogin.
Among the proposals, on paper information, is the use of DVS cars in major cities and on the streets.
Washington is changing the rules for receiving a green card.
As reported by the media, President Donald Tramp stated that a new United States immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for receiving a green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants up to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary labour visas and restrictions on receiving family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two rooms of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and this is due to changes in the way the United States grants Greencards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces the total migration and replaces the existing scheme.
The new process of submissions will provide the benefits of candidates who have English, have financial resources that allow them to hold themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy.” Trip, according to the American media.
The presence of sex robots is real, and we should be worried about it.
We have failed to think that 2017 could no longer become worse, a new report on the technological progress in the production of sex robots has been made.
Mm-hmm.
Sex robots are now at the center of attention.
The FRR has recently issued a report on the development of sex robots for the next 5-10 years.
In the view of Noel Sharki, a professor of technology and the artistic intelligence of the University of Cheffield and the FRR, we must refer to their appearance as a whole.
Users can choose the color of the eye of the work, the shape of the hair, and the type of the leg.
"People are baffled about this, but companies are already sending their consumers a lot, and we will soon see them much more," Sharki said on the presentation of a new report.
Modern sex cults have evolved from their enthusiasts in work with syllonic skin, heat on the skin, and almost human republikas that control artificial intelligence.
Users can also "adjust" their work on their tastes by choosing all from the colour of the eye and the shape of the fruit of the work to the shape and color of the feet.
However, the fact that many workers have a “identity” compared to that of St.ford's wife would be very progressive, is even more worrying.
Modern sex clubs have turned into work with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot company allows users to put in the robots the quality they find attractive, for example, the urgency.
There are yet more sex robots Roxxxy Gold developed by True Company, which are already programmed individually - for example, Gold Fair makes the impression of a deafening, and Dicky Wendy has a "slow" character.
"The Roxxxy Gold has a beautiful character that suits you," reports the True Company website.
So she likes what you love, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She's changing her mood for the day she's got this man!
She may want to sleep or sleep, or she may be "in the mood!"
The presence of sex robots causes a lot of anxiety, not least because they replace real human relationships, but more serious concern is the subjugated form of women, the association with rape, which provokes the rule of the cold (responsive) fair.
"True Company" Roxxxy compares to the elector, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can be an elector, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" says the site.
But these sex jobs are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and their increasing complexity indicate something more dark and deep in our culture, a rejection of the idea of gender equality in the face of sexual desire, subject to an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although the FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very learned about the glorious era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
This is not a coincidence that these complex sexual acts occurred when the rights of women throughout the world were threatened when the President was in the White House, who praised what was happening to women.
The most frightening of the "Serving Service" television is not graphic images, body-dried images and revealing eyes, that is, how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is an increase, but it does not seem so much anymore.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to get this physical image to real women (only with porn star proportions), which allows technology.
Their Creator wants them to be spoken to by humans in order to copy the movement of the human body.
But the work itself is not like these women.
They can't fight with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or biographies - nothing that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of full independence.
In other words, it's a beautiful dress.
Or, as they say in 2017, servants.
The mayor of Los Angeles Jujin (Puh) Jetter, who has been speaking for the Ukraine Assembly since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball champion, whose final part begins on August 31.
In the interview with BeBasket, the General Manager of Blue-Reds, Andrey Lebedev, was informed.
We tried to make a deal with Jetter, but unfortunately he won't be in the family situation.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized game because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow for the development of our young players," he said.
Recall: With the direct participation of Jetera, Ukraine's collection took the sixth seat in Eurobosket 2013 and the first world basketball champion to which the wish-winning champion was unable to cross the group stage, while the U.S. champion picked up 15.4 shots, made 3 and gave 5 transfers.
Jetter stopped speaking about Ukraine's gathering from the position of chief coach of our national American team, Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will carry out its team tour throughout the occupied land.
The Sub-Committee of the Virgin Islands will have five units in Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5rd) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our male congregation conducted two control units in which Dutch and Belarusian people were allowed.
A big tramp?
I think Mita Romney is very reasonable.
In the past, Trumpa was a common ground for the fact that the political conflicts that polarized the American power plant have broken down some families into micronutrition.
In the middle of the day of thanksgiving and birth, American newspapers have been attacked by columns of how to deal with terrible relatives who vote for Trampa.
Looks like we're all so excited that we're getting worse.
They're less talking about the Trupa ability to unite the family.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, the left-wing poets of Chicago, who had been with the Republicans in his family for a long time, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that an alliance against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trampe in the White House, all she knew, including her brother-in-law, who had been arguing about politics for decades, were suddenly and strangely on one side.
Of course, that's good; but I can't think that in a broader context it can be dangerous enough.
The tramp has inspired power in the left wing, but the deforming effect of its rule can move us all straight.
When we talk about the tramp and the "normalization", we have a small chance that we will once cease to notice its exits.
There is, however, a more questionable scenario in which the Treaty "normalizes" the most right republics, which, in the light of its standards, will suddenly show a healthy sense.
I was convinced that I am very disappointed today about the old-fashioned mind of Mitta Romny - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14-percent income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - compared to the Trampa and that, and the other seems to be very small.
When the Trip goes, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his ability to see a great step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carousel in the Central Park -- the largest carousel in the department of New York Parks and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need coffee.
The bad guys are terrible and huge, images from the glass box on the central drums are huge clowns and animals that, in horror, look at themselves on the back, are extremely evil, and the wild music, as we are strangely, leads to the mountains.
So many well - known things in this city are disappointing: the skyscrapers are getting old, the walls are too strong to challenge, and the city's reality is not worth the effort.
Thirty-five years ago, and I still live the day when I learned that the Suiss Cottage region is actually not Switzerland's chess.
And the carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, wild place where children two years of age, children eleven years old and two women under 40 can spend a great deal of time.
If I could put the carrots, I'd put the five, but fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And at the university this week, I was asked to evaluate my "petch" purchase on a scale from one to five stars.
In coffee on the corner of my street, the same plus the option to include a 15 per cent tea evaluation is for a standing order.
As a result, it is not only a delay in the idea of interaction but also a personal relationship in a situation that is not expected of it.
The poor salesman in the universe was so impressed that I was able to assess my experience of receiving a credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of pain in the chest
Pistorius leaves prison because of his visit to the doctor the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of seizures, which, by the approval of the prison administration, resulted in a fall in the camera.
Pistorius was convicted of deliberate murder following the appeal of the prosecutor at the original trial for an indiscriminate murder.
He killed Stéencamp early on the morning of 2013 in the Holy Valentine's Day, several times through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he had taken his friend for a night's fight against him in the bathroom.
The Prosecutor stated that he intended to put another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretourius, which, she said, was too soft.
The Attorney General stated that the appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
The period of Pretorius may be increased by 15 years if the procurator succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A sign of non-exemptity was selected for the destruction of the TV journalist.
Senior law enforcement officers have chosen a cut-off measure in the form of a man's non-exempt signature, which has been attacked by NTV Nikita Dwarves on 2 August in a direct ephere from Gorke Park.
This is reported by the TASS with reference to the official representative of the IMF RDF IRINWOK.
"In the context of a criminal investigation carried out under paragraph 116 of the CFF (“Poboi”) against a 32-year-old man who was beaten by the correspondent of one of the televisions in the Central Cultural Park and the reputation of the Gork, suspected of being a violation of the sign of non-exemption and proper conduct," Volk explained.
The representative of the IMF added that an administrative protocol for the suspected failure of the police was formed.
On Wednesday, 2 August, at the time of the direct eviction to the DNW, an unarmed man appeared and struck his face.
As it turned out later, there was no relation to VAT.
According to the D.A., the dissidents, on the contrary, tried to keep the mosquet.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for an illegal palace stand
According to the Bi-Ti-Wi Telecano, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people placed in the open area, including two Bulgarian citizens, was arrested.
They were left alone on the same day as the result.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to the Bi-Ti-Vi TV that Bulgarian citizens had subsequently left.
The Greek authorities have exercised control over the free campaign and have already appointed serious punishments for all those who are in a state that is not intended for this place.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
IMD Russia accused the Vice-President of the United States of the Cold War of the Ritoric Time
Statements made during the European tour by U.S. Vice-President Michael Pensa have been criticized by the Russian media.
“It is sad to note that Washington is still deeply rooted in the primitive ideologicalized stamps of the cold war, which are totally de facto," said the Russian Foreign Office.
Thus, the MIDE responded to the words of Pensa on the Russian threat and attempts to force the border across what they were told in Podgorica.
The Russian MD indicated the destabilities of either " with the West or with Russia " and the indistinctness of thesis on the unprecedented entry of South-East Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that the United States had violated international law by using force to withdraw Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another form of tension.
“We call on American colleagues to end the celebration of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual interest,” said the Russian media.
Feldsher suffered in DTP with a "fast" in Podmoskoje
The TTP was in the basement of Stupino, and as a result of the encounter with the "Special Assistance" car, the Flanders suffered.
Today, about 08:10 msk has resulted in the car hijacking of Mitsubishi with the quick-assisted car in the city of Stupino, Moscow.
"As a result of the crash of the "fast" machine, the TASS announced in the press service of GU MVD in the Moscow area.
On the site of the TIR, law enforcement officers were working, and the circumstances were explained.
In the Obessian area, a woman was released on her newborn son's strike and returned to the cellophone package.
On the evening of 3 August in the Department of Police, a local resident reported that he had found a package with a young person in an inadequate private home.
"In place of the incident, law enforcement officers and doctors who have given the child an operation to the medical institution," they reported to the Head of the National Police in Odès.
Doctors have determined that a boy was born within hours of his discovery, as evidenced by the existence of a doll.
The birth of a 36-year-old local resident was established during the first operational and research activities.
It has also been established that the woman has three other children.
As noted in the chapter, in the case of law enforcement, the family was not in a position to fall into a particular situation.
The circumstances and reasons for the action have now been established by the police, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The young man is now under the supervision of the doctor.
As noted earlier, a 21-year-old woman in Nicolaeva fired her unborn child into the womb.
Grigory Leps: "I'm fighting, though 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian exhibition of Grigory Leps in the near resurrection will be 55 years old.
Before the show, the singer came in contact with the "News" suspect.
I remember how your "pocket" was noticed.
A special tent in the "Chiefs", Gloria Geenor is full of names, a powerful sanding over the Moscow River.
You'd be a little nervous if you wanted to spend your next five years.
Did the idea come true?
Speaking of profession, it was a successful period.
I worked a lot, I spent three times a year with all the country's restaurants, I gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, I'm not what I'm saying 20 years ago.
Biotimes don't lie.
Five times as much as I did in my 30s, it's getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stay.
And I'm with the new people, I think I'm going to get to another level.
With them you and the new album, the first three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Of course, we've already enrolled in my studio and now we're sending him to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious?" in the same song, written with Timita.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't even put her out yet.
We'll do it later when we take a picture of it.
And the album will be presented in November to a series of my public concerts in Moscow's Cross City Hall.
Your new plastic was attached to the hand of a classic American drummer Chris Coulman.
You think you wanted him and your restaurant?
In my view, Colman is one of the world's most outstanding drummers today.
He came to me to study, wrote his party.
I invited him to be part of my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer participating in various projects. "Evolution") suggested.
But for the long work in Russia, they were slow to say that the conditions were too extreme.
The word was from €35 thousand to €45 thousand a month.
At that time, I thought that even in the post-Swedish area, there were decent musicians.
And he found a great dancer, Max Malusheva.
It's better to feed your own.
At times, I want to touch one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly international.
It is composed of Western musical journals, which invite it to various guitar festivals.
Steve Way, listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't come to the United States alone?
Are you trying to break this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers involved in this matter.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't go to America.
I didn't say I was going to be there.
The more you interact with these professionals, the better.
We don't know them, but we don't have that experience, schools.
Before our performers of popular music for 70 years, the challenges that American musicians have always faced have not been fully met.
They were trying to make a maximum quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why did the Great Britain give me a ten-year leave?
But I'm still going to give visa documents to the British Embassy every year so that I can be allowed to build up there again and work there the most important.
The rest of Europe is very kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not an order, but an apocalypse, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sports Room in Monte Carlo, I've already spoken there.
They are now invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets to the concert have already been sold.
You're going to the Randow Lame Vaycule, which starts on July 20th in Jurmal, will you?
She invited me, and I finally called.
Lyma is a remarkable bird and a great woman who is able to give herself and a beautiful eye, even a hat.
After restaurants and public concerts, I know how much I know you want to turn to the creation of the Vladima High.
There are two albums with his songs in the chart.
When's the third time?
Probably next year.
But he'll be made completely different.
I want to write some 80-90 songs of the Highgate about the same thing as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangements.
Accompanied by me will be our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov.
I'm trying to get into the album and Alexander Yakovlewich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about this, we had a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it works.
You and Boris Grebenschco sing slowly into your repertoire.
Maybe you'll write his stuff then?
Boris Boris Borisovic is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I went over with him a couple of times and asked him: ‘ Can I sing that song?
He said, "Grigory, I will write the songs so that they can be fulfilled."
Please, try, come on.
It's probably interesting to write that album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, in two years, if Boris Boris Borisovic is not going to object, I might be doing this project.
If you don't concentrate fully on the affairs of your procuring center.
I think you haven't signed a contract with all the artists you've been interested in?
There are a number of executives that I would like to have under my wing, but they are the only people who are.
Do you understand Sergei Lazareva?
Serje is a shining singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his development strategy.
And now in my center, there's Alexander Panayot, whom I called "Golos".
We made a deal with him and we're working with him.
In our pop music, these things are rare.
If he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire. I'm taking the clips.
I'm hoping for a good outcome.
And I'm also trying to move forward with other artists in my center: I buy them songs, I cry, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of the telescopes.
If they don't reach greater heights, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a recorded album on the way out, a few clicks.
And if they wish, they can go on their way, and I will not force them to return their money.
Although I would be pleased if one of them was successful in business and paid me the percentages we had agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't work out, I won't be able to cover the oxygen for anyone.
Let everything work, break, prove how I ever proved it.
If you're offered to make a restaurant tour in Ukraine tomorrow and guarantee entry into the country, will you?
I'm still invited there.
It is mainly about closed events.
And what about a big tower...
I am the man of my country, a Russian, on my own belief, flew into Syria on the plane that then broke up.
If they say tomorrow that you need to fly to another point for the sake of the State, I'll take care of it.
And I'm afraid they both think of me as bloggers and other critics.
I'm really sorry that we got this situation from Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we should be together.
I'm sorry that this is not going to happen, at least in the near future.
And earlier this year, I had 40-50 concerts in Ukraine.
They met like they didn't.
Thank you very much.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, St. Lobodoi, Artem Loyc...
In Ukraine, the mass of the victims, and the sincere regret is that they are not now fully able to draw their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite a class Ukrainian executive in Russia, such as Slav Vakarška, to have a joint concert with him.
But, I think, at this point, it's a little bit...
Andreia Ohlopkova was excommunicated with cosmodrom
As was known as "E", the Technical Director of the Cosmodrom East Andrey Ohlopkov began working at the State Space Science and Production Centre (GKNPC) named Hruniceva.
He had previously been involved in the construction of the East Cosmodal, but because of differences with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Centre (CENCI), he was transferred to the Moscow Philies, where the production coordination took place.
Mr. Ohlopkova will not be: the position of the Technical Director will soon disappear, and the function will be broken down by CNCI units.
As Mr. Andrey Ohlopkov, the Technical Director of the Eastern and Under-Secretary-General for Technology Development, spoke on behalf of the GCNCP, "E" told the top managers of several space-based enterprises, as well as the Government's staff.
"He's been working on a new post for a few weeks," the "E" colleagues in the industry explained.
An operational comment was not received on Thursday, but Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for the comments.
However, the information "E" was officially confirmed in the GCC.
He decided to move to the office of the Director for Production Coordination, they said to the company. Andrey Ohlopkov, who had been assigned to provide for the first start at the East Coast, was fully implemented.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to the UNCI in 2013, with a team of space soldiers, in particular in Baikonur, and in Pleszecke, who took over the position of the first commander of the Colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
The result was the accusation that the regional traders had received the resignation of the guests, but had not fulfilled the obligations to collect the assigned parts of the rockets in the Arghäl area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the Court of Justice recognized him as innocent.
Its responsibilities for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main part of them became a cosmodal in the Far East.
At that time, the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in the interview, directly stated that the situation in the East “was critical in October 2013”.
The fact that a strategic error has been encountered in the planning process: the end of the strike and the launch of the first launch of the Union-2.1 rocket was planned at the same time as at the end of 2015.
In order to carry out the strike by the end of the year, the strike had been completed earlier, and the deadlines had been extended from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, CENCI specialists began to carry out a parallel installation of technological equipment on unmanned objects.
Andrey Ohlopkov was the main party of this idea.
Despite the existing risks and the current transfer (instead of December 2015 the Union flew only on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source of "E" to the cosmodrome: "We would still not have carried out any arms with the East, but would have taken the lead".
Vice-President Dmitry Rogozin, who was a cosmodrome-in-law, recently called Andrey Ohlopkova his "cosmic Susan", but he had almost always asked for information about the strike.
Mr. Ohlopkov and the direct: for example, in the interview "E" he proposed that the Federal Building Agency (Spection) withdraw the status of the sole executive in the East and work directly with the subcontractors: "Why should we all make eggs in one corner of Spectre?"
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the general contractor to complete the construction work on the start and technical complex planned for the fourth quarter.
According to Mr. Ohlopkova ' s "E", the reason for Mr. Ohlopkov's transition to the new workplace was the disagreement with the leadership of CRC on how to end the arms and space complexes, as well as working methods with subsidiary organizations.
"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," said one of the top managers who participated in the construction of the East.
The Government's staff member, in turn, called for a strange solution: "He was one of the best specialists, finding a equivalent replacement would not be easy."
According to the "E" data, this will not be necessary: the position of the technical director of the space will be abolished and its functions will be decommissioned by the CNCI units.
Two specialty education programmes will be presented in music schools
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to get two specials at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Science and Education of the Ministry of the Ministry of Science and Education of St.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we, together with the expert community, develop a mechanism that will enable two specialities to be overcome, but at the same time will not contradict the existing legislation in the field of education," said Golubenko.
In the past Friday, during the "Nedet Talk" talk, Maria Andreeva, a student at the Children's Centre, Vladimir Putin, reported that he had to pay for the second specialty in the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said she was studying fork and fortified and had a reward for the competitions on both sides.
The Head of State recognized her question very relevant and promised assistance.
In Mexico a 17-year-old Russian prisoner is detained on a roof wall
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who is standing on the roof of a tall building, reports the Portal El Universal.
An incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
She, with the help of two unknown men, passed through a three-footed plot on the territory of the Nestle office complex and herself took over one of his bunker.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and trust.
The young man has already been held on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security has put it on the ground on the helicopters.
Thereafter, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
There they find out whether a youth is legally in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man who picked up on high became popular in the Internet.
The users called the young man-pouch.
According to the MMI, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Fresh meat, milk products and chocolate can help to ease the CO2.
A beautiful meat and chocolate has been taken as a treasure for your food contract.
Recently, however, recent studies have found that diets, rich in fat whites and milk products can help relieve symptoms of those who suffer from respiratory infections.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, leading to deaths and deaths, chronic or blood loss, weight loss, and extreme maturity.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers from Washington University have found that the main amino acids of the white triptofan help produce immune cells that increase the tolerance of the fluid.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the refrigerator are being monitored to prevent food poisoning.
Cells capable of starting the combustion process are compared with cells that increase tolerance, protect the body and do not harm sensitive tissue.
If the equation is too severe to burn, it may lead to respiratory infections.
Experiences have shown that mice with certain bacteria in the bottle show increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria need triptofan, one of the building elements of the protein to start producing these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuter, which is part of the normal oxygen microorganism, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triphytophans were fed by mice, the more these immune cells had them."
He suggested that the same would be true of people: the combination of L. reuter and rich triptofan diet could help a more tolerant and less prone to environmental explosions in the kitchen.
Dr. Luis Servantes-Barraganvas, who studied the diversity of higher tolerances of immune cells, found that one group of infected mice had these cells and another group that belonged to the same line but had not been separately.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbes of the mouse — the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the cold-cooked trachea.
The DNA cells were sequenced and six types of bacteria were detected in mice with immune cells but not in mice that did not have them.
Mushima, developed in a sterile environment with no good microorganisms and not developing this type of immune cells, received L. reuters, and their immune cells appeared.
To understand the impact of bacteria on the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters into the liquid environment and then transferred a small percentage of fluids - without bacteria - to the undeveloped immune cells released from the mouse.
Immune cells have been converted into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from moisture, it was a sub-product of triphytophan processing known as indul-3-molic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the triptophan level was reduced twice, the number of cells dropped twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increasing tolerance of cells as the mouse, and most of us have L. reuter in their iron and oxygen tract.
It is not known whether triptophane-like products from L. reuter contribute to the development of cells in humans, such as mice, but in people suffering from respiratory infections, defects in triptofane-related genes have been detected.
She says: "We may need to strengthen the development of these cells, as these cells depend on the internal surface of the oxygen.
The high levels of triptophane with L. reuters can potentially lead to their population expansion."
According to José Mourini, the Manchester United genies channel in the face of Germany Matica
"Manchester Unaited" ran "genia" in the face of Nemani Matica, says José Mourini after the semi-protector deplores in the fight against "Sampdora" in the middle of the night.
A game acquired for 40 million pounds in Chelsea began with the victory of 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-recorded matte of UEFA against Real Madrid on Thursday, while the games of Paul Pogbe and Andreas Pereira broke before they were left behind.
However, just as Mattic did not participate in the Chelsea Presbyterian tour of Asia, he did not seriously miss the training for the game, and he held all 45 minutes, that, in fact, Mourinian, needed to be completed before the beginning of the premier season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his mind, he thinks about football," said Murin.
“We will help him to prepare for it sooner or later.”
Like Mattic, his new-new players, Victor Lindeloff and Romel Luka, started playing at the Avova Stadium when Mouriny began to form his main composition at the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinie wanted to hire three more games, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results, three of the four games he wanted to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for having won three of four.”
I will do more if they reach four, but they have grown very old for me."
Former leaders of the Lithuanian Social Democrats urged them to remain in the right coalition
The former presidents of the Socialist-Democratic Party of Lithuania, the ex-presidents of Alguruds Butkyavicus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the social-democratic summit of Cheslovas Jurscheas, called on the parties to remain in the right coalition.
As the Parliamentary newspaper reported, for training with partners, the Union of Cristian and Greens, the Social Democratic Party has launched a discussion on whether to remain in the right coalition.
These three older companies have referred to the parties with an open letter, in particular, saying: "The continually disappointment of the party with the results of the elections, but the association with the "Cristians" has created for us freedom and not very easy, but all the conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals, which are provided for by our initiative in the Government programme and for the maintenance of the political domination of the left-wing centre over the legal parties."
In the view of the former leaders of the party, the discussion was still “founded on the basis of emotions without specific arguments”.
The authors fear that unexpected actions by their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anno Mamaev's disabled brother appointed the punishment
Mosgorsud reduced the punishment of the disabled colleague Anton Mamayev from four and a half years of deprivation of liberty to a fine of 200 thousand rubs.
The former decision of the Timorese Court of Justice was released from SISO.
At the same time, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had organized the theft and theft of a motorist in an ex-sex fighter.
Mosgorsud's decision reduced the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubs.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the dispute, which also constitutes a crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility,” explained the press secretary of Mosgorsud Uljan Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account the state of Mamaev ' s health, the actual circumstances of the case, and the absence of the circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied paragraph 64 of the FIFG, which provides that a penalty may be imposed below the threshold.
With regard to the assistant of Mamaeva Vasilia Serochanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would serve as a basis for changing the category of seriousness of the sentence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he remained dissatisfied with Mosgorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be a justification to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not exclude the appeal of the trial at the Mosgorsud prison and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the rice immediately to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "REA News".
Remember, 28-year-old Mosquik Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophic, became a criminal figure last year.
The disabled claim that he bought a motorist in some 160 thousand rubs to sell it.
However, the owners of the motorist, among whom the former fighter of technology, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasili Serochan, had chosen their property, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the District Court of Moscow sentenced Vassili Serostenov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamayev, four and a half years in prison with a sentence in the general regime (para. 2, p. 162, para.
After the injured person was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, Genocura, authorized for human rights with President Tatyana Moskalkova, was seized.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO by the same decision of the Timorese Court.
Protection, in turn, appealed to the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
UNFPA prepares the president's report on the environment
In 2017, the Open Action Forum of the General People ' s Front (UNF) will address environmental issues, reported to the UNF source and confirmed the head of Alexei Anisimov's deployment.
According to him, the Forum plans to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the home environment and to propose a strategy for their decision.
UNF ' s experts noted that the report of the Head of State would contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal areas of the country.
According to the Information Forum, the UNFPA outcome will be a step forward.
The exact date of its operation has not yet been determined - usually under the schedule of the President, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present in key activities of UNFPA.
Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Rostov na Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The summit will be held in the capital of the Republic of Burundi, Ulan-Udé.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be discussed at these events, we and our systemal proposals on environmental issues have been developed, as told by the UNIFEM co-convergencer.
The Co-Chairperson of the Olga Timofeva Central Movement Committee of the Gosduma Committee on the Environment and Environmental Protection reported that "Front the Frontwichs" were attached to the Head of State for the work carried out during the Year of Environment in Russia.
The cost-effective environmental forum and the UNFPA Action Forum will soon be combined.
Over the years, we have expanded a strong expert team on environmental issues, saw gaps in legislation, left ten violations of the law.
All of this will lead to a report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the Frontiers are also reporting on the work on UNFPA priority projects - she told Olga Timofeeva.
She said that the forum would also be invited by the Special Representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport of Sergei Ivanov.
He had previously participated in the UNFPA Media Forum, which passed to St. Petersburg in April.
Within a few months, the Year of the Environment will go back to history, and the most important thing we need to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To prevent these issues from happening, she added Olga Timothy.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Studies (ESI) noted that, as a major environmental problem, UNFPA is acting on a presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts have proposed in various forums, and these initiatives have been supported by the President, Andrey Kolyadin said.
He stressed that the economic capacity of the environmental agenda could not be excluded today, which could give regions additional impetus to development.
With the help of UNFPA, the regions can also challenge not only their environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of the environmental issue was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President asked questions about the Mossack in the Bahamas (closed) and about the coal dust in the port of the city of Nahoka (a draft law on the prohibition of the open-label conversion of carbon into human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timofeva).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia is generally established, the issue is in further legal practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
There is a need for clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State - the head of the Ecology Fund for All - Leonid Bochin.
A member of the COP, the head of the non-governmental organization Grinds of Russia, Sergei Cyplenkov, in his discussion with the News, stressed that a responsible approach for society and business, one of the legislative efforts, was needed to address environmental problems successfully.
Only in society and business know that the solution to environmental problems is a much more positive step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, notes Sergei Cyplenkov.
The expert stressed the need to overcome the tendency to violate environmental legislation as an economic advantage for business.
The British rescuer used his microchip to fall into the house and car by hand
The British rescuer became the first person in the country to have a microchip to open his house, to enter the office, and even to drive a car using simple handcuffs.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Nortem has lived a short chip between big and noticeable fingers and now through his BioTek company, he offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives by using technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal Council in Winchester, concerned that the procedure of use should be carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology looks like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes 30 seconds.
Nortoma's company also replaces house-to-house closures and cars with a price chip at 300 pounds per lock.
The father of one child has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which happens when his hand is on the wheel.
The record for the White House is worth thousands of dollars for taxpayers
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the TIME magazine, the decision of the White House last month to bring a seagoing vessel to the South Pole to an event involving the American industrial production amounted to a total of $24,000.
White-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, was a central element of the event in the White House on 17 July in the United States Building Programme.
President Donald Tramp, Vice-President Mike Pens and senior officials of the White House have looked at technology products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was set up in a row with a train from the state of Man, a fire car from Wisconsin and a driver from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Oscadril of the Marine Pedestals (HMX-1), a department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House's military administration ordered the presence of the helicopter in private order, or the FRAGO, for 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Pole in case of an “unnormal” event.
“I just wanted you to be convinced that you are in the course, because it is a very unusual event in the press,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to his boss, the first airman of the Marine Fishing Corps.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Pole at about 7 a.m. on 17 July for the three-day event and remain there until the gas is released between 6 and 9 a.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second flight crew will be required in accordance with the time limits of work.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the operation, and the unit security officers remained on board a number of aircraft until it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by the TIME magazine whether the second container was needed.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal officials from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 explained whether the event was not contrary to that decision.
"Of course, we have asked if this is not the Hetch law, and we have replied that it is not," wrote the commander.
"It seems like you've got nowhere to go," said the deputy officer.
The event was announced in the White House as an official event, and the law of Hetcha did not extend to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote health reform, which was then being developed in the Senate, and praised efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly new.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only for photos of them is unusual.
The tramp was already the subject of discussions in February when the presidential plane was on the ground during his first pre-election mission in Melbourne, Florida, and his account in Twitter was filed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House, in the spring of the “America” exhibition, where products from 50 States made by American workers from American materials have been presented,” said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House of Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 teams often carry out training flights around Washington agglomeration and on the South Pole to prevent the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House directly before the roof.
When Trump was in the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training trips to the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the "America " activity was calculated by the trainer for the required training flights per month.
The Unit's helicopters also spent 11 additional hours on non-presidency support tasks.
According to the White House, not one of the other exhibits submitted to the event was incurred by taxpayers.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company did not participate in the demonstration of the helicopter in the South Sea.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget on the presidential fields, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence's time rate for 2017 fiscal year, the rate of compensation of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 during the summer.
The unit records indicate that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes per side with its aircraft based on the Kuantiko Marine Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual value of using the valve is much lower than that rate.
“To estimate the value of taxpayers based on an exemplary rate of refund, which is completely false,” says Walters.
“These examples include the personal composition, service and many other non-recoverable costs included in the annual appropriation”.
According to a study conducted by REND in 2015, reimbursement rates do not include the value of the personal component, but actually take into account the value of the fuel, services and costs mentioned in the contract.
At the time, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, spoke for protection of the use of the speaker for the event.
“The idea of demonstrating this week the things that are done in America,” Spicezer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military technology, which has always worked so hard on the Americans.
That is why, of course, it is appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unusual if Trip had been involved with the helicopter watching the South Pole during the event, but he had just settled in the driver's seat in a fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky's representatives, looking for a press on his own product fleet.
"I know Sikersky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."
Moscow grants to municipal hospital rehabilitation offices
Each year, the life-threatening gloves will be distributed to the rehabilitation and intensive treatment of capital clinics.
The media are encouraging doctors and medical sisters.
Mr. Moskov Sergei Sobayin visited the City Hospital called Judina.
During the examination of the clinic, he wrote a letter of thanks to Dr. Victor Procco, who was guided by a more complex operation on the reconstruction of the ageing rate.
Sergei Sobayanin also discussed the decision to allocate annual rehabilitation and intensive care to urban clinics.
The funds will focus on the encouragement of doctors and medical sisters.
According to the capital mayor, the clinic for the name of Judea today is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, a new modern equipment has been provided that allows doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the foundation of the Columbian rural hospital.
There are currently more than a thousand patients in the medical office.
In addition to the repairs and the stationery, there are daily offices.
The state of hospital staff accounts for 2800 people.
The total area of the medlin is 23.7 g.
In February of this year, the media has been a participant in the pilot project for the organization of short-term housing stations (CSC).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In the surgical intervention process, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation at the station, they've been doing everything for hours.
Only after the first half of the current year in the clinic, the name of the hospital was given to 36 thousand patients.
Medical staff have performed 15800 operations at different levels of complexity.
The NBA reported that there were no buyers of the Ukrainian "girls" Sberbank

Said Guceriev, the son of Russian businessman Michael Guceriev, was a major shareholder of the Consortium.
The sanctions against the daughter of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they were prohibited from disposing of capital from the country for the benefit of maternal organizations.

SF released Oserova from office of the Committee's head
The Federal Council supported the statement by the Chairman of the Committee on Defence and Security, Victor Oserov, and released him from that position.
He remains a senator from the country of Haborov.
The application for his release from Oserov ' s office was written last week.
He explained the need for rotation and his desire to change the pace of life.
The Senator also noted that the treatment decision was not sequential.
Since 1996, Victor Oserov has represented the Legislative Assembly of the country of Haborov.

Electricity is also available for residents, and for the product producers in Burundi
Not a decade of efforts by the Soviet and Portuguese authorities of the Republic of Burkina Faso to establish fair tariffs for electricity users have begun to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, 25 per cent of electricity is reduced by low pressure for industrial recipients.
The Federal Anti-Employment Service of the country, in accordance with the Government of the RF Regulation, "To make changes in the Optimum Energy and Power Market Regulation and in the combined forecast balance of production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Russian Energy System for Russian Federation entities" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842), established an indicative price for electricity and power for industrial users of the Republic of Burundi.
As a result, the cost of electricity for storm producers is reduced by four, which will significantly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual enterprises.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have been working on the shortcomings of the Moscow Cabinets in an effort to compare the region in tariffs with the nearby Iraqi area with the cacadium hydroelectric power station in Angar, from Baikal, the main source of water supply for which Burundi is.
And that's just the beginning of this year.
In March, electricity prices for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rubs/kVtch to 3.93 rubs/kVtch, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of the Federal Government ' s decision-making Bureau in the List of the Price Areas of the Optical Market, which sets out the characteristics of the functioning of the optical and disseminating markets across the industry.
In the view of analysts, this only started because the population of the Iraqi area paid for the 1.01 rubles.
However, no one is considered to be calling the date of the approaching new tariff movements due to the decline in Burundi.

National trade union of unqualified, municipal and coastal workers (GMB) concerned with the capitalization of McVitie's factory in Glazgo
The trade union requires guarantees from the management of McVitie's bikini producer in relation to its long-term obligation to manufacture in Glazgo.
Scotland's GMB reported that the company had failed to raise the issue of future investment on a multi-stakeholder facility.
More than 500 people are working on the factory, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis company, owner McVitie's, reports that over the past few years it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that, in the case of any changes in the staff and representatives of the union, they “know them first”.
In a letter to the manager of the company's property, the Scottish office of GMB required McVitie's responses to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernise production lines.
The senior organizer, Dr. Daffi, said: “The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get the insights from the general manager of the business and investment plan on the future of Tolcros".
The families worked here for generations and the concentration of large labour in the local community and in the territory of the Great Glasgo; this was the most important stage of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and promotions, and on the basis of Brexit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic fall of production, East-End Glazgo is expected to be needed in the development of production at McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The head of the ultrasound facility only received a letter from the Scottish GMB office yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with staff and trade union representatives”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with staff and representatives of GMB in Tolkross, where several issues were discussed openly.

Putin stated that the authorities would not give Rosneft and Gasprom instructions
Vladimir Putin stated that the supply of gas to the East Petroleum Company (WNHC) should be linked to Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one would be provided with the "Gazpromo" or "Rosnefts".
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igora Secina to assist in resolving the dispute.
The Head of State pointed out that the relations between Rosnefti and Gazpromo should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Previously, the chapter "Rosnefti" Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Southern Federal District, said that there was no agreement with "Gazpromo" on gas for NHCW.
Secin noted that dialogue with the "Gazpromo" on this issue continued.
"Gazprom" offers to find gas resources from the "Rosnefty" perimeter, but we don't have such resources," added Secin.
We remember that Rosneft asked for permission to use it for the East oil company gas from the Kirin site of the Gaza Strip, located on the Sakhalin Shelf.
In June, Gazprom stated that the negotiations on this issue continued and that there was no "silhouette" there.
Did the PSC Barselon warn of the transition from Nemara three years ago?
La Ligi can ask for his interest in Marko Verratti
"But St. German" does not stop following the club's offer of 189 million pounds for its ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the global record of the loan being held three years ago?
The Sensational proposal was restored by an earlier transfer window when the League 1 Club was ready to win a world transfer record more than twice the previous note relating to the return of Poland Pogbe to Manchester United in the previous session of 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Nemer will become the most expensive game in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional sportsman in the world, as the PSP offers him more than 500,000 pounds per week.
It is known that Barcelona and the lightness of the proposed proposal and how Nemer broke the contract despite the fact that, despite the pressure of the source, close to the head of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible to play since it moved from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warning of this possibility three years ago by the President of the PSP?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the 2014 Blasa Matuidi occupation, Nasser Al-Heljafi gave a sharp warning to any club that would want to replace one of the best games in the PJS.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they attack one of our games, we will attack them, and we will attack them," said Al-Hhaifi.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to hide one of our games, they will have a great reward."
The Court of Justice, Barcelona, crossed this line when the Spanish club, earlier this summer, expressed interest in the PJP semi-protector Marko Verratti.
The PSC understood that it would not allow the Italian game to be won under any circumstances, and now it is likely that Barcelona feels the impact of its proposal on the loss of one of its most valuable games, Nemira.
