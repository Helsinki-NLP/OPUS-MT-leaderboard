That's what I want to do.
She's starting.
I live in Athens.
Tell me about your wife.
This is for us.
These ladies are my aunts.

She doesn't have any right feelings.
In other words, he gave us.
Looks like Tom likes it.
He was completely far away from the conference all the time.
Don't go now, we're ready to eat breakfast.
Where do you live?
I can't believe you like that restaurant.
Is that your first time in Korea?
No, I don't think so.

He built a baricad on the road.
She was very nice to me.
Who's the better?

What are you talking about?
It's low and heavy.
I feel free.
She's got a cold head.
I want it too!
They couldn't cope with the difficulties.
Do you have any objections?
I'd take a little weight off.

Nobody believed what I said.
Greetings are always sad.
Though he also lives in the United States, Thomas does not learn to speak English.
Why are you feeling that way?
What food do you have?
It's not bad.
No, he's not my new kid.
You can't just leave.
