European inflation has been cut in food
The rapid inflation rate in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid growth in food products.
The November price increase in the euro area was higher than expected in 13 countries, with a 3.1 percent annual inflation recorded after the 2.6 percent of October, according to the Union’s Luxembourg statistical office.
The official announcement confirmed only 3 percent - Bloomberg said.
Unlike the European Central Bank (ECB) in the United States, the UK and Canada did not want to be on the ground, it was said that the reduction would lead to the emergence of inflational flows with increasing raw materials and unemployment.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in its second chapter: "you must speak" the inflation so that no further action will be taken on this subject.
In Germany, the November inflation rate is 3.3 per cent for twelve years; in Spain, it increased by 3.1 per cent.
Eurozone inflation has been high in the raw food and energy sectors.
The final notes were increased by 88 percent, and the price of the word was also the highest since 1973.
Food and dairy products were also substantially more paid in 2007.
The world price for oil increased by 52 percent this year, and in the past month, nearly $100 has already been sold in a round black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 is reduced by 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent of time to 2.5 percent in 2008 but has already declined to 1.9.
Researchers estimate that the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will double its deficits during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The Fidesz supporters grew significantly after a long stop in December, so since 2002, they have been with the largest teams, while Gallup has not yet measured such low, 13 percent socialist support.
On the basis of the greater frequency of the opposing voters, the parties will report more than two-thirds (71 percent) of aid to MSZP in view of the one-half (20 percent) aid.
MDF and SZDSZ, according to the survey, are under the parliamentary rule: two percent of the aid granted to the whole population.
The support of both groups among the parties to the vote is more than one percent.
The economic balance was still broken down in the previous depth - there was never such high, 41 percent of those who were judged to be very bad in terms of the country's economic situation, while 46 percent said that the situation was probably bad.
The family’s own material situation is now judged again in a pessimism after the more promising experiences of Tavás and fascists.
For the next year, the majority of the population will continue to vote and only 10 suggestions.
In December more than any earlier survey of Gallup, 71 percent of the respondents considered that the Minister was worse than the Minister's job was done well.
In Ferenc County, 13 percent of the respondents believe or are very confident, while 38 percent of the supporters are from Orbán Victoria.
At the same time, 54 percent of government heads are not trusted, 27 percent are in the President of the Federation.
One indicator of the political situation is how many parts of society think it can be dealt with without a change in government.
While 35 per cent of the government and the government were willing to remain behind after October's disturbances, this rate is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees only the solution in the new elections.
It is of interest that 60 percent of the respondents are responding to the question of the question of participation in the polling process, and another 20 percent are saying that they are likely to go.
In comparison, only 55 percent of the country's "sustained election" would be involved and another 15 percent would be likely to participate. The result of the vote would not be a question on the basis of current opinions.
The students were 74, 79, and 84 percent told me about the hospital's daily.
If we are sure that the participants are in favour of the vote, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters will be required to introduce students, nurses and hospital staff.
The most beautiful is Auchan, about five times the Tesco.
In the Bulgarian trade, the hypermarkets included an average of 16 percent price increases, with the difference that the tax had not increased in the year.
Articles of the Economics of the Day
It also increased by 16 percent in the Buddhist trade in the traditional Christmas cup of the Napi, but in each hypermarket, there was a significant rise in this fort in value.
Since prices have already been "resolved" in food stores in December, so the first high base was no longer shown as a percentage of tragic trauma.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what they were able to afford under nine of these forums is no longer available to them for ten years.
On the day of the day, at least 91 Forensics in the hypermarkets under review crossed the 10th stage.
And the highest price was 10,573.
(The course was held at 6800 Fort in 2003.)
The price of Unicum and the living death I almost stayed at the Tatar level, but he was deeply in love with the pukyam cell, the dio and the liver.
KSH's data were followed by the price of the liss and kenar in the business, and we may have found a kilogram of cheese in Auchan for 139.
Competitiveness did not lower the product price below 200 fort.
At the same time, it was amazing in this business that the double-responsible pancake coca-Cola price was below 200 fort, so only 257 forts were requested for the product along with its bets.
Together with this, however, Auchan showed himself in the sunglasses as the most beautiful as the Cora is the most precious.
According to our estimates, the average Christmas price is equal to the Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices in the Napi district by about 18-18 percent.
In addition to the most expensive and the most expensive prices for time, the difference was 12 percent, whereas the lowest for time was 21 percent.
In Forint, there was an average increase of 1480.
The average price increase was due to 1206 fora, so that it felt its effect on the prices of the tax.
In fact, this process has led to trade, which seems to have not been able to alter the price of the goods used for one product, which would have been able to calculate the impact of the sale on the consumption.
(If a product has a poor marketing rate, the trader shall make a serious use of the butter at the price fixed for marketing intensification.)
The price of the Napi goat was so high that the lowest price for 1720 was higher than the 2006 value, while the lowest was only 844 for the total price.
In recent years, this greed has not been shown, since the most expensive 1630 was more than usual and the lowest was 1284.
In combination with the two Christmas season, the catastrophobic price increase was shown to be more than 30 per cent for less than 20 months.
(In other words, this does not necessarily prove the data of the KSH: more than 30 percent increase in prices over 12 months in the case of some basic foodstuffs by the statistical office.
For example, next to the list on the tea.)
According to the Daily Survey, this seems almost impossible at the end of the day, since the average price price of the already expensive product has been reduced by almost 10 percent in the worst case.
The list vendors are in a stronger position than the fishermen, the dramatic increase in prices has also been achieved by many.
In the trade fair, the Himalayas do not complain, constantly count on a good year.
We found that in the three requested businesses, prices are no longer relevant for the buyers' heat.
They buy a lot of money from everything, they pay back their long-lasting food.
Before noon, all three stores had serious times before cashiers because the number of visitors had grown rapidly.
However, we know that in rural areas, more and more companies are concerned about the fact that they are not only food but also sustainable consumer products.
In many places, they'll be able to store them in front of the front door.
More than a hundred cases of infection have been reported in hospitals that are primarily due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The health conditions of hospitals, sleeplessness, overlife of staff are not desirable for the prevention of infections, is the principal doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
There's a lot of places to play with the power-savings.
A recent MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological class of the Janos Hospital.
After a serious accident, a man was exposed to antibiotic bacteria.
The patient was separated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident was allowed to come home from the hospital, but it was soon to be returned with MRSA infection, and it was not possible to perform an important surgery because of the bacterium in its body.
This year, from 10 December to 1094, a multi-resisting disease was reported to the National Nosocomial Survey System, the National Epidemiological Center’s principal doctor, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that these multi-resistency patients have definitely registered the infection in their hospitals, which they do not know about.
The infections were similar to two-fold (683 infections) in the MRSA, i.e. the cause of staphyllin-oxacillin resistance to staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are administered by humans without one third of the population in order to cause the disease.
The infections caused by SA (e.g. tortoise, mandating, skin infections, infections) are well responded to antibiotics and can be treated.
However, if antibiotics are used in excess of or inadequately, they develop a highly resistant bacteria that quickly spreads into inappropriate hospital conditions from a highly reactive bacteria to antibiotics.
In particular, when the immune system is operating in a transient or persistent way, severe hospital infections may occur in patients who have been treated with moderate, chronic or low body weight, such as infections or bleeding, may occur.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special in the MRSA infection, such infections are associated with day-to-day practice of hospitals.
The infection must not be combined with the virus, MRSA is just not there, said Nyulasi Tibor, where they do not investigate the presence of the disease.
Illusions for antibiotics
"We separate these patients, the patient is in rubber and masks, and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Nyulasi Tibor.
Patients admitted to the hospital are being tested to see if the MRSA is present in their organisations, but it is not always possible to prevent infection.
I don't like the dream.
The majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current home hospital conditions and circumstances do not favour the development and distribution of multi-resistency patients, says Böröcz Karolina.
After this infection occurs in hospitals, in elderly patients should be monitored for infected patients and should be immediately separated from MRSA patients.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, there is no magic with microbiological imitations.
This also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
The majority of these cases occur during the day when MRSA is reported to be a significant infection of the patient, said the principal doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine and has home guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be intended, i.e. microbiological tests should be performed to prevent resistance to medicinal products, but hospitals are not included in all cases.
The microbiological models are even more rare in the diagnosis of eryophobic disease, Böröcz Karolina.
Sporols in the fertilizers
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is one of the most common diseases of the medical staff.
For this reason, the use of handwashing, the use of masks is very important, but there are significant deficiencies in their hospitals.
However, it is not always possible to distinguish the disease from the affected patient from the disease in the home in contact with MRSA.
In fact, cardboards have often been broken, often very close to each other, and these should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other in terms of both driving and driving.
Unfortunately, also experienced, Böröcz Karolina noted that patients in adverse material conditions are exposed to infectious diseases, fewer patients, many patients, and even greater opportunities for the occurrence of infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, it may be less likely that such a infection will occur or may be continued.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection causes serious expenses to health insurance providers, so they fight against each other.
In England, for example, the government programme was involved in reducing or reducing the prevention or conversion of MRSA.
According to the signs, the program is successful, based on the data published, showing a decrease in the trend of MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) includes multi-resistency cancers (including MRSA) and prevention of diseases caused by such diseases.
He wasn't a member of the police chief responsible for the fatal accident.
The official expert opinion was prepared in case of a fatal accident caused by the Chapter of District XXII.
It may be said that he had been led here or in a state of accident from his post in the late 20th century by the police captain Morva Attila, who had been killed by a criminal, informed by the Chief Justice of the City of Morva Attila on Friday after having prepared his expert opinion on this matter.
The expert opinion supported the initial investigation result, which had already established that the former police chief had not used alcohol before he had been behind the camp.
On the road to Kossuth Lajos in the 21st century, the head of the capital of the capital of the 21st century, with his own personal head on the way to the streets of Kossuth Lajos, he kindly hired a 55-year-old man who did not want to cross the road to his destination.
(The latter, in view of the fact that the criminal has not passed the bell, on the basis of the law of the Christ, is not an easy situation, the car must also be given priority.)
The killer lost his life after being transferred to the hospital.
As a result of the incident, the local police officer asked him to take his post and ask him to make peace, according to the police report, because the case was so bad.
In the case, the Budapest New York Office is conducting an investigation.
Morva Attila also said that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigation's final proceedings from the beginning.
More than EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three, with a total of EUR 400 million, education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as a credit agreement supporting energy, have been signed in Budapest by Veres János Finance Minister and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, from which 100 million credit agreements have already been concluded by the parties, the now signed contract on the use of EUR 200 million above.
The education-related projects also provide financial funding to the 150 million Euro credit agreement.
The EIB has set up a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose, with the extension of the credit agreement to EUR 150 million later.
In the area of innovation, 50 million euro has been signed by the parties to the Debrecen Union's research development project.
The conversation also took place on the 4th meter.
It was agreed that when Hungary completes the details of the financing of the metrics with the EU, it is back to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to Veres János, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects with EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The EIB shall provide loans to EURIBOR with an eight-year period of duration and without any remaining costs.
Bulgaria EU Property Paradise
The development of Bulgarian real estate markets - the whole of Europe's attention to the country mentioned earlier.
What, where and who buy the EU's ever more expensive but quickly expensive market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most important destination of the Eastern European real estate is Bulgaria, with cheap apartments and seaports.
Among the mountains are the most beautiful areas of Bansko, Borovic, Pamproo and Vitosa, and Albena, the "Aranypart", the "Napospart", the ancient Szopol and Neszebár, but they are also looking for more in the area of Kavarna and the Baltics.
According to an analysis by Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will also attract investors - so Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and they will also buy more and more in the low-cost Russian environment.
The capital city, Sofia, has a high level of opportunities, the trade and office tasks promise the highest distortion.
Bulgaria is the best route to become one of the most popular European golf stadiums, so it will be the best destination for the other two years.
For this reason, the expected investors are already shopping in large numbers, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
Researchers say that buyers in Bulgaria are also obliged to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
There are also foot and cypress investors, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and the Siparadiques.
Foreign buyers can join three groups - says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The depositors or revised properties will be purchased at a price of between EUR 50 and EUR 100, or old houses destroyed for EUR 5-15, and will be rescinded.
They require good access and communication opportunities, important to a large city, business, and usually local doctor's presence.
The second category is the skirmisher (Bulgaria was listed for the first 10 German holiday destination in December).
The third group is set up by business target investors who buy in the hope of medium or long-term value increases.
The destruction of the capital property is ongoing, as the search continues to be stronger.
In the European Union, the largest in Bulgaria is the property, but in the last five years it has grown by 21 percent.
On the basis of the increase in the property, the rate of payments is higher.
Fodor and six hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister for Environment and Water Affairs, Fodor Gábor said that the experts would like to complete their meeting, and after the official opening, the negotiations will continue with the Ministers after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Uttitervre, which provides for efforts to reduce emissions by 2012.
There is a strong debate today between developed and developed countries.
The United States also pointed out that it is not currently willing to deal with accurate figures, although it is under the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 from 1990 onwards.
Another major question in the Conference is whether developed countries are undertaking a reduction in emissions, in addition to providing both material and technological assistance to vulnerable countries.
There was also agreement on aid to developing countries.
The support base provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by the 16 members of the Governing Council, expected to be read in the market and profit of the ENSZ Global Environmental Protection Fund (GEF).
Hungary 6 percent
On behalf of the Minister for Environment and Water Affairs, Fodor Gábor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the establishment of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is able to reduce 20 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, irrespective of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to undertake almost 30 per cent of the measures if the world's other major developed areas, or developing countries are also committed to meeting their responsibilities and capacities.
Fodor Gábor argued that in 1997, in all countries contributing to the Kyoto Protocol, 5.2 percent of the countries were set off for a reduction of 5.2%, while the EU - 15 other Member States then - a minimum of 8% were committed.
The 6 per cent greenhouse gas consumption of Hungary's obligation is equal to the period 1985-87 which will be carried out at home. - Recalls the Ministry of Defence's statement.
In fact, Balin has to be subject to a long-term international climate agreement within two years, and in particular its entry into force since 2012, in this case the reduction companies under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow the new international emission reduction system, which is needed by the IPCC, in the latest reports of the UNSZ Nobel Prize, and the international scientific bodies involved in climate change.
This reduction in emissions would cause delay and prevent an increase in the Earth average of 2 Celsius, resulting in more serious and irreversible consequences, according to scientists.
Welcome to YouTube and the British Chief of Staff
Iraq and Afghan actions are published by the British military units in the video department, with which they promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) first received it to YouTube: special features in Afghanistan have been on video since March 2006 from its anti-talibu actions - the BBC announced.
These items are checked by the air-conditioned air-conditioned camera, and then sent to London, where their homes are placed on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There have already been 139 attacks on the Internet by air soldiers, and more than 75 of them have been seen on the Internet.
The British Ministry of Defence, "defenceheadquatters", was registered in October 2007, and all Iraqis, all of Afghanistan's shares, have videos, while the British Department of the Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Peace Service (MNFI) have its own YouTube headquarters.
Entry into Afghanistan
According to the original purpose of the air carrier, he set up the videos with a burning purpose, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to know the real purpose of the military's foreign presence with the general community.
At the level of the propaganda published in this form, there is nothing in the form of traditional television and television broadcasts - the BBC's defence expert Gordon Mackenzie has also announced some political messages, however, because it is in its own form that it demonstrates the validity of the military actions committed by the government.
The Americans made games
Soldiers are also concerned that, in addition to well-designed, censored and censored video videos are also directed to the distributor, who, for example, observe the death of soldiers: the little representative, the "prioral" propaganda films are the same as the purest talk about losses, but they do not show the war's blood page.
On the other hand, the Iraqi and Afghan army has already released a number of videos on the Internet that have been prepared for live inputs, but the British army has only recently received them.
The Americans are in a little different, free downloadable America's Army with shooting games, in which the soldiers can jump into the skin in a multi-dimensional life simulation.
The award will be awarded by the ministries
The Minister for Labour Lamperth Monika does not seem to be sensitive: he will hold an annual salary for his employees who will be grateful for his work and coffee since 2007.
You have a ministry where life will be spent, and you will have a wonderful atmosphere in the hearts of officials.
Bully, Christmas music, concerts and vendettas - that's how power works.
They're ready for Christmas, and the government's office.
The largest regular ministry is a charming party in the defence meeting, but the HM is not expected to be a ministerial worker.
In Karácsonia, the children of the wounded soldiers receive a gift, the Missios Karacson is visiting the families of the military serving in foreign missions, but they also arrange for press reception.
It's just 25 million to the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NIF) and the Ministry of Economic and Social Affairs (GCM) shall be responsible for the other meetings.
The GKM budget is held in the Future House, totalling 4,320,000 foreclosures and is expected to receive three hundred guests from the sixth ministry.
At the festival, they will bow down to the golden calf, but they will also bow down and bow down.
The NFU prize was awarded at 4,700,000 Fort and was also held in the National Service Council (OIT) building.
The earthquake took a million forts, and more than a quarter of the invitations were spent on the top.
We know that one section of the IMF is also responsible for another Christmas event: this is a bidder company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre from the EU budget.
For the purpose, the building of the House of Commons was built.
The information was not reinforced by the MAG Zrt because we failed to achieve the mission.
You don't have to wear clothes
The ILO building not only visited the NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Management, which was held in Luca on 7 December.
They didn't ask for money for the use of ILO products.
Five hundred people took part in the wall.
The beer was started with the minister's thanks, and it could be dancing after dinner.
The [origo] question was made known: the ball was not binding on the night dress or clothing at all.
Puritan is in charge of health, work and government affairs.
The Ministry of Health organises art and ceremony in its own building for 400 000 workers.
However, the Minister for Labour, Lamperth Monika, is officially not a nobleman, but his employer is waiting for a year's job interview.
Hundreds of guests who have announced the press will only receive coffee and coffee, so the party will get out of 350,000 Fort.
The Minister of State of Bajani Gordon, however, will simply drive with his colleagues under the Ministry of State and Rural Development.
The Ministry of the Pensions (PM) has held a wonderful meeting at its own headquarters, with 436 workers waiting for it.
On Friday, 2,500 forts are for the Christmas party - in the amount of a protective reception and a coccintitary man.
As soon as Veres János is a minister, the PM workers celebrate each year.
But it will not be a Bullihangu, it will not only speak to the Minister, but also strengthen the date of the Day of Delutan.
On 20 January, the Land Operations Summit will be held, the Prime Minister's prize will remain.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyadvár, Városligt, and according to the announcement of the meeting, 1,000 forts for the hundred guests.
This, according to the press, will be a very simple adoption for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are responsible.
These are starting with a short-term ministerial meeting every year and ending with a recast.
At the same time, the Ministry of Education and Culture has not held a warm reception with the [origo] Department of Education and Culture.
The price of the official charity of the environmental business could not be disclosed to the press.
In all, more than four hundred people were invited to the pool that is held in the Museum of Art.
The forces of the Oriental Strands are at the top of one.
In Friday, the United Nations and the National Association of Workers shall be established to coordinate the weekly, decided-time strikes.
There is a large gathering of advocates on Saturday - on the day of the closure of the health insurance law - and the punishment begins.
The action will certainly result in a significant delay in transport, as it will take full control of road transport and will take 13 hours to cross the BKV.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Nations will know the details of the weekly events organised together with the National Association of Workers.
The LIGA-MOSZ is also responsible for coordinating weekly actions.
They hold a high-level meeting on Saturday, and from week to week, organisations connected to the streets are forced to work for an unlimited period of time if they can't reach agreement with the government.
This means that they have not marked the date of the end of the initial strikes on the day of the parliamentary vote on health insurance law.
If the National Assembly has not yet adopted the Health Insurance Act, the agencies shall immediately withdraw the call for asylum.
However, if the legislation is adopted, the Committees of the Regions shall meet and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the weekly schedule of the National Assembly, it is also possible to imagine that the health insurance law will only be voted in late evenings, if possible.
This can be calculated for significant delays due to the beginning of the week: the work on the train is delayed for an unlimited period of time, and a part of the population of Budapest can be stopped by more than half of the Volan states.
At the same time, the country's many points of departure will also be a journey.
A number of organisations and civil organisations have been added to the call for strike, which are constantly updated on the day of the League.
Some organizations have been in a state of emergency, others have been sentenced to temporary work.
Up to the south, the Free Trade Organisation (VDSZZZ) has not been able to stop enough services and is increasingly traveling along the way with the presence of Christmas celebrations.
From 13 hours from the beginning of the project, between 7 and 9 hours from the BKV, Budapest Airport, four strands are held by the LIGA Villamos and the Héernergia-Iipar Services, and 2-8 hours from the Pedagogues and the Pedagogues Democratic Office.
The Hungarian Medical Association has a two-way warning strategy for the Health and Social Sector for the SZEF in the country, which has changed in time.
The four requirements adopted by the League are the most important for the government to return the advance on health insurance reform and to forgive a new concept of social cohesion.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new method of calculating recovery from the coming year.
The third is to ensure the possibility of access to the system by 2010 by the end of this year.
The fourth reason for this action is that the Free Trade Organisation (VDSZZZ) of the Free Trade Organisation (VDSZ) of the Ministry of Economic and Social Affairs does not accept the offer of rail sources.
Political Capital: Magyar Garda raised the country's risk
With the support of the Mozgalom for Hungary this year, Hungary's Gárda activity in several respects also increased the political risk of Hungary and the region according to the Political Capital Risks Division (Rish Analysis Division).
The company's "risk warning" wrote that, in view of the Hungarian Guard activity, the most significant political risk is that "in view of the fact that there are still some strong ethnic differences between the Chinese and non-Cycian population of Hungary, there can be no more than a few times as far as strong ethnic alliances are concerned".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, in view of its policy strategy, led to the investigation.
As it was written, all Hungarian politicians can return to the top of their debate: "the public debate of the Roma has been handed over to representatives of radical and ambitious political groups who could build a policy strategy against the cycian-migrant".
This deepens the problem, prevents normal conversation, strengthens tensions, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research agency, the activity of Hungarian Guarda for the impact of major home and international media struggles "has significantly affected the foreign picture of Hungary, mainly with regard to the country's stability and democratic development".
It is recalled that since the year 2006, Hungary has been part of the reorganisation of more and more radical and volunteer groups that have received more publicity and membership than 2007 in Hungary, which have been called a "national self-defence" entity.
"The joint appeal of the munitions to define themselves as a civil body while their members openly declare themselves to be armed - for the protection of (catastrophobic, defence, regulation) responsibilities, according to the report of the police, the military, or the State's ineffectiveness" - was added.
It was noted that all of this is done in accordance with the manner in which the different political arrangements are made on the basis of the political and political opposition of society to civil affairs.
The importance of civilisation and the uniform form, therefore, is not limited to the rejection of the legal requirements of the Court of Justice in the case of these associations, but also in the political strategy.
According to the study, the activity of Hungarian Garda is also a risk factor for neighboring relations.
"In the last few months, several neighbouring countries have also turned to Hungary as a potential source of danger, and some neighbouring countries have sought to prove their own anti-English policies by referring to Hungary's Gárda's intervention.
Everyone can take the political stability of the area" - they did it.
According to the research institute, Hungary's Garda's recovery is not a unique feature in Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
As it was written, for example, the Hungarian Guard was operating for the Bulgarian National Guard, which announced its establishment in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the wake of the Bulgarian War, there are numerous Roman riots that occurred in one fourth of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
The BNU decided to use this to build a market, saying that the organization aims at "national protection".
In the past 17 years, we have said that in Bulgaria, there has been a "ciganyterror" in the same country, but the state has remained silent and in the middle - a reminder of the Political Capital.
They added: the issue of the initiative has changed in Bulgarian public.
As it was written, the increase in the risk of ethnic groups indicates that certain Bulgarian Roma organizations have reported that opposition is causing their own burden.
Since the Hungarian Guard's educational operation shows similarities with the operations of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not only possible for Hungarian Roma to respond to the threat of self-defence in the warning of the political capital risk.
Juhász Attila, the Political Capital Research Director, told the border office that the risk assessment was one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they shall issue their risk assessment every year and, if they have experience that may have an impact on the risk change, they shall inform the address as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is the red letter of the festival
In Hungary, the law clearly identifies the days of the red text and has already become a general practice around the holidays, which will be less than in the future.
There is no single event in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system differs from the national and state ceremony and the working day.
The working days are often due to church celebrations and significant historical events.
We invite you to celebrate the new year: the last and the first day of the new year, work with each other - and the last time just to get rid of yourself.
All year round, we have a total of twelve blue letters.
On 15 March and 23 October, the national anniversary of the 1848 anniversary of the 1848 anniversary of the revolution, also on the 1956 anniversary of the revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate our work on May 1, and on November 1, and on November 2, we remember our friends.
In addition, we have two days to celebrate the flesh, the puns and the Christmas.
Since our public, national or local religious holidays are rarely scheduled for the weekend, the day shift has been applied in cases where we were working only one day before or after the holy day.
Yes, the price of extended weekends is that we don't stay away from work school in previous weeks.
The Minister of Labour shall set out in a separate regulation for a period of years from the date immediately preceding or following the date of the meeting.
All workers and employees of the legislation shall be distributed to the workers, public servants and public servants.
However, it does not matter whether the operator and the organisation continue to operate in the working days, institutions, or agencies.
In this year, only about the end of the year will change your career: from December 24 to December, life in the country, as the experience has shown that the majority of people are "sustained", or used for this purpose for the sake of freedom.
In the future, we will have more meetings in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be less workdays than in the past.
First of all, it's about a day's holiday, and then all of a sudden, the workers will be at home for four days.
On Saturday, 26 April, he will be working to make a holiday on Friday, May 2.
Another translation is based on the 23rd of October: on 18 October, on Saturday, it will have to work on Friday instead of on 24th.
At the end of the year, however, the festival can be held in the future, as it is held at the rate of 24 December at all times, even if it is at the end of the silvester.
A six-to-a-threat that you can release your colleagues.
E-mails that we forgot to send, voicemails that we never get, innocent lies that we don't notice, they're "simply" every day at work.
Ask yourself whether you are aware of your own imperfections or take advantage of your treasure, and you are aware of the situations that can cause you to be dishonest to others.

"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you I was looking for a marketing class," says one of your colleagues.
So how did you stay out of a meeting?
In the best case, you are sorry and try to do the right thing, you may invite the marketing department to say that you forgot to deliver the message (not the least common solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get into Chinese surgery, it's good to think about what you can get to your colleagues for a few minutes, and be aware of how you can avoid it.
Are you buying something that's not yours?
There's no more excitement when you're late for a letter, an office, or your phone, and there's no room for it.
Remember that you put your fire machine on the table yesterday, but you had to walk in the morning?
Maybe you'll put some of your friends in writing about the loss you thought you'd lost?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking, because they'll be just angry at you to throw away your assets.
Don't get caught up in your office pockets, in your mail, because it can be uncomfortable if it takes time, and you'll need it right away.
Do you complain about your friend's experience?
There's no good way to stop the already-discovered plant.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not rely on your spouse’s feelings (debts) for your own good.
If one of them shares the most secrets with you, don't live with his trust.
In your own words, describe what is happening in each picture.
Do you mean the indocolated patient?
When you call the office and report to the head of the hearing, because your feelings are bad, or you feel that day is worse than that; think that your work, your work, your work, and your work will not be in vain, will have to be carried out by others.
Don't go out with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you're not going to go to the office next day, or you can get something you need to stay home for, make sure that your colleagues and your boss don't miss you the other day.
Respiratory, thoracic, thievery
Did you get involved in the job, but did it really make it hard for you to watch your peers?
Have you become an unsolicited fan of a phone conversation that would've been better off not to hear?
Do not interfere with your work habits, noise, loud talk (which you continue with above your head), or with walking, continuous injury, voice discomfort.
These may be obstacles, even if they are not actually deeply involved in one project (in writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If there's no time for it, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don't make any difference in your privacy.
Don't refer to a potentially ruling officer in the office, a sound colleague!
You know, if you've made a mistake, and that's what's behind you, and you're gonna get your ass out of here.
Ask me how you can make your mistake, put the blame on you.
Are you feeling too much at home at the office?
McDonald and popes: It's a nice ride home, but it's not in the office!
Then don't take a nice break if you're working.
Do not be lazy, your spouse, and respect yourself by wearing a weekend suit - if you ask for work, pretty, elegantly - go to the office!

Car racing in the usual morning shower.
There is something special about the radio: a loud voice that deals with electronic effects.
I'll make the sound better.
The music has become staged and the music of the past comes with the bass, and the female choir is connected as a real evening meal.
The number of Zagar Wings of Love on mr2.
The life of home music has not been very comfortable with a good quality electronic pop.
But now it looks like it's all different if you're listening to the new Zagar.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting production coming from the home digital basement has gradually changed in the form, and the missing tastes again the giraffe-like gas rock, and the home electropop shows: there's a new during the Day.
Judge Balázs was away from Pécs, and you played Yonderboi music while maybe because two songs didn't get into a closet - he went on his own trip.
With its project (Zagar), and with its music, which the jazz, electronic dances, the pop elements were five, but it started to break when movie soundtracks were asked to compile (e.g.
Drök Ferenc Szezon).
At the beginning of the small club, he knew more about the public when the first albums of the van2 magazine of 2002 were released among the five most important home albums, and he opened Zagar, Yonderboi's company, to those who seemed to be a single, easy-to-market trend.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his music became "trendi," but of course no one asked them if they were interested in having their notes.
The singer responded as you should: he made a new, better poem.
The Cannot Walk Fly Inserted album can now open new paths for us, even if you want to create the title continuity with the first five years.
It's the same Zzáser Balázs as a queer, an old singer.
We'd be in the air with the air, the air, but the sound of the music has now appeared - according to the spirit of the weather, according to the trend - the lighter guitar, the rock and roll effect.
In this article, the current song of The Puzzle with its singer, Ligeti György, was presented to him at the award of the Lemme Millenárisbeli.
The album also produced a true radio player, and since the next morning the popular music of the morning, mr2 Petöfi has started to pop into his mind with the six-home music "Underground Divas" set by Wings of Love.
It's all right, then.
Hvg.hu Zzáger Balázs asked.
hvg.hu: This new slogan now raises the question: how long have you been running what you're playing?
Judge Balázs: The determination to succeed is not too much for me.
I think there are two kinds of easy chains; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but business and honest.
The so-called alternative, ground music can also be lamatas, anything, and they can be prepared for the sale of waste, which makes them commercial.
But with a good pop, you can learn from the honest start.
The attitude of the receptionist is also working in this spirit regardless of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of English and foreign audiences in music?
Zs.B.: In other countries, there are more traditions of ease than ever before.
It's not just the ten-hundred-and-a-half-year-old korstala going to concerts, but the older ones.
Much more attention is being paid to the slight changes in their surroundings, as they are also part of court culture.
hvg.hu: What is the public role in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how much do they listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that they're getting more and more to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
We're looking for the music, not for the purpose of it, but for some kind of birth.
The role of the public is more sensitive to the concerts where the effect is already working on each other, but this is only happening at the moment's inexhaustible changes.
Still, I noticed that if you want to obey the public, you're no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How many plans do you plan to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's actually working, and he built his career more easily than we did.
Zs.B.: We're not really his path, regardless of how they sometimes try to explain it in our music.
We're more of a team of people who trust in the presence of other music and let it out.
Of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi's music, since more than one of his songs became part of his music and we moved on another way.
hvg.hu: The first place in the top of the mr2 Petófi is the Wings of Love.
Many of these numbers have first heard the name Zagar.
Did you know that you opened the most popular style on a brighter scale?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a slag, then we're going to sell it.
This part is about more.
We're on the album's finish line, trying to solve the music you've been asking for and the most difficult subjects.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why exactly did they-- what was the lead?
Zs.B.: The idea was to be a guillotine corus.
It was then that the idea was that this choir should be made up of a good voicelist at our own home music scene.
The sixth choir was joined by Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judy Jay, Peterfy Bori, Dodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - which was then known as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you design or made the girls?
Zs.B.: The number is in an instrument version that has existed for a long time, then when the substance was collected, we thought that this number should have something else to do with it.
He made my appointment so I could sing to him.
Even that night, I was able to put up with the division that the girls later learned.
At first stage, the whole thing came in spontaneously.
I remember, he was very alert in the aquarium, but of course they had to go to the Divák.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: All the faces, all the concerts seemed to be behind the girls.
There's no talking (except Judy Jay's short words), they don't have their own parts, they're all singing together and they don't sound like music, so music doesn't just try their songs.
They're back on the stage.
That's sweet?
Zs.B.: It was simply because of technical problems.
But it's known that we wouldn't have been able to divide our vocabulary.
The number also tells us to forget a little bit about where he came from, where he lives, just let those certain sources, the love of our ancestors.
I'd like others to feel the euphoric condition we felt when the part was born.
hvg.hu: What was most of the work?
Zs.B.: In fact, not one of them was actually in the music industry, but they were more difficult to play.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play in a contest, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work long enough, and then he was pretty good at everything in his place, like a basketball game.
hvg.hu: What are your favorite numbers about the new poem?
Zs.B.: This always changes with the concert and that I've already "let go" the poem.
Now the Prophet is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
The selling broker has risked billions of lives due to a feeling of low intensity.
It's unskilled.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociéte Generale Bank, was known as Jerome Kerviel.
He lost almost EUR 5 billion for the same cause as he was in July.
However, it seems that the impossible of Kerviel was more than just a big player who wanted to end up with his colleagues.
In contrast to other banks, he recognized the American market crisis.
"Slowly spiritual ability," he heard from police reporters.
However, according to the report by the French Le Monde, it is clear that in the last year, it has made EUR 1.6 billion of its profits.
It's not just America.
"I just wanted to find money for my bank," he claims.
He is currently looking for a half billion euro that has been successful in the US crisis.
He promised the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there are reports that problems will be caused by the low income or underprimary markers provided by the so-called sub-primary agents in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe this and did a good job.
Last year's profit was EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I was looking for the first half billionaire, I didn't know how to get in," Kerviel recognized and added that he had nothing to hold on to.
In his statement, he admitted that his reports had been faked so that he could not get out.
He managed to convince his bosses, even when he was interested in the business he had started in the Eurex prison.
The risk was beneficial
Did he say everything was out?
Not anymore.
"I thought it was just the fact that I've been looking for the bank for 1.6 billion, it's gonna calm them down."
How was his character so dangerous?
He's getting a lot of weight on his position.
He has been working at the General Bank of the Society since the completion of the Lyonian Union.
His annual salary was about $11 billion.
Two years later he was already a broker, and in 2005, he became a self-employed broker with $90 billion in payment in 2005.
He knew, however, that he would never find as many as others.
"In 2005, I knew during my first conversation that they were looking at me with a bad eye.
"For my finality, for my professional and personal development," Kerviel said to the investigators.
The first big success didn't come much after the entrance.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, it took about half a billion euros for the London bombings.
And that's what started the labyrinth. He wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a hero," he said to the police.
But their bosses probably knew about everything, or they'd got more of it.
"While I'm looking for money, my eyes are lost."
It's been a shock at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
One weekend he wanted to see her in mid-January.
When he went to work this week, he didn't work in the bank anymore.
And a few days later, the bank reported that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they get there?
He became suspicious of his freedom.
"Just four days ago.
The bloker who has no freedom, a bloke who doesn't want anyone to intervene in his reports," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic 365 billion potential for purchase
The Czech Government's ministers have signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion) in the coming years.
The total amount available from Belarus between 2007 and 2013 is above the total amount.
There are about 125 billion Koreans from the seven operational programmes in the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain 100 billion crowns from the Management and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, towards transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operating programme and 22 percent of the resources available from the foundations for Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the State base for the Transport Infrastructure, which will be financed by $90.8 billion in the future.
The Business and Innovation Programme will help businesses and companies to acquire innovative business tools.
Companies should also be provided with resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in achieving EU funding.
The ex-President of Nicaragua granted a fine of one hundred years' imprisonment
In 2003, Arnold Alemán, who had been sentenced to a hundred million dollars (about 1.8 billion dollars) for financial losses, was sentenced by the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal to a half-year prison sentence.
Later, however, he was released from prison and was living in a house - to - house prison near the capital.
The fact that this Central American country's former leader between 1997 and 2002 needs to be restored after generations is not clear, according to the AP Agency.
According to Ileana Perez, the President of the Court of Appeal, he will rely on the prison authorities to let Germany go into prison or return to prison.
Four years ago, the Court confirmed to Germany that government funds were regularly used for foreign companies in Panama.
These firm companies and their accounts were actually their clients and their closest supporters.
Some of these funds have been implemented on a number of basis, based on the financing of the 2001 German electoral campaign.
We lost our budget
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
What's the difference between this budget?
This is a budget without the support of a majority of coalitions set up by this first government.
This year's anniversary has even passed with the support of the Social Democrats, since the Minister of Sobotka and the Czech Social Democrat Part were unable to accept it.
There was no drama right now, in contrast with the issue of the government's uncertainty.
The representative of the House of Representatives has generally ignored this, even though it is the most influential law.
It's a certain opposition.
Every government will start and end on its own, whether it likes it or not.
The budget is a key element of policy, but the government and the opposition are behind the terrible wars.
It's more grateful in the media, so you get more attention in the media.
Politicians are more interested in the public than in empty numbers.
The Government of the People's Democratic People's Republic of the Congo has been struggling with three shortcomings in State budgets which the 2008 budget is unable to meet once:
The first of these is the high level of the law of trusts, which not only benefits but also social benefits, which are agreed by the "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM's silent "coalition" prior to the elections
Second, as a result of the first deficit, deficit growth is a consequence.
The third limit is the deficits of the central banks, i.e. the costs of cities and railways.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
This is under public and relative control.
The deficits in the budget of the cities and railways for the time-consuming bombs.
In addition to taxes, revenues and bank charges, many citizens have been able to obtain money for other investments, and they have often been obliged to pay off debts that have been sold by their citizens without charge.
In recent years, this has been achieved by the massive sales of the shares of energy and other distributions received from the State from privatizations.
Now they don't have such a source.
If we are only in favour of official and verifiable facts, we shall conclude that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for some years like the rest of the world, with the Czech Social Democrat Part.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to arrange public funding.
Instead, the country has been given more responsibility.
Other countries have been made more and more prosperous in Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, Czech Republic.
This is, first of all, the horrors of the former governments.
We belong to countries that are at a global level at the lowest risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for, for example, for strong social programmes, which have, in recent years, been highly geared to giant sizes.
Now that it has succeeded in eliminating some of the unreasonable populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if in the near future it is not possible to set the deadline for retirement and the reform of the pension, any policy in this country has really ended, and anyone in the government will be responsible for it.
A little overstatement can be said that the majority of the government's taxes are usually reimbursed and social benefits become mechanical distributions.
Therefore, it is not possible to translate the temporary budget, but only to stop the reduction of the regular expenditure entrusted.
The $70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely offset if the previous governments had not exhausted everything that could have been done in the last few years.
If we do not really want to make it difficult for empty offices to become politicians, we need to be patient and we need peace to prepare for further reform laws, not too strong, with a clean coalition government, so that the State can only pay as much as it can from taxes and property.
This only makes it possible to achieve a more balanced budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The Central Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the Great Britain, Sweden and Canada central banks have decided to fight the financial crisis together.
This is how money markets spend hundreds of millions of dollars in cash.
In these cases, banks increase the cost of spending money.
For example, the American Fed owes four billion dollars to your wallet and makes it accessible to the European and Swedish central bank.
Following the 12th attacks in September, it is now the first time that the central banks of some countries have established a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital, which banks could exchange," said Bernard Baumohl, a consultant from the Economic Outlook Group.
"The central banks' coordinated action in the United States has reduced the likelihood of recession to about 65 percent," Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already lost six billion dollars in the United States for non-refunded loans.
Researchers are still counting on billions of losses.
"Central banks can really keep track of what can happen even if they have decided on such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, president of ABN Amro.
Looks like it's really bad," he made it to her.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks are able to make it difficult for them to join their loans, they also give them to their customers in a more expensive way.
This would reduce the need and hinder the American economy with possible consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks then decided that it did not succeed. LibOR, a reduction in the low cost of the London bank supply, which is used for money laundering on the central bank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of the exchange of money, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had sometimes reduced their profits in the real process.
"This will have a similar effect on further camouflage," said the Reuters Agency Greg Salvaggio from the Tempus Consulting company.
Some analysts do not think that the central banks' action will contribute to the crisis, since it does not pose a basic problem, the collapse of the American real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' Unbelievable Vitas
Global climate change threatens the most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
The International Conference on Climate Change held by the ENSZ Balin has so far been criticised.
The book of names Cécs, not the green planet, presented in Becs, made the ecologists incredible.
Klaus says that not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is made up of a particular minority of governments and civil organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and the reality of this attempt.
"The adoption of the debate is absolutely without the structure, it's just a demonstration of words that can solve the current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the letter of the Czech President, he stressed that it was very important for him, and that is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book also appeared in German translation, because, as he said, "I'm often just meeting with my cartoons."
Therefore, interested parties can now read their unconfirmed opinion.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but he believes that he has sufficient grounds for writing such a book.
As you have experience in the statistics and advertising as a capable academic, you are also paying attention to professional advice.
At the end of the book, it was noted that climate change is constantly changing, i.e. normal, and that there is no consensus on the evolution of the planet that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, so they do not jeopardise the risk, and the costs of climate change are too high, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to refer uncertified opinions to others, which I feel as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He once again explained to the present questions that "the environment is not against fair protection, but against militaristic environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and uses."
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Becks two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 of these were unable to enforce their rights
A six-hundred-and-a-half-year driver was unable to break his old license at the end of the year.
This is the last day of the day, when they can still ask the court to be able to establish the new jurisdiction by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of passengers will travel after the year without valid rights.
According to the authorities, first of all, those who no longer want to lead.
While railways show a low interest rate for law enforcement officers, the main civil servants have been listed with questions relating to law enforcement officers which increased their interest this week.
There are approximately 2,000 employees in the Office of the High Commissioner today.
It's gonna take a half an hour to stop.
In Prague, about 14,000 passengers were not yet registered.
A new right-of-occupation lasts a few days.
However, the new legislation may also be required for a shorter period of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver will still have to pay plus five hundred crowns.
Vehicle operators who are unable to carry out their compulsory licence by the end of the year and who are not entitled to travel shall be subject to a penalty from January.
The criminal must pay a maximum of two crowns.
However, the police are also scheduled for the investigation.
In the case of an administrative discharge, the sentence shall be 2500 kroner.
On the basis of previous information received from the city, a court may also be held that does not travel anywhere.
He can usually pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously urged officials to be vigilant and to impose criminal penalties on them.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka, the Ministry of Transport's spokesman, no one is threatened by more than ten tribunals.
You think the lawyer is a law that people want to accept or not.
This is not a personal statement that must be valid for all of us.
Those who don't want to take the lead should be told about their rights.
It is sufficient to carry out or to proceed to the appropriate office by email.
By the end of the year, the rights issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, vehicle drivers need to be increasingly affected by the other type of authorisation.
For three more years, those who have been in possession of literature between 1994 and 2000.
The validity of the permits issued between 2001 and 2004 is only reached in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more chapters.
The Court reduced the prosecution of the investigators in Berdycc.
Josef Opava and Petr Kojörí were police officers who had been charged with David Berdich's crimes, ten hundred and ten years of imprisonment.
The Supreme Court of Justice has finally decided on this, which has reduced the penalties for one or more of them for two years.
The investigation of the pre-Serveded crime camp was originally a 14- and 12-year-old in prison.
It is no longer possible to intervene against today's decision. The review can only be requested by the Supreme Court.
Noha Berdyche is questioned at the same level in this case, but only the first sentence is expected.
In other procedures, he has been sentenced to more than 16 years.
You can't get it anymore.
In January, the Supreme Court found 19 people involved in criminal offences, including 16 of which were brought by the Supreme Court today.
The majority of the accused filed charges from the start of the investigation by stating that they were speculative.
According to the Central Korean Senate, the members of the police have seen criminals from police sources outside the Berdycche agreement with information, have hidden some rockets and have helped the band avoid criminal liability.
That's why the band gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opaván and Koyrík.
The charge is about the crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
First of all, it is about rapes that have suffered a lot of serious health damage, but it is also about the return of a gun that is not permitted to be used by a mediator.
Because the police found illegal weapons, explosives, lasers or machine guns during the investigation.
The gang, according to the charge, has collected tens of millions of crowns from the mines.
The band of a member of a gang was already legally recognized by the courts in this trial by Berdych and many others.
Other members of the Berdych environment also testify in other proceedings before the Court, some cases have not yet been brought before the Court.
The initial negotiations have still been avoided by Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in the country where they are awaiting a final decision in relation to the crimes against the Czech Republic.
Account for child breast cancer: 12 million
The rights of the injured families in children born to birth, Igor Veleba, 12 million Coronas suffer from the treatment of breast cancer, plus judicial expenses.
Mother's head is three million, her father's two million and her children's one million.
As a parent in the hospital, he spends over 200,000.
The hospital's legal representative, on the basis of his proposal to a friend of Ondréj Vale, did not understand one.
"We've repeated the follow-up, because it's too much," said Dostola after today's conversation.
"In order to give an opinion on the opposition, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We'll decide if there's any value to be used at all.
But let's keep our opinion that this will be able to measure everyone in hundreds," he stressed.
It is thought that the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč to four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the jablonov family wanted one million crowns every month until he named his own biological daughters.
He served as an expert judge on the basis of criminal proceedings conducted by Motol United Kingdom.
Children have suffered from a variety of mental and psychological disorders and depression, according to psychologists.
Men were better able to deal with the stress situation, even if they found themselves with a vision that they didn't stop their newborn.
Women are getting worse by updating the broken trauma and what's going on right now, you've gathered the contents in Vele.

The courts have still allowed a relatively low level of damage to the people, which has been calculated on the basis of a number of millions of ancient tables in a few hundred years, except in a case of a few million years.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valajsko
Bolek Polivka lost the moment he launched for the title of the kingdom of Valaisko.
According to the Ostrava court, he first used the name of some king, but the project worked with the team of Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the painting.
Polivka didn't take part in the negotiations today.
According to the legal representative, however, the case is probably not over and the client will be involved.
"The debate is that Mr. Harabiš and team Bolek Polivka live in popularity," said Polivka's lawyer after the press.
You think Valachi's queen's voices are the color comet in the mood.
This opinion is shared by Haribish.
"We've been after almost ten years.
The search for money and the finding of actions," he said.
You think life is all about money.
"Over the years it has been found that the project is successful and can win something from it.
They want to get out of our work," he told her.
Future business
According to the court, the name of some king was first used by Polivka in television.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohetý crowned him.
At that time, however, this did not depend on the establishment of a lasting kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš created a plan for the issue of certain roads.
The original educational action was a business and the coming business activities, followed by the creation of the Kingdom of Valaisko society.
By identifying and signing the name and name of Polivka agreed in 1997 on the roads, these property interests are shown in the form and presentation of the proposed model of the property.
Who's hiding him from the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš used the idea that Polivka had only used it to make it public.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka has certainly helped the Valachi kingdom project," said the judge.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was an intense Arab and team.
It continued its cooperation by 2000 when Haribish Polivka organized official co-ordination in Vsetin.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš have been raised, who have been tortured by "the chosen King of Boleslav."
In the kingdom, Jarmila Shulák was transferred to begin the leadership of Haribish as a queen.
After 2002, Polivka Harabiš and his companions submitted a case against the court, which the court has withdrawn today.
A fight planned by the Haribish might bring him to the throne and to the queen.
This war should be a new king.
He still didn't want the details and the date.
"We don't want anything to happen.
This should be something like the kingly procedure of Slovakia.
The king should be chosen for a specific time.
Mr. Polívka can also be briefed," said Haribish.
207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: different requirements
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
There are no specific characteristics, the quality of the change, the direction and the production of the goods can be identified in many ways.
But the market's already behind it, Peugeot 207 is actually better.
And the so-called SW truck goes on with another team, so I don't think it's going to be my turn to think better.
When I tested Peugeot 207 classic hackback, for example, I complained at the back seat of the head left.
This is the end of the complaint, because the truck's corrosion means that in this respect the two-metre high horizons are no longer suffering.
Fürgen in the World
I'm going through the inside as soon as I can, so I don't repeat myself many times.
It's quite a successful design, where I'm the only exception to the poor console.
Here, I would appreciate more designer inventions if the outside of the car is so elegant.
The meetings are comfortable, and there are already times when we're talking to a short part of the meeting or to a carpentry.
The website's guidance has also been significantly improved in respect of the 206 model.
As for the area, there is also a sense of increasing the size of carasseria.
After the truck, the head is missing a little place already mentioned.
Do not store this message in your home folder
This machine is the main one in the package.
I have to assess this very well accessible (and also thanks to the backrests that can be released) and a sharp area.
The empty spaces are equipped with containers that are ideal compromises.
There's no way, there's no way, there's more to it, and there's more to it, and there's more to it.
But let's stay on the ground for a while.
On the basis of these tables, 428 l is the basis of a higher average value in terms of competition.
However, in Czechoslovakia, there is no such class car - with the Scoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the product of the young boeslav new generation, then we find that the Peugeot is well below 52 litres.
This value is already critical in the case of foreign mining or the substitution of bacon.
But if I have to remove the positives, then I still have to mention the level completely equal to the bottom of the second line or the very low slope.
120 litres in four rows
Our usual test engine has been tested with a 1.6 l temperature of 88 kW, with four powerful, remote powered engines.
And the truth turns out to be so you should look at the percentage that leads to the family hackback.
It's quiet, it's a little consumption and it's a dog first.
If we compare each of the Scotland officials, who are six times as many as they would have been in his pockets, I'm just happy to do that.
Tell me the price.
Car prices aren't cheap.
We need to remember, however, that we have tested a car equipped with a very good internal area and a very good engine.
The four-wheeled alien engine of the car is still going for 329 900 Kč.
The vehicle starts with 410 990 Kč, which is already too many.
The test Premium equipment will be equipped with additional 80,000 Kč.
Unfortunately, we're still developing, our automatic climate, our automatic abbreviation, our back windows were also electrical removal...
So the car's going to 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but it's counting Fabia's extra equipment, and it's a very similar result.
So you don't stay behind like the March decision.
The successful integration of Slovak students into British schools
In British schools, there are more children in Eastern Europe who have become concerned about the further development of local school.
Eastern European integration is one of many obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases when violent disputes between immigrants and the children of their households have developed.
The problems related to the integration of Eastern European children are well illustrated in a North-West Centre where disputes between local and Slovak immigrants arise.
The gap between teachers and the bond between parents is also marked by parental attitudes.
The situation was so bad that in Chatham, a Slovak woman who had been arrested for ten years was taken into custody by the police.
The criminal protects himself from being hurt by the racist acts of his son.
The police had to take action after two 12-year-old girls were attacked by Slovak immigrants.
The girls were apparently arrested and beaten with male racist marks.
"When we were at home, a boy went to the bus station and started to buy us.
When I told him to leave this behind, with the teeth and the corners on our shoulders, he would open his back with his fist," the mother of the students of the Slovaks wrote down the most unpleasant case for The Times.
There's both sides of the complaint.
One of the local residents has identified issues relating to the struggle for survival for immigrants in Eastern Europe.
The above examples show that in British schools, there has been an increase in the gap between local and immigrants.
In Great Britain, 70 percent of the jobs are available in Slovak.
About 30 percent of Slovak students go to British schools.
Cuba's highest altitude in the Caribbean
It's actually the height of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you're waiting for, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right answer.
The orange and white particles, high waves, or sea, calmed like a seaman.
Palmafés and all of them include pizzet, pizzet or mammorous cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
You can find this whole and even more rich listing on the Caribbean Sea.
However, on a mountain you can find more, and this is Cuba, the largest and largest peak of the Great Antillas.
During the Spanish years, Cuba was the backbone of the U.S. games.
Columbus called the most beautiful place he's ever seen in human eyes.
It became a beautiful and attractive map, which the Spanish have been deployed and transported to Europe in America.
The American season is about to end.
The National Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the principals of the U.S. mafia, built because everything that was considered guilty in the United States (in the first place) was welcomed in Cuba and supported the treatment, happiness, prostitution.
They were among the guests, for example
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In the month of the construction of the tower houses, in the vast islands of the former 50th century, they carried their bicycles as a symbol of culture.
Ernest Hemingway bought a beer in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had his own jacket in Cojemar.
The Bodeguita del Medio falait is decorated with the signatures of American business stars and politicians.
What about today?
You can see the coastal Bodeguita side with your hand.
In any of the nice National Hotel's wishes, you'll have a cup of coffee.
And 50-year-olds of culture have been traveling to Havana today because the once exported children and children have already arrived in this cold and cold air.
At first, however, the oldest part of Havanna has been significantly damaged, although there is no other beautiful colonial memory than there is.
Other places are even worse than Trinidad.
In view of the fact that foreign transport is providing the necessary money, it has received a green path.
In the past decade, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varader, on Holguín, and on such mountains as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a unique sanctuary in the world, which is primarily valued by the stakeholders.
From their extended sessions, your sugarcane has been shipped into sugars with gas and motorcycles.
Motor parks have not been refurbished over the years, so they can be seen by operating machines that can only be seen in museums.
Where are we going?
Most of Cuba's visitors won't miss the most famous places.
So there's no need to write too much about Varader or Havenna.
Maybe we'll just remember that there's a museum in Hemingway's already mentioned, and whoever likes the writing doesn't have to quit visiting this museum.
One of the most important parts of the river is the port of Vinjales-Kuba.
She's a vegetarian.

The forest is a place where they may produce the best quality Cuban dome.
At the latest, some of the seafarers may be present when they visit.
Some may also find it interesting to find out that there was a breach of Captain Zeman's Chilean episode.
Trinidad
A city of Jewish origin, which was not built very much after the Spanish ice-colonization.
The slave trade and sugar trade brought fame and beauty.
The economy is a body that has been killed in the beauty and monumental beauty of a small city.
During the four centuries, nothing has changed in the early four centuries of early Spanish construction that has been significantly influenced by the late French enthusiasts.
The Escambray is so remote between the fall and the sea that there have not been any roads in the past 50th century that would have been linked to other parts of the country.
A certain silence helped to keep him out of the way.
Nothing was built there, so they didn't break down, everybody was happy that he's on his head.
If a person has more time than a south-east to Trinidad, he will be able to look at the interesting places around him, such as the Playa Ancón party, or the Cook Islands.
And this is like going to the Casa de la Musica, where you'll see it after the darkness, where the music just sat down in the morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities in the eastern part of Cuba are located in the largest.
I'm sure this opinion will affect you.
Both Guantanamo roads have to cross high and narrow mountains, leading to the very nature of human activity.
Cuba's original landline was added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO, thanks to the unusual nature of the Atlantic Ocean.
Here is the best chocolate in the church, the Columbus cross (in fact it was prepared hundreds of years after the ship Columbus) and the dombrole, where the El Castillo Hotel is located and today, some of the most popular tables are El Yunque.

The way they say it's right, it's better to see it once.
Afghanistan's alliances pass, US stands for
A small army and the lack of necessary equipment also affect the mission of the United States of Afghanistan.
According to Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should adopt specific plans for the following years.
The Afghan mission is not acting on the assumption that the leaders of those countries were in the Scottish Edinburgh, which have unity in the southern part of the country.
In addition to increasing opposition to the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries also advise on the further plans and coordination of the alliances.
While the United States Minister for Defence Robert Gates has been actively active this week, NATO teams, Great Britain, are considered to be the key to strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance.
"Afgani's development can be seen, but the military force can only be part of the solution.
The rest of the population will allow you to start further economic and security development," BBC Minister of Defence Des Browne said.
Ninety-one percent
The activity of Afghan risers according to US government data has been stronger in the last five years.
The number of violent acts over the past year increased by 27 percent and by 60 percent in the southern Helmand region.
NATO has approximately 40 million soldiers in Afghanistan, mostly one of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, the alliances also reached the limits in the organization and equipment of the teams.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were requested to be joined by Afghan teams.
"We need to think seriously about the specific objectives for the future and ways of reaching them," said Gates.
He spoke at the same time today about Jaap de Hope, the NATO chief.
"I don't like what is in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
Around nine percent of the soldiers are equipped with what we need, and this is small," said the Reuters News Agency De Hope at the end of a three-day discussion with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Ki Passive
In recent months, there has been controversy among participating countries, whether or not it is possible to give the maximum amount in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for passing.
"The Germans are on a very large scale in Afghanistan today.
However, they were captured in areas where the minimum force and military requirements are not as high as they are in the south and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The Sun Brit's bubble was named after the German soldiers this week.
"The Afghan days were celebrated: the Germans played until our sons fought," the Sun wrote in a photo of the German soldiers playing the table.
The German Bild was attacked and a British team posted a photo of the Red Cross in the southern part of Afghanistan.
In 2009 the Union will issue a single currency
It's a total of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion dollars by the end of September.
The government plans to buy 159.2 billion crowns in exchange for this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry has reduced this plan by 152.8 billion korona, thanks to better development of the state budget.
By the end of September, the Czech Republic had reached 842.7 billion crowns.
During the next nine months of the year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, since June it has been reduced by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of the Pensions has thus verified the official data of October's accession.
In each of the 44,000 crowns, more debts are involved.
The government has paid more than 11 billion dollars a year.
"Firstly it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit of the next year, we would only be able to reach the level of the single currency in 2009.
In the next year, the debt will move around 900 billion and a billion crown," said the iHNed.cz server of the Patria Finance analyst, David Marek.
Similarly, you can see this Next Finance analyser, Vladimir Pikoro: "In 2009 we can get through a billion transition.
That exactly when it comes to the next unknown budget.
If you were to prove that the situation would change in the policy area, politicians would be more likely to be more confident, this could be solved by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Upgrading responsibilities
Nationality is the central government's responsibility, which is primarily responsible for the death of government budget deficits.
Nationality shall be financed by financial notes, public loans, direct loans, or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
The domestic sales of the State increased by 38,5 billion to 719,4 billion kroner this year.
The foreign debt of the State increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroner.
By the end of September, the so-called arable holding had reduced 803.3 billion kroner and 13.7 billion kroner since June.
The average incidence of pregnancy increased by 6.5 years.
"In the middle of the year, the debt increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is actually enough to sustain the economy.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by the costs, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that a woman is responsible, but on the other hand, it shows why she's going to work when the pension reform comes here," Piko said.
Better than expected
It is clear from the financing strategy and from the 2007 government's management that the government has planned to buy 159.2 billion kroner in exchange for 2007.
However, by the beginning of December, the Ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion korona, thanks to better development of the State budget.
The amount is primarily due to the deficit of the State budget, which is likely to cover the estimated 91.3 billion kroner instead of the 76 billion kroner.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency is planning a maximum of 13.3 billion kroner resources, ten billion in cash payments, 43 billion in government loans in cash, and 1.8 billion in exchange for loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher today stands before a Cartoon Court because of the name of a filmmaker
A court hearing in Sudan sentenced the British teacher to 15 days ’ imprisonment and expulsion from the country because of the loss of Islam.
The British woman was accused of allowing 6-7-year-old students to name a plastic mace called Mohamed.
Such action may be punishable by a criminal offence.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was a teacher of the Cartoon Union High School, was detained on Sunday in her own apartment. Under paragraph 125 of the Swedish Criminal Code, she was accused of having been beaten and tortured after her parents repeatedly appealed to the Swedish Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked 6-7 years of students to choose the name of the class's plasma.
"The children were all proposed eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed," for example the school director, Robert Boulos.
At the end of the 23rd vote, 20 children chose the name Mohammed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of Islam's prophet, but he is a very common Christian name in Sudan.
The kids then made a day together with his maco photo and "My name is Mohamed."
You didn't make a mark on your macra with that name, but the problem is that any description of the prophet is like the loss of my tongue.
Gillian Gibbons, one of his fellow students at the same school, said that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything that would mean any religious conviction.
The teacher's many teachers agree with this opinion, and we think that the teacher is "very bad with children" and "never talks about religion in the class."
Let's not forget that the second most famous Christian name is Mohamed Great-British, and there are 14 different ways of writing in English.
This is one way of expressing respect for the prophet’s name, which is often chosen by the Muslim families. (The family’s first-born child, Gakran.)
But what are the rules regarding the use of the Christian name?
Can you get this name, for example, a game?
This is obviously a question of understanding.
There was no agreement on the future status of the substance during the last Friday of the week.
The conclusion: fuck.
In the morning, the talks between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians will be held in the near future on the status of the separatist province in Baden, Austria.
"Unfortunately, the parties did not agree on the status," said Wolfgang Ischinger, EU diplomat, in a press release.
The U.S. High Commissioner, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "risking danger", and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep the promises of peace and dialogue after negotiations.
"We don't have to keep strength in the near future, but we're going through very difficult times" - he added, stressing the "responsive nature of the phenomena."
Done at Brussels, 10 December.
Last week he visited Serbia and Kosovo the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
The future of the Albanian population in the 90th century can be cleaned up after Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator, Aleksandr Bocan-Harcsenko, submits a report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
Close to Bécs, the conversation in Baden announced that the negotiations would be effective and in one last session, since the ENSZ agreed on a new communication in August.
The US and Europeans believe that our mediation tasks will be completed on 10 December.
Russians who have already been charged with the independence of Kosovo in the Security Council have also argued that negotiations will continue after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was committed to Russia and will remain the negotiating solution with the compromise," said Bocan-Harcsenko.
A declaration of independence?
After 8 years in Kosovo under the leadership of the ENS, the minority authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was willing to comment on her independence if the Security Council did not decide for her.
Belgrade would still support the greatest autonomy.
"We have not been able to reach agreement" - the Kosovo independent president, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden Hotel, where "the last opportunity talks" have continued for weeks.
Hashim Thaci, a former Commander of the Kosovo Summit and Deputy Prime Minister, expressed his regret.
He added, however, that the idea of Belgrade's autonomy "would be a long history of murder and deportation".
Domain-Effects
Serbian President Boris Tadic said that compromise is still possible and warned the majority of Kosovo's citizens about the consequences of the unilateral rejection of independence.
Belgrade is still in an unstable area because of the twenty-first years of independence.
"This does not close the possibility of compromise for Serbia," Tadic said.
The Serbian delegation also reiterated that the decision would only be the Security Council, where the Russian Federation had a valid right to it.
"The Kosovo Parliament will be the last word"
"Serbia can only accept a solution approved by the Security Council" - Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"The negotiations lasted two years.
They must reach the same end where they started in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu announced to the press that "the Kosovo Parliament will be the last word". He added that independence from the Albanians is the only way to express independence on the basis of "attachment" on the basis of modern powers.
Bush's urgent agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush welcomed the opening of the International Peace Conference held in Annapolis in Maryland, and announced that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbaz agreed that they would begin a series of ongoing negotiations between their people for 60 years.
Bush, the two Presidents, has promised to support them in every possible way in 2008 to sign the "record".
In time, Palestinians had to count on "terrorist networks", and Israel had to quit their manufacturing activities - reported Bush, and reminded both sides of the commitments made in 2003.
The leader of the White House stressed that Abbaz led the Palestinian Authority and Israel's negotiations aimed at "a signature of a peace agreement, which addresses all issues, including central issues".
These are the last three easy issues facing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the Arab remnants who lived in the territory of the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
After the American President, Abbaz also urged future negotiations to be "global and lasting", and to understand the whole area of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, exile, countries, colonies, water and security".
Then Olmert, who has taken the lead, promised that future negotiations will "be flexible and ongoing", and he will be forced to "come to an end in 2008.
By the end of 2008, Bush set fire to the implementation of the Palestinian and Israeli "two-State visas".
Saudi Arabia declared that he had received a promise from Bush before he had refused to participate in the conference.
With the support of all the Arab countries, with the support of Saudi Arabia (which has been a success in the country) it has launched a plan guaranteeing Israel's peace when it comes to all the Arab territories occupied in the 1967 war, including the Kelet-Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is elected in the history of the Middle East, especially because of the problem of your race and focussing on the central issues," says the Swedish priest in his interview with the Saudi Arab daily.
According to the judge, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Friday?
As is usually the case with such signs, the official position and speech are against each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first investigation conducted by the National Police Authority (IGPN), on Friday, 17 minutes after the first day of the investigation, a police officer was sent to the village of Louise-Michel on the road to Williers-le-Beel.
"The driver drove, so he didn't take part in the action. 40-50 km/h, without checking," we knew from the police source.
The two-six-six-six-six-six-six-speeded green, "not included in the official declaration, so can't be used in road traffic" (see below) with Kawasaki brand engine.
"Because they didn't comply with the rules, the engine hit the police's left side," said one police officer.
The result of the alcohol test performed on the vehicle was negative.
It's good to show the gravity of the landing that the start of the car is infused, the winged star is in motion, and the pilot is in a state of shock.
In his statement of Wednesday morning, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that IGPN and Val-D'Oise were entrusted with the investigation initiated by the Ministry of Security of the United States of America, which was "on the grounds of the lack of human integrity and assistance".
In the course of the day, the prosecutor informed him that the police's responsibility could be eliminated in the current phase of the IGPN investigation.
According to the prosecutor, the three suspects who heard the accident on Friday night confirmed "the number of police officers, according to which the robot suddenly arrived from the police side".
The day of the day, from a moment on which the passengers were twice on the road, they showed that the two vehicles had been assembled and sent together once again until the police were unable to stop.
Vehicles were taken for technical examination.
On the death of the two victims, a medical examination was conducted last night.
What happened immediately then?
Last night, Williers-le-Bel-Bel spoke, which said the police quickly withdrew from the scene without helping the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN is careful, but notes that the police would have followed "any serious mistake".
"This is the most extensive part of the investigation, which is still under investigation and requires increased caution" - we know from the police source.
Liberation met with a blind man who counted a few minutes after the accident.
One of his apartment's windows is looking right at the scene.
"My cousin, who's a hospital nurse, we'll be quick to try to rebuild them" - for example.
"But we couldn't do anything."
Then he noticed "a police officer who was completely disturbed and injured.
The other two tried to restore one of the young, and the fourth was on the phone."
In the meantime, the trend has increased, as the two young desperate situations have become apparent, so the coming police have transported their colleagues out of the scene.
At the point of viewing, we know that the doctor has arrived about 20 minutes after the police were removed.
They've been used for hundreds of years, but it's not.
"I'm not saying that the police didn't try to help young people.
Young people have been helped in their own way.
The firemen came to the scene right away.
They've done everything to save them" - the prosecutor stressed.
Female Birth in Pakistan
On Sunday, the Pakistani police stopped the first attacks on the situation that were introduced by the Musaraf team two days earlier.
It is estimated that in the eastern part of the country, approximately two times in Lahore, there has been an attack against the measures introduced during the time of the need for a Member State against the aid bombs used by the regulatory forces.
They were followed by an answer to the police officers who were more injured.
At least 350 lawyers were made.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and burned them.
More people were created.
In his letter, the Supreme Court referred to the general districts of defence recorded by the General Court and reported complaints about arrests by approximately 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers during the week.
In order to prevent the assembly from going to the Supreme Court on Monday morning, they closed the doors.
In the central part of the country, there were more attacks in Multan and in the northern Peshawar.
Since the week, the lawyer's movement has also been supported by the strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal Association, which corrupts religious parties. "But the leader urged the people to send flowers to those who do not understand the need and to those who did so before Musarraf."
"The Moseraf promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned with the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
On 6 October, the Court shall declare the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from his dignity and was replaced by another.
"Mindaz, who we are witnesses, is illegal, unlawful and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," declared the president in the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he would leave the army for the purpose of entering the civilian president's office was "lost of his consent" after the meeting was introduced - he informed the Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem.
As of 15 November, the first president's mandate was to be elected from the military unit.
The Ministry of Information also confirmed the report on the postponement of January's elections.
On the other hand, the Pakistani Government has discussed the country's wide-ranging speech, which would have indicated that the President of Musaraf was a member of the Council.
No more than one third of the commitments are planned
This result is not desired (24%), nor is it intended to include unplanned or unplanned difficulties.
Even today, more than one third (36%) of the burdens have not been planned - it is said that four years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, the French National Demographic Institute (Ined) has approved adoption.
This result is not desired (24%), nor is it intended to include unplanned or unplanned difficulties.
According to Ined estimates, different methods of absorption such as the tablet or myspire are still in poor conditions in 5-6%.
However, according to the Authority, the liberalisation of adoption was more effective than the "birth regulation". The study notes that between 20 and 44 years of age, only 5% of women had been given the tablet, but this rate has already been 60%.
They're already planning 8 out of 10 pregnancys today.
Every fifteen months plan exactly, and if possible, you know, because this is the most challenging year for the child's adoption.
Visual improvement on the radio
Scott Parazynski had to work for more than seven hours on the brain in order to carry out a scientific improvement without delay in the scientific activity of the institution.
This dangerous lighting was also documented in several ways: the improvement lasted too long, it was very short to plan, and it had to be carried out with "barked" plates from the rooms.
The problem was well reported when the astronomers moved from Discovery to the Harmony. This is an element of the awful wind that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see the requested section).
This module is currently being transferred to the laboratory mode.
However, we need to take care of our prices.
The second task of the facility was, therefore, to move to the final location of an electrical price which was already in the ISS with 17.5 tonnes of paperboards.
Then the facility began to open the module’s 76 meters wide schedules.
One of the tablets, which could be combined in harmony, was then divided into one of them in a round cable of approximately 1 meter long.
In order to avoid further injury, the opening of the table was not continued.
The pilots originally had the responsibility of making a check-in route from Discovery's helicopter, and then modifying a different, dedicated travel schedule. Instead, they had to spend their entire time improving the damaged logboard.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to carry out the demonstration on his 30-metre robot car, which was strengthened by the trainer's stand.
He's one of NASA's best "smokers".
There's a strong, powerful, well-informed, very high-end and long-term career.
Therefore, a 46-year-old doctor had to "megoperate" the "crazed" calendar.
After thoroughly measuring the damage, he took the wrong cable, and with some "sin" he fixed the damaged area.
In his work he also helped another "scraper" who stayed close to the safe transition, and from inside the rest of the city, including the captain of the facility, Peggy Whitson.
The device used by it, a mini xyibot, which was seen with a rise in the frequency of several hundred tablets, the station’s cells were formed and "barked" together.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his friends opened the table completely, and then he packed all his belongings and returned to the station.
On Monday morning, the guards kept half a day's rest, and today they returned to Discovery's helicopter to start their planned return home.
Reduce the price of EADS shares
The price of EADS shares in the Paris airport was high after the company in charge of aircraft and defence equipment announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% reduction.
The company was obliged to review its forecasts for the 2007 performance, as A400M engine is about to be developed, which is why it is clear that the aircraft is being deployed later.
The delay in the deployment of the air carrier, which was reported in October, will take place between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, from which more than 1 billion is concerned by Airbust' - the mother of the European EADS manufacturer.
As a result of the disclosure of these expenditure, the EADS should publish new plans to the future cuts for the 2007 performance, when the results of the four-year report were submitted to the company, but no further figures were published.
The company group also indicated that it took into account the deadline for the preparation of the new cost assessment.
In 2006, the EADS business result was reduced by 86%: this was largely another programme, which contributed to the development of A380, which could lead to a large financial impact on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer A400M aircraft to the French soldiers in October 2009.
Change status to (date)
There is no great surprise in the summer elections: the vast majority of Russians will vote for the party of Putyin, Russia.
In this case, the need for stability, self-government, is shown after a highly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before parliamentary elections, Russian President Vlagyimir Putyin, Russian state, has a television message to the voters that have already been set, but the content is still confidential.
Putyin leads the Kremlin Support Party, a list of Russia's symbols, which is expected to show the first victory in the elections.
At the time of the adoption of foreign capital yesterday, there was nothing wrong with the conduct of the State: he had set up a more recent quirohana against the interference of the developing countries, which was his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know what price is for true democracy, so that's why we want absolutely transparent and open elections without any legal reason."
The opposition says I've never seen this situation before.
The opposition is spreading the campaign, which we say the voters are under pressure.
The Communist Party leader Gennagyij Zjuganov argues that "there was no such violent election in Russia even in the time of Jelcin".
After the release of the last week's detentions, the former army officer, Garri Kasparov, was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized detention, and his lawyer's arrest is still not visible.
"The Russians still think of as "homo Sovietus"
The quantifiable selection results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's after Puty in the state headquarters?
In the Official Journal yesterday, the date of the first roll-over of the election, which will be 2 March 2008, was announced and the markings can be indicated by 23 December.
Since Vlagymir Putyint was elected in 2000 and 2004, its mandate is no longer extended.
But there's no way to see you later.
- What role does Putin play since March?
Will you be a Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the Presidency as leaders of all possible parts of the United Kingdom, or as leaders of the majority of Parliament?
In any event, the removal of power will triumph in both Parliament and in the presidential elections.
This has become an excuse for me.
"The Russians are still thinking of the 'homo Sovietus' method: they don't feel like they can direct the races," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Nykolai Koposzov, the history of the St. Petersburg Union is even more different: it is thought that the country has become a Christian over five hundred years later, so it is too late for civil society to develop.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutyin returns to the pattern of patriotism, which has been perfectly achieved by the people. More than that, because this new patentism has not been celebrated, but has been accompanied by some kind of economic well-being," says Maria Lipman, the founder of Carnegie Foundation.
In our day the Russians are "tossing their personal responsibility" which was soon shown after the Soviets were destroyed.
"Why should we think?"
The importance of society is of interest to all parts of society, even to the business world.
The administration was interested in maintaining the current situation: the United Kingdom's local lists of 65 government leaders from 85 Russian regional leaders.
Freedom imported from Hungary often testifies to the consequences, as it happened in the 1990s.
The Communication shall take part in the stability process.
In this spirit the Russians also vote in favour of hostile parties.
Tamara Cseredniksenko, 54-year-old teacher, says: "Why should we think?
The powerful are not so bad, why should we destroy them?"
Explosive Memory
More than 60 years after the secretion, my Bad Arolsen archive, which document the fate of 17 and half million victims of the Hitler regime, became public.
The 47 million archive documents, which were taken 27 kilometres long in Bad Arolsen, the Hessen province, were still researchable for "human" purposes, provided only a unique and unique view of the victims or their victims.
In May 2006, ten countries to be managed - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - joined researchers and historians to open my archives.
After all the States ratified the Convention, the archives were opened on Monday.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The opening of Bad Arolsen's letter makes it possible for historians to carry out research "in relation to the transfer of infected people, the living conditions of the camps and the health of the disabled" - Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross.
To date, several countries, including Germany, have also opposed the public content of the texts, as they also contain names and thus provide reliable information.
For example, this may be the homosexuality or spirituality of certain deported victims.
The records of the concentration camps and the detention orders issued by the Gestapo were collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to investigate civilians who were deported or sentenced to forced labor, and possibly to provide evidence of their detentions, which could be contributed to damage.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in the processing of the ten individual needs.
However, a part of the scientific community does not hold the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive of great importance.
"These documents do not contain any novelty," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism in Berlin in 2006.
The EU-India Free Trade Agreement will be signed in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade has now reached a annual level of EUR 60 billion.
The EU is the first trade partner in India and gives 18% of foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope that they can sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008 - Peter Mandelson signed the European Trade Safety and Kamal Nath Indian Trade Minister.
In April, EU Foreign Ministers agreed that the European Commission should start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual trade in Indian bilateral trade is now close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is the first trade partner in India and gives 18% of foreign trade.
In addition, the EU is India's main foreign investor, but India is the EU's only 9th trading partner according to the European Commission's figures.
Peter Mandelson concluded that "a free trade agreement can have an economic impact on both parties," and "India could thus increase its presence on a market of 450 million inhabitants".
The first or second import of the ten most important products exported by India to Europe - has contributed to the European security. The two rice, Europe and Asia have "47 billion euro products" and "10 billion euro services" each year - announced the week's Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi. He also expressed his regret that bilateral trade " still does not fully understand its potential" in New Delhi and New Delhi.

Choose your concerns: the Bank of England offers 10 billion pounds of money for the five-week football game
The Bank of England would like to ease the disparity of credit conditions, so it announced to the Council that 10 billion English pounds are pumped into the money market, which is made available by 5.75% of the basics and by the general public at this time with five weeks of running time.
"We would like to ease the concerns that the financial market conditions are particularly bad at the end of the year, especially if banks could plan their liquidity positions for this period in greater security, which is why the Bank's holdings are a significant part of an open market operation in the international financial market from 6 December to 6 December".
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be made on the market on December 6, at 12:15 p.m. on local time. The offer will be valid for my bank base and the refund deadline will be 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England spends five weeks paying off liquid funds in the context of open-market operations.
It's usually a week's ride of such operations.
The Bank of England added to its press release that "he also intends to take further measures" in order to ensure that the central bank’s trusts are based on the bank’s record.
The current central bank rate was 5,829%.
The three-month period was up at the rate of 18 September: at the present rate of 6.6%.
Since the start of the cash market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant amount of money marketed, which has resulted in the loss of banks from the acquisition of these funds.
According to the speaker, (which only strengthens the value of the source flow to the euro) they would have been much more pleased with the resources approved by the European Central Bank, which would have been able to contribute to better weight and greater dyscretion.
The UMP and the NC will not hesitate to examine the socialist proposal relating to the buyer
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group have been asked to examine the socialist legislation articles relating to the buyer's power, which are equivalent to the rejection of the text.
The meeting initiated by the socialists included about ten measures that the national authorities of the socialist party welcomed, including 50 % increase in employment rates, the return of variable workers, the introduction of travel checks and the limitation of foreign charges.
Since the UMP and the NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the government party and the opposition finally spoke out in live voices. It was only a few hours before a television interview with President Nicolas Sarkozy.
The leader of the socialist mission, Jean-Marc Ayraut, announced that he would re-submitted all proposals to the group in order to amend the appropriate financial legislation, which will be submitted to the National Assembly's agenda next week.
They're born in a new festival
A number of languages were spoken by C3 Presents in connection with a new philadelphiic festival. However, the event was announced by the company that Melvin Benn Brit producer, in cooperation with the Festival Republic, is organized in New Jersey.
"It's a compliment to us that we work with a man who is the founder of today's American festivals," declared Billboard.com by Charlie Jones from C3.
The C3 organises the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits music festival.
New Jersey's party is held on Friday, so it's going to be a way to get a seat.
The festival is held between August 8 and 10, in 500 private areas of about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival Republic, former known as Mean Fiddler, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he started an organization with the British Reading Festival, which takes about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded his palace with the organisation of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 he invited the Festival Republic to live in the Latitude Festival in the Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a partner in the production, licensing and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival. This festival is now able to accommodate 177,500 people.
The C3 worker, Charlie Jones of Glastonbury Festival, called the "most influential event" that he once participated in. He added that the company and Melvin Benn are working together to finance the region with a European style festival.
"We've already selected the Phillydelfian location and worked hard together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to organize this in the center of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We have continued to deal with the city, and the Commission has shown great concern for our plan.
Sadly, however, because of the political leadership of the city, the organization has been filled with corruption," continued Charlie Jones.
" Luckily, we could talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we're preparing to organize a huge festival in another isolated location, where we're going to serve the interests of the Philadelphia residents for the last time."
The C3 Presents held a new life in 2005 in Lollapalooza in the Chiangoo Grant Park, after proving its outstanding character in 2002 by the Austin City Limits Festival.
The gross introduction of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million or 11.3 million dollars.
Both festivals were held at the city scene.
"Melvin Benn's European concept at the rural festival while our festivals are regularly in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to bring together the two models in some way, and this is the European foreign currency, and we are creating a city life experience in America."
It is located around half a mile between the Netherlands Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's residence, you're also the mayor of the city who strongly supports the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although it does not refer to the details of the agreement, it is concluded that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in an actual order to be made in a location where the festival is expected to be given over a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "serious" and will reflect the capacity of 80,000 main fans of the tennis Bonnaroo festival.
The associations have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is to be done at the time of the investigation.
"Vineland's going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a different music offer to find everyone who likes it," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, are engaged in the C3 company, which the latest Billboard Touring Awardson received the recognition of "the best independent organization".
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to get Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to compete with the Terminator...
The "recovery" is part of the mission sent to the show.
The mission is "politically difficult" because the California government, Arnold Schwarzenegger, opposes the export of its own production abroad.
Is it really hard to start a fight with the Terminator Government?
"We need to be careful because the filmmaker decides which of the best places for you.
If you find out that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our task is to provide the best possible conditions that we have decided on the basis of our decision," Schwarzenegger says.
Competition for festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now more focused on expanding Canadian films.
The same competition for Oscarok started.
The aim of the presentation and dissemination of more Quebec film at all American Film Festivals is to be both the Sundance Film Festival and the Demerer, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
L'Ége des December was a few weeks in a favorite film hosted at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
The Palm Springs International Festival will also be held in January.
The Shake Hands with the Devil film is presented in Santa Monica, and on November 30th at the Starz Denver Film Festival.
Québec also represented himself with four short films and four games this month at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will the year end of the rally on the throne be shared by experts?
Nearly five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already drawing up the fields and are almost waiting for the end of the ordinary year.
However, this does not make it clear to experts that this is really going to happen.
According to Banif, "statistics are generally positive in December.
However, the only statistical background forecasts are not necessarily located, in fact, in the current situation, the uncertainty of the market is at least short-lived."
Experts have previously shared the findings of the end of the 20th year, although they say that "the wholesale market is based on the present character of liquidity, this is an opportunity for investment because there are no alternatives to the guarantee, especially the fixed imports, which have negative effects on the disposal of quality securities, as long as it is short-term".
Thus, we say that there will be no movement from the top side of the continent, no movement of vololitism, "mainly because the effect of the reduction of Fed-kamatlab is unknown at first, the price of winsole is the same high and the threat of inflation".
Javier Barrio, the BPI's sales responsibility in Spain is consistent with this, so it would be dangerous to state that it will be rally.
According to the expert, "the situation doesn't always get worse."
The loss of Ibex is approximately 4 percent equal to the highest values recorded on 8 November when the index is closed at 15.945.7 points.
In spite of everything, not all experts are so powerful.
Juan Solana, the Intermoney analysis shows that Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16,000 points because of the organisation of the exchanges and the payments to the usual pension fund.
In this case, the expert adds that there may be some changes here, since the second week of December, after a long week of application of the Constitution.
The analyser is unlikely to influence market trends in voltilisation.
Federico Olucha, an analysis by the Inversis Banco, says that we are close to the technical level and that "so we can experience the return of the index, which can also increase the impact of the US news on the consequences of credit market developments".
The examiner trusts them to be favorites.
The analysts agree on what will be the securities for the achievement of the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, points out that "there's a lot of big securities."
The expert would draw up two large banks and several construction companies on the list, "because the electricity sector is already going to be very expensive".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco declares that growth is thanks to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The construction companies can be positive at the level of the rally, of course.
"ACS has been trying to restore its position for several months, and we hope that Ferrovial and the FCC construction companies will follow this path," says the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be a major part of the coming year due to the increase in sales that can be seen during the Christmas season.
On the other hand, experts believe that technology companies can be well-skilled, although in this area the representation in the Spanish market is not too high.
Seven years, five times.
In the last seven years, only two times since December has passed.
At the end of the real year, we were able to note in 2003 when wholesalers were excavated from the crisis caused by the outbreak of technological bubbles.
In this year, when Ibex 35 28,17 percent corrected, 668% of the increase was registered in December.
So it is still open that 2007 will be a five-year benefit for each other (only Ibex 8.36% has shown growth since January) and can lead to the final rally.
Open from 200 weeks to 12 hours open from the Banco Popular in Spain
The Banco Popular Spanish has decided to eliminate most of its members.
This is a total of 200, Spain's most commercially interested parties.
These guys run under the name of Popular Max and make a big difference to the bank.
For the rest of the Spanish institutions, however, since this is the first group to which their heads are held on a regular basis from 20 to 2030 on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20 a.m.
The other group, the BBVA, which has several times heard that his friends planned to open up longer, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, it is currently being prepared to agree with its professional organizations, which would close 75% of its employees to spend a day in jail, even though it is not for the public.
The experience of the Banko Popular Spain will be crucial to the other institutions, which will be decided on the same basis, whether they will join in supporting the development of better business.
This is actually the purpose of the Banco Popular Spanish project.
I would like to target private persons, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The Bank of Spain would like 200 boys to work with the above-mentioned openings for 18 months, not the same as the new opening system, but the restoration of existing ones.
To this end, the institution modernises its offices in commercial services according to the needs of certain street operators.
In this way, the extension of the opening time will try to rethink the role of boys, more modern and more colouring.
Ángel Rivera, responsible for trading banks, shows that there is no need for a large investment, but more uses must be employed, which means eight or nine workers in the current six place.
Boys who are also given a place for SMEs are not also going to sell financial products.
Adequate experiences
The Bank of Popular Spain has already implemented the initiative in three Madrid branches.
According to Angel Rivero, experience was pleasant.
The choice was made for boys in Madrid Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía on the streets, and according to Rivero, the decision proved to be correct.
The Bank of the People's Republic of Spain currently has 2,500 boys.
More than 60 are working under the name of the WorldCredit, which is special to immigrants and has a very attractive opening order, even on Sundays and Sundays.
In those units, PopularMax does not use the BBVA model where some boys offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
They will immediately be able to stop and sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles its rivalis, the value of Antenna 3.
"We did it."
With this statement, he concluded his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday, Paolo Vasile, the Deputy Council of Telecinco, when it appeared that the TV driver had doubled the value of Antona 3.
One day, he expressed his joy: "It's not just the pain that it's because we've increased more, but because we're smaller."
Even so, he made a lot of noise to say that we're less at night in the weak market.
Telecinco closed with 2,54 percent force last night.
This growth represents the annual loss of 15.66 percent.
52% of the company's Mediaset, 13% Vocento's, so the price is EUR 4,488.88 million according to Bloomberg's data.
Rivalisa, who lost 1,52 percent of Antena on 3 days of January and has been able to book 40,5 percent of the time since January, thus saving for the rest of the day for 2,193,46 million.
The other listed communications companies are worth 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; in the case of Prisa (the Cinco Días cadadoja), 2,518.53 million in the case of Vocento, and in the case of 1,779 million in the case of Cinco Días.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 can be found in two companies.
The question is just how much we can accomplish on the same market as the cost and how everything is going on in the field of vision.
Last week, Telecinco announced that this year he would like to be the first brutal 1-billion-dollar television player, said Giuseppe Tringali, the Councillor appointed by Telecinco and the Publicespaña.
If the notified event is to take place, the revenue generated from advertising in the financial year 2006 would be estimated at 965.4 million in the financial year of the interim financial year by 3.6 percent.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (up to 734.4 million), while the net price of television increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors behind Telecinco's position is the high pay out of all time: 100% of the company's contribution by President Alejandro Echevarría in 2006.
Vasile says - even if it's too early to decide - this rate can be changed with the mother rate of 33% after taking Endemol, with the Mediasetel.
"We are officially guaranteeing 50% of my minimum payment, even though we have distributed much more.
I hope this will be a pleasure for us, because we have already liked them with the conviction of the 33rd century Endemol."
According to the analysts, the market is currently characterised by some distortions.
The Lehman Brothers recently reduced their rates of return to Telecinco, still in 2008 by 7 percent in 4 and 2009.
According to our report, the estimated price increase is 8.5 percent in 2008 and 5.5 percent in 2009 and 5.1 percent in 2009.
According to the same company forecasts, the benefits of Antena 3 decreased by 4.5 percent in 2008 and by 7.5 percent in 2009.

Congress approves the acquisition of MiFID as adopted on 1 November
In Parliament's case, which today closed the Senate's amendments in favour of a Congress vote, the government initiated a social dialogue on the rule of law that both will be able to live before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups jointly expressed their efforts in negotiations and agreements between representatives and senators, which served to protect investors' most effectively, as well as to provide detailed rules on the activities of companies for the effective functioning of the market.
The Mifid, which amends the Charter of the Securities Markets, makes it possible to modernise the financial markets, while confirming the protection of investors, disseminates the rights of the Spanish National Securities Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation among the various European Union supervisors.
The new Directive makes it possible to provide financial advisory services to specialised companies, but also natural or legal persons, as well as securities-processing companies, securities companies and portfolio companies, to create a new financial service company (ESIS) called financial advisory companies (AFIs).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the implementation of monetary transactions, thereby contributing to the regulated secondary markets to multilateral trading platforms and to internationalisation systems that are competing with current financial entities.
In addition, the Network is required to provide market information on the aspects, risk assessment and risk management methods identified by the investment services, and to provide information on all operations performed.
The Congress's Economic Commission has tabled a number of amendments, one of which is significant that the securities are treated as a "complex" currency, and also because of the high risk for the investor, which is confirmed by the US high risk assessment (subprie).
On the other hand, the transposition of the Directive was also used to legally surround the scope of the activities of economic and business executives, all 30 years after the entry into force of the Royal Regulation, which was adopted in 1977 by only the competent authorities.
The Senate proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agents who work for another account, does not need to be authorised by CNMV and can sell products or acquire customers once more for several investment firms.
Consumer Árindex increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, taken into account by Eurostat for calculating the rate of European Union inflation, shows the rise in Spanish prices for November.
The public contribution of Eurostat and the European Central Bank is in line with the strategy to provide data that can be compared with data coming from the United States, both at the time of their intervention and in terms of their nature.
The first indicator number shall apply the same calculation method as the calculation of the United Kingdom Arindex, but the statistical modelling method differs from the assessment of the information which is not yet available at the moment when it comes to the public.
The Statistical Office has stated that the first indicator is merely information, so it can be distinguished from the final data to be made public on 14 December.
"The Consumer Árindex still shows high values."
Pedro Solbes, one of the government's vice presidents and the Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the increase to 4.1% of the Consumers' Árindex on November was only "indigenous", but at the same time indicated that the price index is expected to show "very high" values in the coming months.
In the course of Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "although my indicator is not really interesting", Spain's inflation rate in the monetary Union remained at least at the same level in recent years.
It also added that the November month "has brought less surprise" than the previous month when the government was not counted on such a large growth.
"We expected 4% of the value" was recognized by the Minister for Economic Affairs in relation to the data brought to the public during today's period.

More than 50% of Northern Rock's revenue is returned and currently only 12 billion pounds (16 billion euros 800 million) have been issued since the war took place in September and the British National Bank had to receive urgent credit.
There was still a record number of $25 billion worth of money, which has been significantly reduced over the past two and a half months due to the loss of trust of employees, despite the fact that the Government has signed a percentage guarantee to the bank by the end of the crisis.
Virgin's own financial and commercial name will operate this unit under the name of Virgin Money. The Virgins must receive as much as four of the British banks' incomes in the next three years in order to achieve the above 18 billion points and achieve the 30 billion targets.
In England, a large-scale businesswoman named Richard Branson, who became known as a major advertising campaign, found that he spent about 50 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) a year on advertising and marketing in order to achieve the desired goal.
The Northern Rock released the Virgin Consortium's offer last week as the best way to avoid your sword.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a alleged corruption case
Today, the City of Totana, located in Murcia, has been detained by the Censorship Authority because they suspect that he was involved in a week's urban corruption bombing.
Outside of Rajta, one of the guards of the Városa House and the police officers were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, a former city representative, took place in May in the place of the national representative Juan Morales, who could be head of the corruption network according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio station.
The police continue to investigate the city's offices and the Város-Development Council, and cannot be closed for further detentions to be expected.
His lawyer, Juan Morales, was also under investigation, as he suspected the head of a corruption bottled up in the week.
According to the SER radio station, the national lawyer Juan Morales was detained when he was just removed from Morales in his file concerning corruption.
According to police sources, the investigation was based on the expected benefits received by Morales because a Galician construction company signed a urban development agreement on the transfer of 200 hectares.
There are currently eight persons under arrest.
Bono will accept the identification of the PSOE in Toledo and the honour of the President of Parliament if they win the elections.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the Head of Government and, at the same time, the president of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, his offer to lead the list of PSOE's alternates in the next parliamentary elections and to include the President of Parliament's honour when the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Service Secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference, and he also confirmed Bono after a discussion with Zapatero in the party centre today.
The Head of Government urged the former prime minister to say "we have to count the best" in politics, and Bono was "the best."
In addition, he added that "probably" the Polish politician will be the socialist party to the honour of the President of Parliament if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would take over the position of current Parliamentary President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that it would not be in his interest to pursue the next elections and the political career of the future in a more scientific context against climate change.
The former Minister acknowledged that the Government has continued its efforts to return to the political scene since it was launched two years ago by active politics.
It also added that since the voters are aware of who the Economic Subcommittee will be in the case of the socialists' victory, the party would also like to inform them of the "intellectuality" of who will be the President of Parliament.
If Bono is really going to pay the bill, he would like Parliament to be "the respect and not the level of injury or kidnapping" and to be better compared to the home of citizens.
"In the meantime, it seems sad that Parliament is in the only place in Madrid where it cannot be talked slowly, before the government has broken up its speech 26 times in the Senate."
At the same time, he commended current President Manuel Marín, whose "excellent work", but he did not want to raise himself as a president, so that his opponents would be "compulsory."
Campoons for the weather
Since climate change is a non-lethal movement, it must be very strong for all those who behave objectively in the light of their forecasts and those who participate in political or social decisions.
In fact, you have to set up a political leader such as Governor Zapatero, who says that movement is more important than the fight against Islam's terrorism, and he says that "we need a new agreement with our Earth."
However, this note raises the question of the extent to which Spain is living within the Union in the absence of the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the agreement, which sector concerns, and why has the Government failed to do so?
In addition, it should clearly explain to the Spanish what measures are being taken to combat climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits should the population change, what level of energy should we consider, and what economic consequences will they have?
So who needs to make a sacrifice, and who needs to pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get it and we won't get an explanation for these questions.
That's exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
The measures taken by the climate change are not always popular.
Costs, benefits and expenses are available to all companies and to the population.
Even the PSOE gas emissions would have indicated that there was a general shortage before the elections that Zapatero would return quickly.
We must save the Earth from anything, from mere propaganda texts, empty, real consequences.
With agreements, committees, reports, new honours.
According to the Earth-wide agreement, the government leader, who speaks so well of the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, but strengthens the electoral assemblies and weaknesses within us.

Totana's mayor and police officers were arrested for a alleged corruption case
The Police arrested the mayor of Totana, the city of Murcai province, the National José Martínez Andreot, the local chief of police, the police officer of Városa, and a visitor company for crimes related to urban development, as reported by the police today.
The mayor was detained at the home and transferred to the Városha, and there are now several police officers who are conducting a number of investigations with the Város-Development Council and the Ipartaele and the Houses.
The three detentions were preceded by six detentions in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last week, in a case during which the managers were granted permission to build 4000 dwellings for the Galicia Nuaria company during their previous missions.
Two other persons have not yet been detained, but they are under investigation according to the information provided by the Court of First Instance.
The first six detained persons were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who is currently under investigation at the level of independent parliamentarians in Nepal.
The woman who owns an owned property agency registered in Totana is being examined at a level, as was the current friend of the former mayor, who lives in the centre of Murcia.
The manager and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., was held in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with the manager of the Suelo de Inmonvar company, Pablo José M.G., who also belongs to the Nuaria Group and is subject to damages through it.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group of members responsible for the offences committed at the intergovernmental level of the Central Unit of the Office of the Central Bank, whose members held a ten-month domestic investigation outside the detentions, primarily of the holding companies operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was detained: the owner of a well-known company in the area of baroque products, which could play a central role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have built its largest apartment park in Totana, which would have built 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company has purchased 2.2 million square miles of land in Totana, which has been overrated. The project has doubled the population of the currently 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is owned by companies such as Autesa e Inomonura, Vigo, Coruna, Venezuela, and Conycase, which is responsible for the management of the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and the Catholic Ferdinand Parks, which are directly marketed with Hogar and with the sale, promotion and love of buildings.

If they agree, we're a little surprised by the Book of Hoop, and we can look back at some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already trained you.

The Finnish scientists found this comment in one of the largest pages of Finland: (the PISA report on the world's level of art) in Helsinki Sanomat, followed by the criticism of the Blackburn book on 18 November.
"Philosophic teachings were presented after the tragedy of Jokele Gimnazim.
The killer, in his messages of prenatal students, recorded Plato and Nietzsche's writings.
The Teaching Council of Philosophy, Pekka Elo of the Helsinki Sanomat newspaper, asked the teachers to examine Plato’s teachings with a critical view, and then added that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily relevant to the basic philosophy of secondary schools.”
We've got three of them.
One of his colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code includes a criminal offence relating to Internet charges:
A. Loading a number of music is a crime, and six months can be punished for a year.
However, if you run at a rate of less than 400 euros in a bag, it is only normal (Article 623.1).
B. If you run at a price of EUR 1000, the thief is already guilty, but the penalty still does not apply to the amount of the penalty that would be fined in the case of online charges (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you run a car but you return within 40 hours, the penalty shall not still apply to the amount of the penalty to be imposed on the internet. (Article 244.1).
D. You can blame less punishment if you get into a fight than if you split the CDs.
If you take part in a multiple transaction, you can receive a three-month extension penalty (Article 154), but a six-month extension penalty for the CD card for a change of screen for a six-month period of two years
(CTK 270)
E. According to article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The sale of copyrighted films is more serious than the sale of pornographic material without involving the authors.

I got an article from my house doctor about a strange research: "The money's analog activity, especially if it's less than the rest of us."
So the employees' feelings of pay depend on how many others have received.
The experiment was carried out in the Boni University of Magnesiums with a tomography, and the results were also published in the latest issue of Science.
The author of the study and the director of the neurological group of the German Life&Brain Institute, Bernd Weber said: "We measure the most powerful activity when the participant responded correctly, but the company failed again."
The researchers found that if both of them had given the right answer and received the same amount of money, the physical activity had been measured, but if one of them had received double amounts, the activity had also increased.
I don't know why there was so much science for such a simple consensus.

Carla del Ponte has been indicted for eight years by the Office of the Criminal Court to investigate the crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
The mandate goes down at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a little quiet, as the Srebrenica blood transfusions, during which 8000 Bosnian Muslims, Ratko Mladic troops and Serbian Bosnian commander Radován Karadzsiks, are still free.
Their name is on the list chosen by the Swedish director Marcel Schüpbach as the name of the document film: Carla's list (2006, Spain has not yet been shown). The film is similar to the real crime in Belgrade from Belgrade to New York, while trying to pressure the governments concerned to spread the rumors about the crimes committed.
What kind of insurance do I have?
Vehicle insurance, which represents the security of the property of the vehicle in view of the various damages, and also depends on several factors such as the date of purchase of the vehicle, the date of purchase, the family status, the type of vehicle provided and the nature of use.
It's only the first step to buy a car.
Actually, the choice of appropriate insurance is much harder than to deny what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what's going on.
The motor vehicle security is the insurance company and the agreement between the insurance company and the secured.
This Agreement has killed a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company is in the head of the fixed insurance fee in the event of an accident.
The amount paid for the insurance is practically the amount determined taking into account the different factors, such as the date of the purchase of the right, the family state, the type of car, the use of it and the others.
The insurance companies are based on the statistics on the insurance price, i.e. the higher the amount of the payment that represents the higher risk.
This is why women are under 25 years of age or less paid because statistics indicate that they are less likely to be in danger because they are more careful.
Similarly, according to the exhibitions, insurance companies have concluded that those who live in marriage are less likely to be in danger than those in private.
The frequency of the vehicle type of use is determined.
The potential to prevent the accident is more easily used.
When the insurance fee is fixed, the insurance companies shall take into account a number of factors.
It is therefore necessary for the owner to consider, on a basis, the choice of the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we will show the most important factors in the selection, in order to best apply and build acceptable prices.
When the insurance contract is concluded, a number of grounds for 25 years should be calculated, such as the lack of management experience and the lack of legal certainty.
Even if we are most likely to be at risk, there are even more economic solutions.
The more careful drivers can be charged with full insurance on their own, thus ensuring that all of these are at risk and that the price can be paid.
In such a type of contract, the secured payment is part of the damage.
"The amount of self-defense paid by the secured is dependent on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the fee," says Luis Nogue, the head of the first European country of Spain.
Another option is the increased liability insurance for third parties when the agent provides himself against the damage caused by others, but not against the damage caused in his own car.
Besides, it's gonna be a trap, a fire and the car's destruction.
A good council.
If you're not 25 years old, be careful and you can handle the risks, because this is an opportunity for the bonus and so you can reduce the amount you pay for in the future.
They refer to the benefits granted to the insurance company's basicity.
And we call it a sentence for basic punishment.
"The amount of the bonus and the amount of the loan depends on the insurance company and its benefits.
If the company was a good year, it would allow you to gain a degree of bonus" he explained to Nogue.
If 25-year-olds have been transferred, the owners are more likely to be in a position to ensure that the risk is reduced due to the experience gained during the years.
Then we advise them to take full care of themselves.
"In general, young people are not able to properly apply their experiences in a single accident, not even when they are in charge," says the Director of the European Insurance Society of Spain, adding that most of the accidents follow the lead in the second year when leaders are already in fear of beginners.
If the insured woman is already married, but she still has no children, the best if she has full insurance, of course, if her financial opportunities allow it.
Insurance companies hold children's households in low-risk businesses, and therefore the payable price is lower in their case.
In this case, the best of full-time insurance (not to be made up of EUR 300) or if they have a higher bonus, the insurance can be extended from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused by the other.
"They lead slowly, while their buyers are larger and allow themselves to be higher than yours," says Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, the full insurance is offered voluntarily (about EUR 150) or in the case of a higher bonus.
Vehicle insurance is very important, not only because it means protection in the event of the damage caused by the owner but also because it means a large expenditure, so it is impossible to choose the insurance form for the person appropriately.
Celtic wants to get the point in Milan to get into the eight-star.
Milan and Celtic both measure their combined strength at San Siro Stadium to get the missing point at the Bajnko's League. Italians can be the first to do this, and shoes can qualify for themselves.
The Italians are all ten points, and they have already secured the transmission in the fifth round with a Portuguese, but Celtic has nine points, but another one should be for the six-point Shahktar, who will fight the four-point Benfia, not forwarding it.
The D group will hold two parts a week before the end of the current cycle, as Milan has to play in Japan at the World Trade Organization, where in its 13th preamble, he is attempting to extend the extension to the 16th decision.
This D group will soon disappear as the others, and even if the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the most likely result, the two teams will be able to win because the Italians do not want to stay home, and Celtic can move from a better place to the eighth floor.
The Gordon Strachan team also has enough to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but can't be sure, because if there's a punctuality, the victims will continue to be lost in Glasgow (2-1), but opened the next section (2-0).
The Italians will try to break up the night of the Scots who want to get into the eight-year-old Bajnkok League, once they get out of there in the next 0-0 extension.
The victory of the "Rossonerik" could be more fun for Shakhtar because if she loses her Celtic into the eight-year-old and you're in UEFA.
As Benfia, despite the fact that it is currently in the last place and in the possibility of survival in the European Union, can still gain the third place with a victory that could play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to participate in the first concert of the Spice Girls tournament.
Spice Girls in Vancouver, Canada, started his tour of 20,000 people in the first place since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Giri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert organized at the Vancouver GM Place, which was organized in the form of the "rem".
About 20,000 people have changed to be there at the concert where a video film was shown about the combined success of the 1990s.
Together with the reorganization and the tournament, a new album was released on the market in Spain, the EMI, which is the largest praisers and two new songs on the "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Spice Girls has five members from his husband's "Posh Spice" and a British focusist from David Beckham.
The athlete was also there at the GM Place's funeral, even though Victoria stopped him a few days ago.
When the show was under attack, Victoria Beckham said the British football star "did not see the playing clothes yet, so I'm excited about what you're going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice', was the reason that the joint played two years after he left the band in 1998 'because the members did not understand each other'. He was also excited during the press release that was held two hours before the concert.
"I've always been.
I was angry, but I saw people's feelings about Spice Girls changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I made it," Chisholm said about the co-operation that led him up to nine years ago.
The singer also added that in time, "the things were arranged and we love each other very much."
But he's changed a lot since Spice Girls was last in 1998.
According to CTV television, Virginia Airlines has arrived in Vancouver alone.
At the airport, a group of baby sitters were waiting for them.
Five of them have all seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team took place in California (USA), then in San José (December 4) and in Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
The event will take place on 23 December in Madrid.
Other fears about the Russian gas station
Between Ukraine and Russia, the gas supply, which can also affect the Russian fuel transport to North Europe, has been launched.
Much of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transmitted through Ukraine and the disputes between the two countries are always taken seriously.
He stated that if Moscow sends gas paid by the banks, they will also pay Russia a higher transit cost.
One, generally among the two countries, has reduced the EU's accession to the country as a result of the earlier debate.
The latest debate between Kiev and Moscow is on the ground gas monopolium in the Government of Ukraine and the Russian State, which concerns the gas level paid by Russia in 2008.
The Gazprom stated that 50 % increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the neighbouring Turkmenistan should be achieved in 2008 with Ukraine.
According to the analysts, this can mean a 40% price increase for Ukraine from the gasprom.
"It is important for us to comply with one of the most important agricultural transit traditions during the negotiations," declared the Economic Minister of Anatolij Kinah, in the newspaper Reuters.
"The changes in gas emissions should be combined in any way with the prices of transits carried out in Ukraine (and North-East Europe).
As a result of the most significant gas supply between Moscow and Kiev, the gas station in Ukraine was set up in January 2006.
This has resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Eastern Europe, which has raised prices to a large extent.
The Russian gas is one of the units of the EU's gas supply.
Russia has the world’s largest agricultural holdings, but most of them are still undisputed.
As a result, the gas supply of Gazprom from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries is complete with the US.
The NHS "should verify foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS committees need to improve the monitoring of the criminal record of workers from outside Europe - a supervisory body has announced.
The proposal was made by Robert Black's chief accountant, following the fact that in Scotland a foreign state doctor was contacted with the attack on the Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of seafarers.
At the same time, the report, under the auspices of five health authorities, also referred to key checks that were properly carried out.
Following an attack against the Glasgow airport, the accounting officer verified the list of applications taken outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullahot, a doctor at Royal Alexandra Kóráz, in Paisley, was subsequently detained at the airport for the destruction of the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who heard the Old Bailey hearing in October on the charges of motorbike bombing in the United Kingdom.
In the case of users from the maritime countries of the NHS, the NHS Committees shall verify the capacity and the share of the workers concerned and the necessary authorisations for employment in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Committees are using Disclosure Scotland in order to verify the possibility of criminal registration, the Agency has not been entitled to receive such specific information from outside Great Britain.
The rapporteur's report suggested, among other things, that the commissions should introduce a guide to the Criminal Reporting Office, which facilitates the checks carried out by different maritime countries.
"Even if we have found evidence of such checks among personal records, they are not carried out on a regular basis," the report states.
According to Black, Skot NHS will carry out its own pre-employment review procedure at the same level, adding: "Our report will draw up the developmental areas of the system in order to provide information on the number of personnel from the NHS seabed".
Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said "unrealistically unlikely" that we could identify potential NHS users who can follow terrorist actions in the future.
"The report states that pre-employment checks currently applied are well functioning in NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is still not transparent" - he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of seafarers from doctors and nurses in most of them is 1161.
However, the accounting officer pointed out that the figures were likely to be higher, which is part of the explanation that the Commissions had a problem with the identification of their use for unlimited time.
The investigation also showed that checks carried out in the Ayrshire and Arran areas, in Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, in Lanrkshire and in the NHS authorities in Lothian, are carried out in a large number of ways.
These procedures were designed to monitor road travel, employment permit and professional paper.
The Scottish Government is also examining the directive and guidance for checks on the use of NHS users from sea countries.
Nicola Sturgeon's health secretary declared: "I am very pleased that following the attack against the Glasgow airport, this mission has been successfully carried out.
He added that the government - in cooperation with the health committees - will take into account the recommendations contained in the report and will ensure that the full scope of the report - including the time-limits for pre-occupation checks - is the best practice, and that the updated change is planned to be published in the following month.
Joy Division takes the digital film
From the Joy Division's song, from Ian Curtis's biopic, the "Control", five prizes were awarded from the Brit Independent Film Dijkioszton - among other things the prize for the best film.
The principal, Sam Riley, who worked in a factory before the creation of Curtis, was also a member of Anton Corbin and Toby Kebbell.

And the Varyty Prize - to put the British film into an international reflection film - was taken by Daniel Craig, the founder of Bondot.
The fees were distributed during the ceremony held in the London Roundhouse.
The film "Control" shows Curtis's reputation in the Joy Division brains until 1980, when he was 23 years old - he committed suicide.
The production of "The Killers", David Bowie, and "New Order on the soundtrack" was made of only 3 million fonts.
The Dutch photo, Corbin - which was previously known for the production of the U2 "Joshua Tree" album, has been awarded two more awards; with the best director and the best beginner.
Another award for the event placed rock music in the center; Julien Temple Joe Strummer, a film about Clash's best documentary.
The best prize for the best dancer was Viggo Mortensen, organized by David Cronenberg, a triller in London, to be awarded as a driver of the "Victory Promises" mafia.
Ray Winstone, who was reported to be a professional actor, was involved in the Richard Harris Award for a brilliant contribution to the British film industry.
The five-year-old movie called "Scum", "Ehkoppon" and "Sex Day" is also part of the film industry called "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Christian Cup".
Winstone is proud to be able to take over the "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" star in 2002 named Harris.
"People like me have opened a hat for people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney," said Winstone.
"I really feel lucky I could meet Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, it was a great color of the old, and I really appreciate him."
A group of filmmakers, filmmakers and festival organizers decided to choose independent films named Bifa.
A list of Bifa's supporters and patrons, for example, Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Ngyy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbott.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were detained in connection with terrorist attacks
In Saudi Arabia yesterday, he announced that 208 terrorists were detained in the camps, who were planning to attack an oil facility, as well as more, church personnel and security forces.
According to the state television of the largest oil exporter in the world, one of the seeds wanted to pass over rockets.
Al-Kaida's supporters launched a campaign against Monarchia, which has been carried out by the United States as an alliance since the 2003 Iraqi invasion.
According to the television news, eight main seeds led by a foreign public population are to launch an planned attack on an oil plant.
Following a 2006 attack by Al-Qaida, the world's largest oil processor in Abqaqq, Saudi Arabia launched a 35,000 high-speed response effort to protect the facilities.
According to the Prime Minister's statement, 18 of the detainees belong to a seed which is an illegally transferred "person specializing in the actions of the State".
The report also reported that the wars were attempting to penetrate the realm of the kingdom by eight spies.
In the 22nd of these cases, plans were developed to address threats to church leaders and security forces.
The government has referred to the stronger action of the church leaders to defeat the Saudis who join the Al-Qaida-Harcoss in Iraq, who fight against the federal forces and the American support peace against the Muslim government.
The Al-Qaida wars are considered to be a significant part of the church leaders of Saudi-Arabia as those that the authorities have entered into the support of the ruling royal family policy of the government.
The organization’s wars - fueled by Al-Qaida’s leader, Osama bin Laden, were aimed at bringing peace to the people of the Soviet government - to attack foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"The security forces have made powerful efforts in the past...for five months" - a prime minister's television director announced.
During the detentions in Medina, a 16-year-old "media opinion" was also adopted, aimed at spreading "takfiri thought". Takfiri's thinking is the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports strong action against the unsatisfied and faithless Muslims.
The arrests included 32 persons who were accused of financial support by the militias.
The Earth’s Solar System can provide a perspective for Earth’s future
According to scientists' findings last night, Venus has been able to ensure a decent living conditions at the same time.
A European orbiting planet's data is based on the fact that this planet is much more visible than we believed before.
The Earth's nearest planetary area.
The size of the two planets is similar to that of our circle of rotation, although Venus is a little closer to Naphos.
According to today’s scientists, thousands of years ago, Venus was able to cope with very similar life conditions and even the inhabitants could be given.
However, because of the high level of greenhouse gas emissions, climate warming has caused atmospheric erosion and the lower rate of pollution in the world, Venus has reached a different stage of development.
The water has already been pumped out of the bottle, the temperature of the upper room is strong enough to absorb the smell, and it is destroyed by powerful waves and windy winds.
The findings of the Venus Express, based on a study of the planet for a year, draw a striking picture of how catastrophic climate changes can occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of the Oxford Physical Dance, who is one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, told the following: "Start to discover why Venus's summer is going so far from the Earth's experience, despite the fact that the two planets are quite similar.
"With the help of our new data, it has become possible to produce a marketing book on the development of Venus billions of years ago, while it has been available with similar living conditions on Earth.
Police arrested by "indicted uranium"
A glass of radioactive material was stored by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday, according to reports.
According to a police spokesman, three people were detained and the material was also subjected to investigation.
The speaker did not confirm whether it was a sealed gold, but stated that it could have been given for $1 million (480,000 pounds).

According to Romney, he does not deserve to be appointed to a presidential election to answer questions from a human being.
The president's presidential elections also joined in a debate on YouTube, which organized questions for weekly voters and forwarded them to the candidates.
On the evening of November 28, none of the issues raised on the evening of November 28, proved to be more decisive than the man who asked the Democrats about global superiority in the question of the other party on YouTube.
However, questions and answers have sometimes well reflected the situation of a Republican party approaching the next year's election.
Firstly, it was not known that the CNN manufacturers responsible for the co-finance of the dispute had specifically chosen the YouTube clips that were distributed to them.
The worst question of the first half of the debate was the immigration.
This issue is one of the most important threats to the Republicans.
The CNN raised a number of unconfirmed voters that if there is a negative number of things to be heard, they will discuss a number of them: the medium-sized consensus was experienced when the designated party was forced to make a statement on the question of the limits.
The most recent and most recent debate arose between Rudy Giuliani, who lived at the national level, as well as with Romney, in the key priorities held in Yowwwa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to change the picture of it, according to which it has been too easy to deal with the issue of illegal immigration under the mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of setting up illegal immigrants to build the house.
The speech between the two became particularly bold when the questionnaires were interested in the support of the Amnesty (which would ensure the possibility of permanent status and public opportunity for illegal immigrants).
Some of the least-voting figures - such as Duncan Hunter, Californian and Tom Tancredo - have been able to rely on the theme on a good basis.
And even if none of them are aware of the possibility of staying in the competition, it may be clear that they have begun to beat the noise of immigration earlier and more loud.
At least there is a broad consensus on immigration issues among the candidates: the common objective of strengthening the borders and a difficult step with regard to illegal immigrants.
This theme - whether the fear of China’s gambling games and other refreshing factors coming from the world - will help the Republicans in their minds to achieve or minimize the division between the liberals and the Christian conservatives.
However, when other specific topics were presented, the debate was quite unheard of.
Giuliani had to consider the question why he had previously supported arms control.
John McCain and Romney questioned whether the symmetrical water intake is likely to be affected.
Another question was about whether the sign believed all the words of the Bible.
At the end of this discussion, Giuliani was able to point out that even if his favorite books considered the Bible, he might not have understood the Bible’s account of Jonah and the Flood.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus could support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was the first to receive the embodiment of the iowa election, can be grateful for the Christian Conservativeism that can be won, has responded to the expectations that the death penalty is painful, but needs it.
When asked if Jesus would receive sufficient support, he simply said that Jesus would give more wisdom than he would take on the choice.
The competition is still open.
Huckabee's iowa's legacy is connected with the liberal Ron Paul's money-gathering action and the evening after he's gone.
The immediate prevention of the two signs can explain that the couple’s two origins have not yet been able to start together among the most familiar and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a sign that united the party, who in time and firmly fought the victory message of America's greatness and who found the common voice with both of the births.
Now, however, the party is divided, and its consequences are invisible.

New sections were added before Gordon Brown; the driving route was unchanged
The present does not seem to be too remote for the British political boutiques.
No one has given his prize, no one has been given the same policy, no one has followed a wedding anniversary.
However, it is clear that under the name of another economic operator, over four years ago, a total of 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) were added to the British Government's Labour Market, and that the party did not report this, one of the things that would have been done without Gordon Brown in the vicinity.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister dismissed the election and said that there was no influence on the outcome of the decision - without considering the ability of the British to understand it, people were still hoping that Brown would ensure a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the leader of the liberal Democrats, noted with more inspired comments, was once moved from Brown Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The late bank, called Northern Rock, made a move to rescue the regulatory weaknesses and a lack of judicial capacity.
The proposals for changing the tax law encouraged business interest groups to meet with the government.
The 25 million people's personal data, the tax loss of the authority, is an unimaginably large administrative deficit.
In the House of Lords, three peace-keeping teams opposed the reduction of the military's budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Defence was part of the employment.
And now there's David Abrahams' secret donation; Peter Watt, the chief of the Labour Party (former administrative director) has already been released.
These accidents don't mean Brown couldn't get back on the way back to the exit.
At the same time, governments are able to achieve a point beyond which direction is impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but they usually depend on their credibility when they reach a new group.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is not likely to be in a position to predict matters and may not remain in his post for a long time, the result of the uncertainty: the civil servant army will begin to undermine, the cabinet ministers will look at the media after the bad news; and the government will begin to protect and concentrate in an informal manner.
In a sense, Brown is in particular in a difficult situation, because he does not count "frish blood" against other political leaders.
No matter how much you want to accept Tony Blairhe's relationship, it's still the best.
For example, the problems of Northern Rock and the tax notes are linked to the decisions made during the Brown Finance Ministry.
And even in Blair's comments - for example, the "moneylessness" issue and the ongoing relationship between the political party financing - was not directly involved, but voters could provide for the right to oppose it.
Even if Brown's position is as harsh as it seems, it's not as nice as it looks.
The twisted balsams are not as thick as the tortoises represent.
As for Mr. Bean, no one has died, no one has been directly sent to him.
And the torture - no matter how painful it may be - can always be a reliable guide by Stalin, who lives in Brown: reliable, secure and a little hard government.
For example, he serves as a political donor.
The proud man Abraham, who likened his gift to a gift of kindness, declared that he did not want to take part in public affairs.
It may be, however, that the decision was not part of its effect.
The law prohibiting the anonymousization of large political supporters is clear and clear: the population has the right to know who is responsible for the leadership of the country.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew of Abraham's measure, was not legally pure, but will certainly be exposed during the hearings; as was Jon Medleson, the founder of the Labour Party, who was informed in October of the damages.
But to Brown, first of all, they don't lead the waves: there's nothing that would have been able to know about these obstacles, nor that they would have been made after the arrival of Brown to the June office.
So far, the Prime Minister has fulfilled his mission.
The legal value of the party's party was so low, however, that it encouraged the completion of a known instrument; the investigation of the case, for the sake of security, entrusted a new draft and a judicial committee.
In this case, the "learning leuke" wasn't too complicated.
In case of a crime, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown has to arrange other things, such as the appointment of the President of the Independent Committee on Rules of Management, which is not in force for six months, or the effective reform of the political partnership.
This would require cooperation with the parties and the separation of special financial relations with the parties from the hard-core job market - this would be a difficult challenge for the Brown Party.
But you should look at some of the party-related facts.
According to the surveys, the conservatives are currently taking a serious advantage; Brown has two years to return the voters after him; the only way to achieve the victory is to overcome the incompatibility and strong competence.

Is it threatening the US credit card market for the secondary market credit crisis?
If blood goes into the water, it's natural for cats to be present nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weak, workers are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs' analysts believe that if the crisis of the signatory crisis affects other forms of population credit, the loss of the credit card market can also be estimated at $99 billion.
The signs of pregnancy are clearly visible.
It has increased the rate of description showing the rate of uninformed credit and the rate of payment of late payment over 30 days.
HSBC reported $1.4 billion losses in the US Consumer Fund, partly due to the financial deficiency of card holders.
At the same time, the panic is early.
The rate of the descriptions and delay payments remains low.
Moody's credit rating agency estimated at 3.89% of the third quarter's late payment rate by a total percentage lower than the historical average.
The reduction of the wheels can be explained by technical factors.
The change in the US rules of non-payment in 2005 has resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of reporting participants, while a significant loss on the market of credit cards; the increase in the number of claims (and this description level) is expected, regardless of whether or not the total of the terms of the credit agreement is inconclusive.
The rate of payment, which shows the level of the monthly credit loss of consumers, is stable on the market.
In addition, the trust placed in securities held with the credit card is strong despite the fact that structural funding has appeared in other areas.
Dennis Moroney, a research company in the TowerGroup, estimated that 2007 emissions volume would be higher than 25% above its level.
The characteristics of the market crisis are clear to the credit card market: consumers are speeding up the burden on credit cards.
At the same time, card exchangers are primarily concerned with money laundering and not with instruments, so it is not necessarily appropriate for residents to change the credit quality of creditors.
The situation of believers can be as beneficial as it is.
If the property is less than the price of the ticket, the consumer will be encouraged to lose credit; as a result, the return of the debt on credit cards will take place in the priority line.
By changing the terms of the cards or credit limits, the card exchangers can apply to the notice holders faster and faster.
This would have to be expected to reduce the risk of rapid re-use of the instruments.
"It's not likely that one day we'll wake up to fully appreciate the beliefs," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
If a sudden crisis is less likely on the credit card market, the risk of increasing return is much higher.
If the prices of the reduced housing market and the return of the credit are reduced to the United States, the industry looks forward to the future without any doubt.
I'm interested in trying those triggers.
Brit bankers accused you of a crime in the case of Enron
The three British bankers who were established to investigate their role in a family called Andrew Faston, were convicted of serious crime.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were accused of being innocent in his weekly family debt, which provided that they cooperated with Fastow in a secret marriage that was required in 2000, which they wanted to pay for their employees' expenses.
Their negotiations started in January.
But in a court hearing, the U.S. District Court, Ewing Werlein Jr., recognized the crime committed in the same court.
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Greenwich NatWest has been known in Great Britain for the first three years during the two-year term.
The findings of the investigation of the case initiated following the collapse of Enron in 2001 are still expected in the United States.
The first complaint against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the aims of the government's investigation to determine Enron's strength.
"NatWest's Harmas" was banned by three blocs in 2000 in order to prepare the family with Fastow and Fastow acori better.
Fastow, responsible for the design of an endless cycle of Enront’s neck, also held the Enron’s apartment, in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of the participation in the event, but the three British men knew that interest was essential.
A company managed by a Kopper bought the bank’s share of $1 million in the loan.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in order to get a share of this company.
According to the charge, Fastow immediately informed Enront that the energy company would buy from the Greenwich NatWest a 20 million-dollar investment.
In fact, 20 million dollars were sold by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charge is that the bankers are 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others are worth 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow reported his alleged crime because of the role he played in Enron’s conspiracy.
The British were detained three months later.
Fastow is currently sentenced to six years in a state federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spent three years in prison for a month.
Three English men were able to travel to the United States at $1 million on their own, where they were held at per hour.
Enron, the largest American company ever reported since December 2001, was unable to remove the millions who had died as a tax or income source, but actually lost companies.
As a result of the merger, the market value decreased by more than $60 billion, and the price of pensions decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's founder and former manager, Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted of their criminal activity in the company's headquarters.
Skiling is currently in prison for more than 24 years.
Lay's murder, rape, and other charges were dropped by the man's death last year.
No poverty in Moscow
It starts at $54 million with a Rolls-Royce engine equipped with a Golfstream G550 aircraft that will make a tank without interruption between Moscow and Los Angeles.
But this amount only counts for some Russian money.
Dan Firer, Guffstream's representative.
"No one shall make such a appointment because the machines are bought for private families or business managers."
Mr. Firer counted the visitors on the four-day, exclusive, Millionos in Vásar, which was held in the powerful exhibition halls in the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury items were placed on the exhibition, hoping that the Russian authorities would be interested in everything, from the mahogany-staining shells into the diamond, 50 cents of refrigerators.
As Mr. Firer looked around, he was watching the light orange porsche on the stand next to him.
"A nice car, but it doesn't touch our products," he said.
"The largest market in Russia after the United States of America is private aircraft."
It seems that the Russian capital is sitting in the money as Dallas did in the light of the oil spill.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were regarded as material here." Marshall Goldman, a senior assistant to the Centre of the Russian and European Studies in Harvard.
In the 1970 ’ s, the Soviet Union and Japan’s success in the 1990s have now reached the world’s most popular exchanges.
The most legible luxury brands are required from the orange.
In another Moscow conference organized by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH shared its opinion on how to sell large-value products in similar markets in Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
Forbes, according to a list of the largest people in Russia, is 53 billion lives, totaling $282 billion.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second half of the year is 103, all of which are able to own 670 billion dollars, a study conducted by the Economic and Monetary Research Centre in the area of the former Soviet Union.
(On the basis of World Bank data, in 2005 there were 15.8 percent of the population living in Russia under my constitution.)
"More than a hundred million lives in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a London marketing and marketing representative of David Morris.
Nicole was first involved in the purchase of the Russian brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all immeasurably dressed, and men are meant to be a real prize."
Two shopkeepers, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova, and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, all of whom were owned by their clients and their customers.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said young Yumatova, who was in her unique design, as if she had already contributed to this launch.
First of all, the purchase was arranged for the new customers, the brand-oriented Russian buyers, who, after hours spent on the sale, have been surrounded by a huge, digitally decorated place where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum bags, Mövenpick ice cream, regular billions of hotels, Dubai-i apartments and Gund-plish maces.
For the average people, the income is EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know what brands are the best and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who took a home-looking position at the Dutch Porcelain producer, at the Royal Delft Station, in view of a falsified, hand-drawn, blue-shaped Rembrandt.
"The Russians are definitely more interested in the obvious things."
In fact, the sellers here said that the old Russians (meaning 10-15 years old on the basis of the Russian walls) had already been separated from the wanted logos to brands which would not come into a commercial purchase.
Yet, more than a hundred people, including millions, millions of people, and tourists, spent the place daily.
And some of them were bought.
On the first day of the show, Roman Ersov, the director of King Koil's estates, told him, on the first day of the show, he gave two, one hundred dollars, made of silver, casmium and cotton, with a gold mine.
On the first day of the night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, an A1 Moto sales agency dealing with the supply of high-quality cars to modern customers, calculated that the company sold Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170.
Andrei Karapetian, the luxury manufacturer for the special requirements, L.A. Connector, sold three refrigerators to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday for the last day.
The reporters also showed them to the owner of a Russian casino, who, according to Swarovski, came to see a roulette band with them.
It's a four-pound set price: $22 billion.
"The Russian millionaire who's made up of squash and his wife's face wants a picture made of a circle of risk, will not necessarily use these things," said Karapetian.
"Let's put the 30-40 car in a guard garage to protect them."
Despite the fact that many of Russian employees, Karapetian says that the "Russian million" expression format does not mean a great deal, but rather a generous increase in the ownership of property.
"He who bought property in Moscow four years ago, today is probably millions, if not in money, but at least a paper."
"They've got more to think about."
Those who were not millionaires could at least have been shown the economy before the company owned by the Alliance Continental Russia.
The company built a four-, English-style phone sheet that was killed by millions of dollars and hundreds of dollars.
You know, Karryev, the company told the marketing manager, the team printed a fake bank note for the millions of people.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money, prepared a lot of photos on your cell phone like you're trapped in the money grid, or they're just making a couple of millions of dollars.
"Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel themselves," said Karryev.
They're suspicious of the Sebesche art after a murder in New Jersey.
The day before the visit, it happened that Ronald Livingston looked at my restaurant called "Just in a Better Health" and saw it as a healer lying on Cape Cod with two doors on West Scott Avenue.
Not long later, a police driver arrived.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stopped," said Mr. Livingston, one of the supervisors working in my restaurant.
"Then I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old named Olga Arroyo, who used to work as the assistant assistant of the chief of the network police.
The investigation is currently under way to state whether the death caused by an interview by a cosmetic surgeon not identified by the police under 212 who worked without permission from the West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet been able to determine what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the toxicology tests will be made available in a few weeks to this mysterious death, which has affected the high level of work of the network police.
Arroyo, who has been well-known in the department since September 2006, worked as an assistant to the police director Gary F. McCarthy.
"He was loyal, courageous and trustworthy," declared McCarthy Arroyo in a weekend interview on the phone.
"He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was a former newrk police officer, currently his wife, Jimmy Arroyo, who worked on the Committee on the Control of the Four-Seziper Products, and two, 14-year-olds and 11-year-olds, and she left a girl behind.
Eileen Walsh, Union again attorney Theodore J. Romankow announced that the investigators were working on the claim that Mrs. Arroyo needed to be a victim of an illegal abortion.
"I'm sure of it," said Walsh.
"The test is still going on."
Authorities report that about 3 hours from the south to the house on November
Mrs. 21 and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
They've already reported dead on the scene.
More than a week went by, and the police first paid very little for the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if the investigators had heard of Castro.
In the study, participants are investigating whether a part of the house was functioning as a medical director.
No one opened the door in Castro's house, where he was sitting in the tiny front of the house and pulled a needle from the back of the house.
At the main entrance of the pen, Etil Vanilin has an empty window with an "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilia in food and perfumes.
From the camp, two mountains were turned to a rough side.
McCarthy left when he first arrived in Newark 25 years after his first visit to Newark by helping him to join the new town's unaccompanied and unsanitary political culture.
"He always said, "It's better to take care of it."
"He's been here since I arrived in the morning, and he's always been in when I woke up at night.
It was a nightmare."
The expectations of Fed's smoking lead to the deterioration of world market share
On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the participants gathered yesterday, after the statement of ease of the position of the President of the Central Bank increased their hopes that Fed would be able to ease the investment opportunities further.
Participation markets in both London, New York and Europe were found following Donald Kohn, who declared the Ben Bernanke's best hands, to be "sustained and pragmatic" by the leaders of the financial markets.
In addition, Kohn had a clear objective of putting the markets at the centre of the brand-new credit mark, he stated that the current deficit "partly recovered progress towards the end of September and October on the market".
He said that if the increased uncertainty continues to increase, it could increase the possibility of further distortions of credit for households and companies.
In order to stabilize the credit conditions, the investors explained that Fed is ready to inject fresh capital to the US markets or even further cuts.
The comments also made a positive effect on Wall Street, which is now more of a bad news for America's economy. For example, this was the negative record of the number of American dwellings.
The impact of the financial deficit has also been strengthened by the report by the Bear Stearns Investment Bank, which provides 4% of the total cost of the United States secondary-market housing sector for the purpose of combating losses, as part of the reduction of the budget, and 4% of the global labour force.
A total of 20 jobs are covered by the above measure by the Council of the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
In New York, the Dow Jones averaged index 331 points, increased by 2.55 percent and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the longest S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index 165.5 points, increased by 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2 and adjusted the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 points.
German Dax 2.6 percent, while France grew by CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
The credit market deficit was renewed after the large auction organised by the European Central Bank for the three-month drive-out paper had not been seen in April 2001 at a large price of 4.7 percent to the European banks.
Following the same growth in the English central bank, Libor achieved the highest values since September, 6.59 percent, and the Bank of England had a greater pressure on the Bank of England to follow Fed and the ECB, and to allow the London monetary market to make a substantial increase.
In England, the decision is taken between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who's the English team going to be active in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in relation to the first test against Sri Lanka, who's at least important to make the decision?
The last question is current because David Graveney, president of the electoral board, who is temporarily carrying out this particular task, is helping Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the director of the English business office, Hugh Morris, is beginning to deal with issues relating to the national or at least one single electoral post.
Of the two players, it's the shortest one that doesn't get the sixth seat, but, as it is known, life, and mainly the sport is often unfair.
It's never easy to say how a person's assignment feels, while there's no way to go beyond another level. It's much more lucky than it's possible.
It's not just cricket that it's hard to choose on a multi-subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopar to advance?
Is it fair to see Shah if this happens?
The same question can be asked in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, with two clear, excellent conclusions, will set the business before the decision-makers, while only one of us has a place.
Who can tell what level a cricket is without getting into deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, data have a great impact on the decision, but the same is also important.
In one group, the player has to catch the captain's attention at the right time in the cricket gate, and a player has to get a regular chance if he wants to become a big player once.
The voter's appearance is much more complicated.
In James Anderson, for example, they played better in the last season, but he's still sure a team in the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's having a good way of saying it, and he's going very well for him.
Anderson won his part in the tournament with the first class team and 33 runnings.
Chris Tremlet just hit 29 but both of them were already successful at the highest level, and they hope they will be.
That Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, so this will be done on the basis of the opinions.
This decision may set up or dislodged any career, but it may be expected that it will not have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Garreth Batty played all the same test and performed with five hats and 40 useful runnings, yet Paul Collingwood, who was in the acorresponsible, was the one who grew up and determined to cross a test, which may still be appreciated in Australia, despite having acquired a double percentage point against the Austrians.
It is likely that when you listen to the experiences of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores in their conversation in Asgiriya Stanion during the game, you will experience much more than the experience of Shah, with the life of young Bopara and dynamics.
They're both saying yes.
In addition to Shah, the light and successful deboutment of the 88th Bombay test was completed in the fourth half of the 88th year of her life. She was seven years younger than Bopara, 22-year-old, who also appeared in a series of private boxing boxes, she was the first 32 percent of the class.
But the fact that the Middlesex player Shah was at home in May, in Lorda, only ten in your fourth against the West Indies, and that the fighter Vaughan, who fought in the next game, was immediately opposed, seems to have reduced the tension that he saw in Bombay.
In view of him, the universal ability of Essex is a life-threatening and unsurpassed player.
Nothing can be done with the cricket floor, but it was well-marked outside the palace when the team's car boss, Volkswagen's four.
Despite this, he got fewer injuries and probably got a lot of it. Nevertheless, the legitimate thing he did was to get Vadaphone's (naturally sponsored) phone and call his remote team, Alastair Cook, to ask him, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a better-looking player with classics. He makes a handbag for his short steps, and he's free and guilty.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the true art of choice.
I'm personally going to give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah will give a big deal if - how the ceylon tips are made - he'd be the one who's playing at the weekend.
Buses are transported home to work and fight with Al-Qaida
Since yesterday they come from Syria to Baghdad with the first busloads of those who have lost their money or lost their visas, or with the fact that those who hope to return to the city have returned the order.
There are also those who have come back to fight with the soldiers who have avoided them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already full of passengers from Syria and Jordan before arriving in Damascus, 800 people, more than a dozen bus drivers, arrived.
"Then I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"Today I came back because I saw what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say that the Mahdi army stopped killing people," he added, following Moqtada al-Sadr militia leader, who has now set up his army.
A 38-year-old high school teacher from Amariah, Qassim al Atwana, who lived with his two children at home, was unable to renew the visa and because the Otati section prevented the students from doing the work.
His neighbors called him and urged him to go home, saying he was able to clear Al-Qaida from their trusts in the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a sleepy and peaceful tribal leader who left his home in northern Bangladesh, Sleek, after his citizens started to fight Al-Qaida.
He's back in the army.
"Two days ago my friends called and said they had created an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they needed the support of me and my son.
That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the fact that the American troops had strengthened peace since the invasion of the capital and that the armed civilian forces, in cooperation with the United States, had forced them home.
However, they were even more willing to return from Damascus because of the water and material concerns.
51-year-old Salaam al-Samarii, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarii, gave a wide range of views among the refugees, according to which Minister of Peace Nouri al-Maliki asked the government of the country to send the missing water demand to make their home available.
It is estimated that more than two and a half million deaths in the country have been avoided.
"It was all right until al-Maliki did not visit Syria and did not use pressure on the government not to give more visas to the people in order to move them home," said the Sunnita newsman.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who broke my house after I left."
One of the reasons for the failure of the forces was that the settlements were removed from the coastal areas, while the rivers were also removed from the areas of the village, which resulted in a decrease in fertility in many areas.
Many insist that the sudden appearance of the missing is reminiscent of the interests that can lead to even more wars.
Small Saar - level training
The leadership of the smallest federal institution has played an important role in vocational training, which is an international approach to higher education.
Only in one training area do the Saar videos fight the same weaknesses as other parts of the country.
"I explained five times yesterday in a Saar video that we are not French" - this is the use of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal record in the U.S.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saar-Vied Education System, which can be achieved on the basis of the survey by the German Institute for Economic Affairs (IW).
In this way, higher education institutions are working closely with neighbouring countries because of their traditions.
The Saarbrücken School was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can shut down their studies today with two, actually three diplomas.
According to this, 15.6 percent of your foreign audience is high.
However, the Saar-Vidian students also practice average top quality in the Saar-Vidian schools and universities - many of them do not have high school finals.
"Saar videos use the opportunities for vocational training," explains Axel Plünnecke, a German Institute for Economic Education.
Young people have more than one fifth of their continuing education rights in school, with Saar visas in more than seven percent of the federal average.
The combination options for vocational and vocational training have also been well developed.
The number of people in the second place in Germany is the infrastructure of the two studies.
However, despite practical training and increased interest, the number of final measures has decreased by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saar-Vidian Ministry of Education has committed to marketing the higher education institutions in which the metrics are located.
"We started a number of reforms in general schools following the first Pisa study," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Education.
That is why the government has introduced comparative tests.
In order for children to start learning early, the last spring is free of charge. It's a model that in time has also started to divide the relationship.
In order to ensure that the performance of the students is a lasting success, only comparative studies will be provided in the future.
On the basis of the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the rate of risk-related students increased by 29 per cent.
However, as a whole, the performance of the Saar regions has not yet been achieved as far as the rest of the association.
The buggers are getting better.
In the Pisa survey, the majority of Saar videos are not taking into account foreign-language knowledge - otherwise, in this area, they could be shown differently,
because neighboring countries have a responsibility in the surrounding countries - even if the Saar-Vids are not French.
Name will transfer the hours
In Venezuela, the clocks are different in the near future than in other parts of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will restore time rates in Latin America by half an hour.
In the meantime, Chávez has become a subject of controversy in Spain.
As Venezuela's official daughter announced, in a new law, the Greenwichi period is four and a half hours back in time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a period that the world is not in use in any other country.
The U.S. Anti-Secretist Chávez, among others, made a decision by which the United States has spent all hours of its time on the world.
In addition, his name (in local time) has reported a sudden deterioration of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to an earthquake.
The Nordic national politician stated that while the Conservative President Alvaro Uribe remains, Colombia does not have a relationship with the Head of State or the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," Chavez declared, who advocates a reform of the Constitution on which the citizens of Italy must adopt an opinion within the framework of a referendum on Friday.
The reform will have a significant impact on the country.
Uribe's excellent cause was the decision to withdraw from Cávez's mandate to negotiate with Colombian Marxist relatives for freedom of expression.
He bought Venezuela with his decision on Thursday of Thursday, Chevez.
He's talking about everyone in Spain.
In the country, a new mobile chat show was held: "Por que no te Callas" (Why don't you go in), - that's how you hear what more than half a million people have spent on the Internet.
The phrase comes from János Károly, the king of Spain, who was so well-informed at the latest in Latin America that he wished to speak.
In 2007 the reduction in beer is threatening Germans
According to a forecast, a real-life reduction threatens German workers in spite of a strong environment.
The petitioners have been subjected to the threat of a pessimist.
According to the Hans-Brückler Foundation, in 2007, the applications can actually be counted less than in the previous year.
"This loving development, the growth of the general commercial tax, and the rapid increase in food and energy resources," said Gustav Horn, a daily worker at the Institute of Macroeconomics and Conjunctivators.
In the case of unemployment insurance, there may be three additional burdens on workers.
The Minister of Finance, Mr Peer Steinbrück, announced in his statement to the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", that the reduction in the current situation of decent and flexible unemployment was 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency must not make it so difficult to pursue the association for credit or support, the German social democracy party, the SPD policy.
It was well known that the purchase of food and olive products has resulted in the highest inflation for 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by 3 percent.
The Death of the Earth’s Sufficiency
In spite of this, Venice has been better compared to Earth than it has been supposed to be: In the near future, the European Venus Express has seen wildfires, while the lakes have been covered with lightnings like those that occur in the Earth.
Nearly three decades, scientists estimate that they live in Venus.
The "Venus Express" of the European Union has served as a witness to the creation of electromagnetic waves on the shores of the sky: The nearby villas of Venus are located at a height of 56 km above the surface, and is known as the founder of the "Nature" scientific magazine, Christopher Russell, of Los California University.
According to the famous "historic theory" the evolution of Earth's life was taught by the villas: According to the theory, the geologists initiated reactions in the ocean that led the amino acids to form life structures.
Not in Venezuela, "If there was ever a life there, it could be in very early times," explains Sean Solomon from the Washington Carnegie Institute.
At present there can be a living organism on the surface of Venus: the circle is hundreds of times larger than the Earth, and the temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"It may be that the Vennus is a traitor to the Earth's planet, but it is still a traitor," said Russell.
The main question of the Esa mission is why you live in a completely different development path in the extent and size of the Earth.
The beginning of the "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of Venus, because since the beginning of the 15th century, there has not been a one-week trip to explore this planet.
The latest research results in several "Natur" articles have been shown by researchers, according to their opinion, are not only proof of the uniqueness of the Venetian Sun.
"It is also shown that the neighboring planet's similarity to the Earth is greater than we were originally supposed to be," said Esa.
In addition to a well-known North-West Forest, researchers have also discovered an even faster superpower in the Déli-Sargan.
The presence of the Earth's East Hemisphere reminds us of the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrophysica Spasiale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second largest planet of the Solar System is almost the same as the Earth, and it is almost as large as the Earth with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The constellation also named Estanjalcsla is known as Napot for almost 225 days.
However, it is much easier to turn around its own coast: a Friday is 243 days on land.
Although the 460 Celsius superheated temperature of the Vénus 92 bar is almost as low as the Earth, scientists are aware that both planetary conditions are very similar.
Both of you have experienced a flood that has remained as a ocean on Earth as long as Venus has gone into the world.
And as long as the earth is bound by carbon dioxide, most of this atmosphere is caused by Venus.
Köhler takes Markel's meeting with the Dalai Lamá
Köhler, the German President of the Federal Republic, follows the conclusion of the debate between the parties, which is about the adoption of the Dalai Lama office.
In a related way, he criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor following September's adoption.
Mr Köhler of Germany expressed concern about Germany's attitude and recommended that the higher education be given to the debate about the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We will not be allowed to show ourselves as a divided nation on this issue," Köhler announced to the Board of Tradesblatt.
Köhler shared his understanding that Angela Merkel had adopted the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights are equally valid to me even if I respect the difference between cultures," Köhler said.
It is clear to all that Germany must deal with the political balance of the foreign policy, the President of the public, but Merkel was protected in the light of the argument that the Chancellor would continue the new Chinese policy.
"The federal office has not broken up with the traditional "one China" policy.
That's what China's got," Köhler said.
Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD), gave his voice for the rejection of the Dalai Lama and therefore became the target of attacks in the EU.
Steinmeier, among other things, called for the EU's policy on foreign policy.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Láma Chancellor Office, months of disturbances occurred in the German-China region.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Minister for Finance Pierre Steinbrück (SPD) but also extended the Strategic Dialogue between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries, according to the SPIEGEL information.
Wen Jiabao, China's president, has now referred to Angela Merkel's federal Chancellor as having failed to accept the Dalai Lama.
China rejects that when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan religious leader, it strengthened the Chinese position Wen Jiabao.
Dalai Láma's actions and words indicated that he was trying to break down the Tibetan and other Tibetan territories of China today.
Schäuble from similar condoms to France
Utcai meetings with the police, fugitives, funny cars: Wolfgang Schäuble is a member of the French border.
All that needs to be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from turning into street forces, followed by the Federal Deputy Minister.
Barriers have been shot, randomized with a series of shootings against the police: Young French citizens are suffering from similar developments in Germany after serious disturbances by the Federal Minister of Defence Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU).
"We have to say that we are the social robot, and we don't want to get up and jump into power.
We really have to do it," he announced to the news on the "New Presse" in Hannover.
Not all young people are convinced of the rapid change in social truth.
Societies, communities and communities are currently working intensively to solve the problems, Schäuble said.
It's not just the integration of immigrants.
"The first success will be demonstrated in close cooperation with the Islamic Conference."
But it's too early to solve the threat situation.
Schäuble strongly rejected the fact that in German cities there are no urban and sociological problems such as France.
In Paris, the last few nights, young people fought heavy street fights with the police.
Cars and public buildings were also rented in Toulouse.
In view of all of this, the Head of the Federal Government, Kenan Kolat, the leader of the German Associations, has been more active in the area of integration.
In connection with the French riots, Kolat warned of the "dangerous dangers".
Although the situation in Germany is not as comfortable as in France,
It's still necessary to act.
Kolat said that the unemployment rate is "more than average" around 25 years of young people born from immigrant families.
You should take care of more education than everyone else.
Kolat stressed, "We need to give you a perspective for young people."
However, the director of the Tower Community added that "social supervision within the family" in Germany is much more significant than in France.
Many young people who come from an immigrant family do not want to ruin what their parents have built up here.
Kolat warned, "We must be part of this."
Young people need to make sure that they are able to work and participate in education as soon as possible.
While in Paris, in Williers-le-Bel, the night was full of rest.
Hundreds of police were ready to enter the area with a helicopter lighthouse.
The competent authorities reported on three guards, and some of the suspects and the car.
Since the report, a security unit with 1,000 heads is concerned about the delay.
The police are always ready to intervene until necessary, after the visit of Prime Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie to the city.
During the cold night, 80 police officers were injured in the aftermath of the williers-le-bel riots.
The next night, the ruins were transferred to Toulouse.
The riots were due to a traffic accident that killed two young people on Friday.
According to the State Court's first findings, the police do not require responsibility for the death of young people.
In Angela's office
The fact that the chancellor's action is evidence that coalition is over and there is no hope for it anymore.
Which country does the federal office actually live in?
In the general context of the Bundestag, it must be established after a general and unambiguous action: not here - not in the country where the government would be.
Yes, it was followed by a series of comments from Angela Merkel, who said he would be too focused on foreign policy.
It was provincial, he answered, and in this way he was just saying that he didn't want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Association of the Society, he made it clear to everyone how many eyeglasses are found.
At the same time, no particular interest or empathy was felt about the country's problems.
On the contrary, High Commissioner Angela is a politician who has been driven from reality to foreign policy, and there is no proof of it.
Examples of climate protection: The Heilingendamikam Decision does not judge itself, however, how to achieve climate goals in the country.
At the same time, with regard to the appeal, the President of the CDU would not have allowed such a level of intolerance for two years before.
Now it's possible for the phrase to have a positive effect on the prosthesis from people.
With this, the good news was purchased as a pragmatic personality, which replaced vocabulary with solutions to problems.
However, in Angela's senior office, internal political problems are only a few things.
The problems of poverty and low income?
It's just a couple of minutes worth of it.
Much is said about how hard it is to follow language when it comes to family weddings.
Three times, Merkel has to force him to bring up a more detailed statement.
If it's about concrete, it's in foreign fields.
Roham Attorney General
The Republican president's debate on the issue raised in Youtube has led to a difficult exchange between Rudy Giulani and Mitt Romney - and must now be held by an external mark.
The identity of the characters has already been deleted on the first topic.
As Romney turns against him, Rudy Giuliani has made New York "for the sake of illegal immigrants."
In contrast to the serious facts of his own part, "I would say that his own house serves illegal immigrants," Giulani returns to the former governor of Massachusetts as an independent person.
The candidates go to roham: Since the Republican team still has no uniformly supported favour, the eight President-in-Office will use the question raised in CNN in front of all to undermine its credibility.
Internet users send their own 30 seconds of video broadcast through YouTube almost more than short summaries.
"We have come to Hitler's power with the type of insulationism," John McCain says under the opposition, Ron Paul, who follows the immediate departure from Iraq alone from Iraq.
Romney's head is also firmly rooted in Vietnam's edge when it comes to the use of the so-called "Waterboarding", the method of listening that stimulates the flow of water.
That the campaign's important topics are still being raised in Iraq and the persecutions, the reactions of the Florida public in St. Petersburg are shown.
Hangos breaks out in the area when reducing the conservation values and avoiding future tax cuts.
At the same time, the weaknesses of the two signs will be further shown.
"I went to Akhori," says Romany in a crime scene and apologize before the supporters and television viewers because in 1994 he was still in the middle of pregnancy.
On the other hand, Giuliani is moved to express his opinion on the meaning of the Bible’s words.
Musharraf first Governor as a civilian
One day after his return from military service, he was arrested in Pakistan for his arrest as President Musharraf.
This is the end of eight years of military war in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan has been briefed on the appointment of Pervez Musharraf for a further five-year term of office.
Pakistan's television from the capital, the Israeli president's palace, has brought the ceremony to its attention.
Musharraf has appealed to the Constitution, and he's doing good to his people.
She handed over her trusted military commander, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed the international pressure from the United States first.
After eight years of incarceration, the former tribunals are the first to take over the power of military puks as a civilian state.
Musharraf has done enough to pursue peace and opposition as a major threat to the armed forces.
Further important requirement is the cancellation of the state of emergency issued by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Major General Malik Muhammad Qayum, Musharraf will no longer be able to eliminate the exceptional situation that makes the Nyuga more demanding.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf, held sympathetic rights with him in early November following the declaration of the state of emergency, refused every objection to the re-election of the State on 6 October last week.
At the time, in the northern part of the country, he lost five soldiers and four more wounded in the aftermath of a military coup in North Washington.
According to the information provided by the military commander, the bomb was on its way to the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's dads are coming back.
You were once again a German superhero in the West: Harmonia's three bandits replayed his voice until the beginning of a Berlin concert.
With the reconnaissance of the reconnaissance of the lights, the "Live 1974" represents a desired reception.
They were better known abroad at the time.
The notified sensation killed three of the agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
First of all, he has his own voice, his own pen, and before everyone.
Dieter Moebius is the 63-year-old whore in the middle of the train.
On the other hand, young Michael Rother, who is 57 years old, has been experimenting with a laptop and guitar.
The public is looking better at 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodelius and concentrates on the console.
All of us are producing some kind of sound, including one-time rhythm.
And sometimes it's like a traditional song.
However, it does not seem to bother you in any particular way.
It was a great surprise to the fans of the Krautrock music that the Harmonia would be back together.
What we can say here is that as a result of a follow-up procedure, we can determine that the name was transferred to the collective memory, but in no case did there be any remaining studies to make this band suffer painfully after 32 years.
But why can't I celebrate the lives of the Germans for years?
Most importantly, what we call crooks in England and America has always been valued more than in their own home.
When the song was shared by the members of the Kölni Can who were still alive in 2003, Echo's life-threatening face was sitting on the ground with the German pop shapes.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers were released at La Düsseldorf and the New!, he also said thank you, the surprise would be infinite.
At the concerts, Michael Rother played as an ex-Cymbolist with Red Hot Chili Peppers on his stage.
Homelessness and foreign acceptance are at the same time two sides.
The memory is just too much for Harmonia because the trio has only existed for two years, and during this time, it has been less effective than others have ever owned it.
Moebius and Rodeellius had previously played with Conrad Schnitzler under the name of a great many promising cluster.
At first, they played at the piano under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, an agricultural company financed by the church from economic considerations.
For a short time, Rother is helping the Kraftwerk together, and in this parallel it is perhaps the most graceful German band, the brand of you bought as the Neu! guitar.
In the late 1973 ’ s, however, Rother followed the cluster music in the Weserberglandi Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th - century Roman city as a communist.
Less ideologies than in the I.D. community, where Rodedelius was still a babysitter.
Our life is more like an idyllic art.
The Harmonia Ottenstein Dalarda castle, which was originally from his eyes, was named after their art.
Some of these things have been settled by Harmonia.
The first album titled "Music von Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Despite the song of the laza and his beloved, he also suffered material needs.
The collection didn't ensure that we found ourselves alone.
The "Live 1974" CD was held in a concert held in Greece, before a total of almost 50 recorded audiences, so someone remembers.
The Harmonia rape and sometimes practice was the idea of Rother.
Roedelius and Moebius, this is a request for a bribe.
The band reported a breakdown in 1975.
Rother was tied out of his esoteric and held himself as the Flammere Herzen album.
Cluster was restored in the eightties, which has been more successful since then than the Harmonica has ever been.
Thanks to the Greek live album Herbert Grönemeyer.
His audience, known as Greenland, was going to fire to take care of the Krauttock as his own German contribution to his life.
In this context, Neu! has already been presented in the same way as Roedelius’s speech.
The harmony of the Berlin Cultures is being established in the House.
In cash, under the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is also the author of the manual entitled "Krautrock Sampler" by British scholars.
There's also Dr. Motte's dreamer Loveparade.
It's all about the effect of creatock on the next popzee season.
In this regard, the Harmonia paid off the superheroe's position.
Brian Eno's conclusion goes along with the most common sound in the space: "The only true song, it's the future."
There are no pictures of the product with Harmonia in a parachute room.
Further black-white photographs made of hair dyeing equipment serve as the foundation building.
Before that, it will be re-examined with improvisation.
This only makes it so much so that microphones are fixed to the organ and to the brain by means of the instruments that have not yet heard sound effects from their own organs.
Today's an electric sound.
Three, you're deep in technology.
Not even the housewife has changed anything.
Barbara Morgenstern is under the leadership of the band and kisses and sings "Aaaaaaah!" in a beautiful part.
Because the crouttrick was always very angular to me.
He never talked about rock.
The children were less sought in blue than in the major music schools (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in front of the cultural and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here throws '68' away, he's not going in the wrong way, and the Harmonia doesn't even let himself out of peace now.
Even the most valuable thing you can do is think about the stage.
Where's the music going, and where's it going?
This can easily lead to a person, or it can be provided with moments of exceptional happiness.
Richard Gere simply isn't Chinese enough
Two films are replayed through "The War" and "Mörderischer Frieden" with the Balkan war.
But not one of them is convincing.
The basic idea or too much for action and shooting, or too sensitive.
You don't even help Richard Gere in the "Blood."
First of all, the good news is: Although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, still there, they have found him again in the dark country behind the Bosnian war, in the cinema, Richard Gere.
In recent years, we have lost the best man of eight years, since the role of a number of women's sensitive films and a number of press conferences on Buddhism have also been taken from our taste to rape.
And then, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most interesting thing we can do, so maybe we can still look at the "Blood" film c.
Wonderful, refreshing design: Based on Simon Hunt's design, the filmist is what Gere would have become if the band and filmmaker were not so strong: A man who had left his most years behind, but his painting as a romantic memory has still preserved a significant part of his once-popular beauty.
However, despite the production of "Mörderischer Frieden", which began to run this week, the film and level of the "Balcan War" alone continues to be a series of silent movies.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" should not be lost much: The film about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who have saved a woman from the Kosovo doctors, and one of them loves her as one of them as an unsatisfied guest.
While it is commendable that now the organs are not depicted as all the bad reasons alone, a film that promotes the ability of TV shows is too quick to take place in shooting and events.
"Cobra 11" member, instead of war.
In this context, it is possible to examine for the "Courage" for example, because there has not yet been one really good film on the Balkan war.
The three U.S. reporters' history, who are struggling to explore the war capital of the "Róka" by the Serbian audience, with another director, with another businessman (both in Richard Shepard's personal pool) may have become a new "Apocalypsian now".
Because history shows an amazing similarity: in both cases small groups tend to the forest to end what the soldier is unable to do - and in both cases it is necessary to travel in a crazy place.
One of the reasons why Simon Hunt is simply not allowing his heart to be as kinetic as he first introduced him.
No, and, as a result of the book of commerce, he also spent a romantic relationship with a Muslim woman who was later murdered.
The "Court" will end when the reporters receive what Nato, CIA and all the world have not been able to achieve for five years: they will take the war crime and deliver it to the Mohamedan bunnies for the true purpose of the evil.
This is so bad that a person would be more likely to turn to the Hague International Assembly for crimes against the logic of the music.
And the film aims to be a deep human.
It is appropriate to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and thus suspects the Americans and the French (which is still very, very, extremely united) that they do not continue in the process because of secret political issues.
But good and bad are sometimes so similar to one another that people get a famous Brecht verse in their pockets.
This translator writes the following about thefamas of the Asian demon found in the writing: "In the face of fear of death, it explains what is bad for the farmer."
Films such as the "Creation" have the same human-form masks that show how beautiful they are to be.
This problem is not limited to the operation of movies about the Balkan war.
It was recently announced in the news that all the Hollywood, Iraq, film was so loud.
We can add: You haven't even had a good movie about South Africa yet.
I'm just always right: If a star is stuck in the world's crises or akanamites, then it's like "The heritage of freedom" with Patricia Arquette, with Angelina Jolie or "Verres Child" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are too close to time.
Because they had to take away for decades while Hollywood was able to get a good movie from the holocaust with the "Schindler List" film.
Some films are probably still being played - because today, about the Vietnamese war, the classics, such as "The Snare", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated in their own time as the same artist.
But it can be imagined that when all mass murder is real in time, two real pictures come to our home, just too much about the world's conflicts.
And this prevents books from ignoring the truth that should be needed to tell good stories.
Because at the end of the "Lenny or not" or "The dictator" were successful because Lubitch and Chaplin didn't even know how terrible the Nazi war was really.
Maybe you don't have the right to do the right thing if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we should put Lawrence Norfolk, the queen-in-law, into a very far-reaching artistic view.
When the historical region called "The Lemprière-lexicon" and the conflict between the Balkan war, he replied, "It's just that certain things never change.
The big cities will always be extremely dangerous, people will always be killed in a decent way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beustot is being critical of the Olympics
The determination of the mayor of Hamburg to organize the Olympic Games has changed a series of strong criticisms in political and economic life.
Many still want to fight to organize the water games.
However, Von Beust clearly warned of the realities during the event.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of Hamburg's Business Kamara, described the return as "unfavourable to the economic environment".
No other project has ever released powerful motivational forces in the city in recent times than the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective we could not maintain the political situation of sport."
Schmidt-Trenz referred to the mission not to launch the project, but to work on a long-term initiative, "which starts from modified time coordinates".
Ole von Beust, former mayor of the city of Ole, said that the ambitions of the Olympic Games in Hamburg are not at least 2028.
"Hamburg did not decide on the Olympic bid, but on the German Olympic Sports Association," declared von Beust to the WELT Online.
The decision was rejected by the Association of Sport at the beginning of December on the offer of the 2018 Olympic Games.
"To this end, our participation means so much that our general opinion is not real in the 2028s."
However, we're not finally giving up the dream, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) has resolved its complaint against von Beust's comments.
This led to the impression that Hamburg does not intend to play Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to launch an opportunity to abandon our plans now," said Günter Ploß, president of the HSB.
The request was rejected by the President of the Senate in his statement of approval of the General German High School Sports Centre.
There, Von Beust Hamburg, the same proposal submitted to the University of Hamburg in 2015, indicated that it was not serving as a poet of the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The University of Sport has only started last week as a candidate city in Hamburg.
The SPD's civil group told the senator that he had left a valuable time to build the hamburger.
"Kleiener Grasbrook's development has been slowing down for decades because he lived with the Olympics and prevented the construction of the apartment," declared two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued its launch for the Kleiner Grasbrooks with an integrated plan for the Olympics and the later accommodation destination, the CDU put the sound at the "ememony factor" on one side.
The 2012 bid for the 2012 Olympic Games has changed significantly in Hamburg at the time.
However, he went to Hamburg Lipcs.
They're not Warhol's feet.
The one that connects Sweden and the rest of the world with each other, Ikea, and you don't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently produced in Sweden, black coins are used to register Warhol's works.
This listed nine-year-old "Stockholm type" Brillo Box is a lot of fake.
After a couple of months of doubt about the originality of Andy Warhol of the 1968 Brillo Boxain, the result of the internal investigation of the stockholm Moderna Museum came to an end: The Pontus Hultén, a former museum director of the Moderna Museum, in 1995, was awarded the sixth "Brillo Box" second - and with a great probability of hundreds more "Stockholm type" box on the international market.
The long and complex, artistic and curatorial patterns of the past are a mess.
Warhol started his first "Brillo Boxait" in New York in 1964 - a piece of paper based on the "Brillo" hatboard of the "Brillo" cupboard.
In an exhibition held in Moderna Museet in 1968, hundreds of Brillo cards prepared from Waron were set up: They were not produced from Warhol, but directly from the Brillo Carton Tower.
It wasn't about works, it was about soap operas, it was a simple showbook.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission to sell some Brillo-Flade in Sweden, which was not established in the Moderna Museum.
The modern witnesses are now talking about a village that is now believed to be the original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box, which is right under the "Stockholm-type" of art and commerce.
Some of them were sold for over 100,000 dollars.
The problem is, however, that Pontus Hultén, the late Polish director of the museum, has falsely argued that in 1968 hundreds of frauds were created and set up in Sweden, which he then left Warhol.
In fact, the 105th floor of Hultén was created in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this point, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the Moderna Museum's main artist, also examined a box with six private stores owned by Brillo Box, two of which were produced in Stockholm in 1968: the printed shopping malls were first laid down and destroyed, after which they bought white olive oil.
In contrast to the structure of the others from 1990 it is estimated that the paintings were printed directly on the market sheet, not on oil, but on acrylic sheet.
"The artists did not accept these gifts, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxains," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museum, "unless the New York's 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' has not decided otherwise, the Moderna Museet will be listed as a second/lasting material in its collection."
The Authentication Board, of course, has already reported that later in June, in connection with sappanporos, they have grown "serious charges".
Since then, however, they have become unreceptive.
Manilai's fading soldiers
In the Fülöp Islands, the soldiers who had been shot in a manic hotel and demanded that Gloria Macapagal Arroyo be killed.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, he announced to the chief of the hotel, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election.
The hotel was visited by soldiers who had previously made it easy to enter the government.
Two thousand soldiers spent hours at the building.
The group's party was in court before the trial in 2003 because of the rape investigation - including Trillanes.
She used the treatment to pass them immediately with 30 sympathies.
The military police responsible for the man's custody evidently transferred him to and joined in the singing.
She was taken to the Peninsula Hotel, and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was ordered to arrest President Arroyo.
