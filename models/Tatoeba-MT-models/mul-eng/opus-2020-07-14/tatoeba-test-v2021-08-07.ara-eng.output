We're not used to doing that.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter what you say, but what you do.
That's not what I wanted to tell you about.
There is no doubt that Islam is an integral part of America. America believes that it represents our common aspirations, regardless of race, religion or social position: it is the hope of living in peace, security, access to education, honor, and expression of love for our families and our societies as well as for our Lord. This is our common role, and it is also the hope of mankind to gather together.
