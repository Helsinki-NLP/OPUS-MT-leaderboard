Cumulative rapid progression of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
On the basis of Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and UTIs should prepare more for an outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of unknown etiology pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported the cause agent as being a new coronavirus, now referred to as Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called COVID-19.
The evidence until now is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolved into a more serious disease, demanding hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases evolved into a critical disease, demanding intensive treatment.
The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/Economic Space (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them to those of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 was geographically spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
On 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, in accordance with the WHO definition of case.
In the EU/EEE, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 have already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, which, between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of cases reported by COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the Countries, the national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8h.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them with Italy.
As an approach to the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported from each country until 15 March 2020 to 8h, and compared with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The trends in the cumulative cumulative incidence of 14-day cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in general followed those of the Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by 21 February and significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed trends similar to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases in Italy for 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases notified by COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that pandemics are advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This happens although countries are at different stages, from changes in the actions of the national public health systems and possibly from different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including an update test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on inhalation by cases of COVID-19 in a hospital and/or in an ITU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data with focus in the number of reported cases and in the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ITU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100 thousand people.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 ITU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100 thousand inhabitants between 2010 and 2011.
Modelling scenarios relating to the satisfaction of the health system, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a 90 % risk of intensive treatment milk capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Given that cases have so far concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, hospitals and intensive treatment units generally accept a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available in the Nomenclature of the Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and the trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and UTIs should therefore prepare for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, especially intensive treatment, as is done in the affected regions of Italy.
According to the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a rapid, pro-active and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the content approach for a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions adequately if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures for mitigating the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small opportunity window during which countries have the opportunity to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, it is likely that other EU/EEA health systems have a source of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The disease of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80 thousand in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a disaster for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted to the muscles and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, the COVID-19 has less gravity and mortality than the SARS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older than the young, and men more than the women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive evaluation of the research object, which is rapidly developing.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study helps to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were obliged to be confined to the whole wound and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is similar to the Coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease was called CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80 thousand confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40 thousand recovered patients and more than 3 thousand dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one" and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nej.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to sum up the research progress in this new area of rapid development.
If relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic of 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and forecasting of disease, as well as the other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold.
Meanwhile, in this century, we have found two times highly pathogenic human coVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with morbidity and death threatening.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CV epidemic in the documented history of human being.
According to Figure 1.1.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origin was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CV sequence was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the content of health professionals was communicated, suggesting that transmission among people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with only 21 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan sea fruit market, which was considered the starting point of the disease by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until the moment of this report, disease has already spread across China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Figure.2).
As the situation gets worse quickly, the size and the final severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centres with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age range from 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years of age, some were less than 20 years old, and only 14 were infected were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/1000) than women (0.27/1000).
COVID-19 was promoted in groups, mainly in Hubei and around it.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2-9 days for diagnosis based on the presence of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean meal time based on the appearance of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the time of mass transport before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 144% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (masculin), age (more than 60 years old) and severe pneumonia.
The CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single RNA string with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genders, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and betaconavir are known to affect human beings.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope connects its cell receptors to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and the fusion of membranes occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released in cytoplasma; after replication of the viral gene, the genomic RNA is accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleop acid proteins in the form of vesicles containing viruses, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same source in the south, the Huan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the electronic transmission microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the epithelial of human aircraft.
Human ECA2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S protein S of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human protein ECA2 in a weaker way than SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secret protein coded by orf8.
The ORf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNb; however, the Orf8 does not contain any known domain or function.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the ECA2 human creao-EM structure of a total of 2,9 Å resolution in a complex with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed compliances, was grouped as a counter, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex may combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for the treatment of medicinal products to remove infection by SARS-CoV-2.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were born of pigs and were transmitted to human beings through ropes and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coVs, the males were considered to be the native guests of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two coVs similar to the SARS named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the species barrier and infect human beings remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that cobs carry the virus of the musculoskeletal to human beings, which involved a homologous combination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-term phosphinins that are used frequently in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosters of SARS-CoV-2, based on genetic homology of 99% between a coV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, final results for concrete tests are expected (Figure 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are, in most cases, still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with a moisture content of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 can have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroformium and other organic solvents, but not chlorethidine, are effective in the deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported in relation to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognised by the immune system of the host by means of standard recognition receivers (PRRs), including readers of type C, Toll type receptor (TLR), NOD type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the growth of dendritic cells and the synthesis of interferons of type I (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and speed up macrophasis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joined in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in the defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells kill directly the cells infected by the virus.
Collaboration T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, the CV may inhibit the functions of T cells by induceing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the METS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to lungs and other organs and, worse than the hypotheses, multiple failure of the organs, and even death.
The infection by SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the presence of symptoms in a group of people, affects older people with comarbities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days and, in most cases, from 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and varied from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographic of 8.866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective time of quarantine based on the most precise period of incubation, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmission the virus to others.
As current practice, individuals exposed to the virus or infected by it usually have to stay in a quarantine for 14 days.
Should the period of forty-four be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, throat pain, corrosion, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the symptoms of the disease appeared.
In serious cases, patients rapidly evolved to a acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the lung image diagnosis, should undergo treatment for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that transmits an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilator support, much more than patients in COVID-19, which consists of the greater mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, when the cases confirmed in the world reached 66,576.
Similarly, the mortality of SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8.096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A recent study reported that the basic number of reproduction R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71 to 7.23 while the R0 of SARS-CoV varied from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in relation to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than those last two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle as a cruise ship.
Patients usually provide history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact individuals or patients infected in the previous two weeks with symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and patients who received high hospital patients can re-examine the virus, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white globulin count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were observed in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscle and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimero-D, a product of fibrine degradation present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was progressive reduction.
In most patients with COVID-19, abnormality in torax radiographics are present, and present bilateral irregular shadows or opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed an atypical pneumonia, acute damage to lungs and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of fluids and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumonia decreases the surface level and increases the surface tension, thus reducing lung capacity, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapsing.
Therefore, the most serious results of torax radiation generally correspond to the most serious form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decommissioning of pneumatics, the formation of hyalinine membranes, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sysic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative errors, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which occurred not only from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to achieve an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol to use the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments from SARS-CoV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per input microlitre) using a measurement variable in less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if checked in clinical samples.
Because of lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors may provide, in the best of their ability, palliative treatment for patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of treatments that were used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressors, steroids, plasma of patients treated, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients recovered was suggested as treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks lungs at the start and probably also attacks at a lower degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the rins.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve the symptoms and save lives, including general oxygenation therapy, high flu oxidation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive oxidation by extracorporate membrane (ECMO), an alternative cardiopulmonary alternative technique used for the treatment of severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine cascade results from the excessive reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a systemic inflammatory response characterised by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNfa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNB, IFNG, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the immune system's cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple failure of the organs.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokines, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include the modulation of immune response to T cells; the blockage of IFN, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; the removal of cytokines signalling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
steroids, such as immunosuppressors, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They may cause serious side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, affecting dramatically the prognostic.
However, short-term treatment periods with corticosteroids at low-moderate doses were recommended for careful use in patients with severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article was written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remDesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remDesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple phyta RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
On this basis, Gilead provided the composition for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after co-administration with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of patients treated and generation of antibodies
The blood collection of patients who have been treated with an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease's contraction has a long history.
In fact, patients treated generally have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 and was injected in 10 patients in severe condition.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, reducing inflammation and viral load, and improving oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of a large scale method before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies may stimulate excess immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is generally low, and plasma demand is great to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of patients treated and identify the genetic codes that code effective antibodies or make a trial for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Chinese Traditional Medicine, MTC, is used thousands of years ago to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to diagnosis of a disease based on MTC theories.
Most of the active components remain unknown, or it is empty, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their best combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapy for COVID-19, MTC became one of the main alternative treatments for patients with brandy or moderate symptoms, or for patients who recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best treatment rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used MTC in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei Province, which used MTC in only 30% of patients with COVID-19, received the lower treatment rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with the western medicine and the combined treatment of the western medicine with the MTC.
It was found that the times needed for recovery of body temperature, for the absence of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the group treated with Western medicine and MTC than in the group treated with Western medicine only.
The lower rate of symptoms (from the severe brands) was significantly lower for the group treated with the Western medicine and MTC than for the group treated only by the Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated with the Western medicine and MTC than in the group treated only with the Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC still await more duly controlled tests at larger and more centres.
It would also be useful to characterise the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of the treatment of the MTC or its combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease feel, in general, a great fear of highly contagious disease which can be fatal, and people in Kerentine also feel lonely, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, various psychiatric disorders, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotropic excitation, psychosis symptoms, delinquency and even suicidal tendencies, were reported.
The tracking of contacts and the mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and tax on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to those suspected of the disease and to those who had contact with them, as well as to the general population, who needed it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and precise updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reserves and infected people for susceptible guests, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop vaccines based on protein S to generate powerful and lasting neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of fatal challenges and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses still need to be determined prior to the initiation of a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic and focus of MERS continues to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonosic sources in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, similar particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, average) needed for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just started to show its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases patients recovered gradually without delay.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to give priority to their services, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.
Based on the clinical studies previously reported, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for SARS' prognostic, which is also worth COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment had greater opportunities to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (meaning 66 years versus 51 years old), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health benefit of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Concomitants and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment have greater opportunities to suffer from acute or arrhythmia.
Cardiovascular episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be combined with positive ECA2 colulocytes, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that underlying age and diseases have a strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognostic of the COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and elevated creatinine quinase (CK) may also help in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressly present in several organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during the tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: torax radiation and transient progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for the prevention of COVID-19 defects/complications.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressors as a combination therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent incapacity and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they pass through long periods of anxiety and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and sustained support to help these patients recover from stress and restore a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is able to react effectively in higher respiratory treatment and does not cause symptoms in the initial phase of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), similar to other coVs that cause common respiratory problems.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial phase or in the incubation period may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are severely ill, with most of the transmissions not happening at the initial phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are being made in China today, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost all the population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have had a dramatic impact on the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the elimination of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends by March, and the phase of deceleration lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other specialists are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., held that COVID-19, which seems to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the outbreaks of garganta and the mean cancer of patients who recovered and received high hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new identified virus can become a cyclic episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising indicators occurred in China on the basis of the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with the quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was maintained under control, by the end.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker than its infectivity and, at some point, becomes a less pathogenic virus with human beings.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is found below (Fig. (Figu.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by cough and breath and, possibly, by direct contact with substances contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in stages, which creates a new possibility: oral-female transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution must be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social assistants, family members, working companions and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluids from being transported into the air or being attached to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of viruses of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and they have approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five single surgical masks, health professionals directly contact patients should use the N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health professionals should use isolation clothes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infected an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his infected eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also use transparent facial protective eyes or eyes when dealing with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than normal, try to stay home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for human beings, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a great warning to China, based on its recent history with SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens, saying that the new virus has low levels of contagion and limited reproductive activity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain disease.
This message left the most relaxed people, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the disease in Wuhan was lost on a minimum scale.
Disease control agencies in China can benefit from this tough lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more careful when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by the citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the inhuman information coming from hospitals instead of waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at their initial stage instead of trying to encourage the public; and (4) to issue more frequently effective direct simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the system of society's response periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, she was scattered throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world at the time of the writing of this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a feeling of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the maintenance of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older than young people, and men more than women, and pregnancy and mortality rates are also higher in older than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, because SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects regions more than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients treated may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in the COVID-19 research, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homologous has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of males similar to SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 has a origin in males.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bear, we say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions Nos 1 and 2, we cannot cut transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 connects to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also connected to ECA2-expression cells in the other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot obtain a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus developing genetically during the transmission of human beings?
She'll become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or have seasonal recurrences, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to find answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the effort required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Sonootic origins of human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation caused the evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and its hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coVs (HCoVs) caused a brand disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) changed what was thought of the CoVs and revealed how much HCoV infection could be fatal and devastating.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 raised the CoVS again and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous use.
Most of the HCoVs originated from the pigs, in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservations of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in human beings.
The investigation of the interactions of the CV host in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenicities of the CV in human beings.
In this study, we have a general view of the information available on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interesting transmission.
An important analysis is that we compare and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the combination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for effective transition between guests and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of virus encapsulated, positive polarity and simple phyta RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobs, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their corroo morphology when observed in electronic microscopy.
As far as the structure is concerned, the CoVs have non-separate genes that share a similar organisation.
About two thirds of the genome contain two surface open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab replication.
Polyproteins are re-transformatted and generate 16 non-structured proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific line accessories are also encoded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified in four genes (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV gene contains most of the HCoVs and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence showed that males and rats serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reserve of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
Until now, seven human coVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory tract infection below a relatively higher number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary events.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the course of patients with common cold in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, and both cause autonomous symptoms.
In fact, the concept that infection by HCoVs is generally indefensive was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of the current and infected more than 8 thousand people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the respiratory syndrome epidemic in the Middle East (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new HCoV of 2019 (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the current disease epidemic of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which took more than 3.120 lives and infected more than 91 thousand people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins in cats, rabbits or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate with the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from the pigs, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and for the rest of the world.
The traceability of the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the stimulating force and the restrictive factors of the migration of virus to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search by the reserve, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we have a general vision of zoonotic origins, interesting transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are usually not pathogenic in their natural reservations, but become pathogenic after the relevant transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of HCoV evolution, in which increased transmissibility has generally been accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Prior to the first insulation of HCoV-229E vaccine in patients with common cold conditions, different CoVs were isolated in several infected animals, including Peru, camdongo, cow, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of HCoV discovery history in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory treatment of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted to growth in pulmonary cells WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, breath, malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in camundong brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are pathogenic to the infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A and renovirs.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperatures.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, accompanied by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected by HCoV-229E developed a common cold brand.
Only a few immunocompressed patients experienced severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in the history of human being, and the ethiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS is remanded in 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread by several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspares", it was estimated that each infected person may contamination approximately two others, with a period of incubation of 4 to 7 days, and with the presence of the viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience headache, headache, fever, malaster and calafrios followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Linfopenia, hepatic dysfunction and high creatinine quinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Dispersion alveolar damage, spread of epithelial cells and increase in the number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients require, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal treatment, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these serious cases, usually with a cytokine cascade, which may be fatal, mainly in immunocompressed patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a parent of a zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of heart, conjunctivitis, fever and bronquiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nasal species of an 8-month-old baby suffering pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered around the world.
It was estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
The HCoV-NL63 is associated with the obstructive laryngitis, also known as a crupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronquiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the pneumonia and bronquiolitis acquired in a Community way, it was reported that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with the exacerbation of the acute asthma.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were found worldwide, causing brand-new respiratory diseases.
All these four acquired Community-wide HCVs have adapted well to human beings and generally have less chance of suffering mutations and causing highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for a rare reason in the case of a more virile subtype of HCV-NL63, which has recently been reported as a cause of severe respiratory tract lower in China.
In general, when these HCovs acquire the ability to be effectively transmitted and to remain in human beings, they also become less viral and less pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases confirmed by the laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread for close contacts were reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
In contrast to SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal insufficiency, which is therefore well peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases by the laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases, of 34.4%, which made MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
Since the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia known to be retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also designated the COVID-19 disease.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that loyalty related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while loyalty outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with fever, cough and dyspneia.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop to the syndrome of acute respiratory discomfort.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped in different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but it is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 were reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals similarities and differences of great relevance.
Firstly, the period of incubation and the duration of the evolution of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is found between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCoVs acquired in a Community way (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are more observed during the infection with HCoVs acquired in a Community way, including the presence of non-specific symptoms, brands or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 may also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting standards, both in the HCoVs acquired in a Community way and in the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to human beings, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way that other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fake samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the golden-feal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, such as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonality, as in the cases of purchased Community-wide HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its passage to human beings, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All HCOVs acquired in a Community way that cause brand-new symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
In another view, it can also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of old HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe human diseases and people who develop severe HCoV diseases were eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCOVs need to re-appropriate in human beings to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restricted factors.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus adapts to human beings.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with the quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four coVs acquired in a Community way have been circling in the human population, causing common cold in immunocompetitive individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, did not adapt well to human beings, and their transmission between human beings cannot be supported.
They need to keep and spread in their zootic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human heights, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifier hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV, MercS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in Community way.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way that HCoVs acquired in a Community way, at least up to now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs obtained in a Community way and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will be fully adapted to human beings and will travel between us without a reserve animal or intermediate host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reserve, intermediate and amplifiers of HCVs.
An animal serves as the evolutional host of a HCoV if it covers a direct relationship antenna, sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
Antistral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
In the same way, a reservation host adheres to the HCoV in a continuous and lasting way.
In both cases, hosters are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is recently inserted into an intermediate host before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to respond in a transparent manner and, then, transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
A HCoV may have the infection interrupted if it cannot support its transmission to the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish a long-term endemicness.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservation host.
Epidemiological data revealed that SARS's zero patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Further studies of sorprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG antiSARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Mascarated palm trees (Pagoma larvata) and a cane-gasin in live animals markets were initially identified as carrying viruses similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was indirectly confirmed by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the destruction of all civilians on the market.
However, it was reported that wild or unexploited palm blossoms were highly negative to SARS-CoV, suggesting that male palm blossoms could only be the amplifier intermediate host, but not the natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as amplifier intermediate hostess of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the SARS-CoV's natural animal host revealed a CV of a close relationship breast, named CoV HKU3 of the Rhinolophus breast cancer associated with SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese breast-fedrum.
These germs are positive for antiSARS-CoV antibodies and for SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequences.
This and other coves share 88% to 92% of homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies have formed the basis for the new concept that infants are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in pigs, but no CoV, with the exception of the designated WIV1, may be isolated as live virus.
It is known that angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) from human beings is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been demonstrated that the WIV1 derived from feces samples used the ECA2 of pigs, bovines and human beings as a receptor for entering the cells.
It is interesting to note that the SARS-convalescent patient's sister was able to neutralize the WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the antistral with closer relationship to SARS-CoV in breast cancer, sharing 95% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that the cats are not the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groupes the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CV-HKU4 and the CV-HKU5 in the molluscs.
CoV-HKU4 of pigs and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, the dipeptidil-pepidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA polymerase sequences are philogenetically closer to the homologous in betaCoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild dogs.
The MercS-CoV and its closest parent, the CoV-HKU25 of the pigs, only 87% of the homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the pigs may not be the immediate reserve host of the MercS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the Driedians are soro-positive for specific neutralization antibodies of the MERS-CoV, the same as Middle East camels in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in human beings, was isolated from the nasal outbreaks of drug addicts, increased evidence that the camels serve as the legitimate reserve host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the symptoms generally branded, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses to infants.
However, there is still a lack of answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the appearance of symptoms, which may be attributed, please, to transmission between persons or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species covering the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a CoV RATG13 of butter, isolated from Rhinolophus afinis molluscs.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is very great to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, the ants may not be the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless CoVs are almost identical to the bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Attack Market, in which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal transmission event to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequence suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also embrace betaCoVs anti-SARS-CoV-2.
These new coVs of pangolim share 85% to 92% of homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RATG13, with about 90% of identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped in virus sublinhagens similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares an area of link to the receptor (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more divergent, although they have a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study of patients with pangolins also reported detection of viral follow-up of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different configuration and manual healing methods to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to approximately 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolim is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal hosts.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 of the Pangolim due to the divergence in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the Pangolins.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
The evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in pigs, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While higher sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 shared the wider genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the betaCoVs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 stems from the convergence evolution mediated by selectivity.
A different argument concerns the combination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an incentive force in evolution, the combination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains in research.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Philogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have been derived from breast-feeding coVs, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rats.
It was reported that an ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor mollusc showed a direct relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another Mortgage CoV, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and it is also suspected that camels are their intermediate guests.
For more clarity, the current knowledge of the known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interesting transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was registered.
The history of interesting transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlfaCoVs of severely related strains related to HCoV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there's an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the virus to humans.
First, human beings, but not alpacas, can have contact with the ants in a shared ecological nest.
On the contrary, human beings have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, alphaCoVs related to HCoV-229E are different and not pathogenic in mice, while alphaCoV of alpacas caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas get alphaCoV related to HCoV-229E from human beings.
In fact, insects are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for human beings, including raiva virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that ants transmit HCoV-229E directly to human beings.
As an alternative, while alphaCoVs serve genetic pools of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dramedians can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to human beings, just as in the case of MercS-CoV.
The MercS-CoV serves as an excellent example of an interesting transmission of dragons for dragons and dragons for human beings.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from the pigs is known in its initial identification and was corroded by subsequent results.
It is obvious that the ants provide a rich pool of viral species for the exchange of interest of genetic fragments and the transmission of interest.
Longevity, colonies with high density, strict social interaction and high flight capacity are all favourable conditions for babies to be the ideal "viral propagger".
On the other hand, the introduction of the MercS-CoV in the Drmediators goes back to decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and has migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable host.
MERS-CoV is a cause of a well-branded disease and supports a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of the camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
In particular, the betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to pipes, in the case of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 animals for human beings have to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, the pigs could be the reserve host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological nest with the ants by means of abbot or coal mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had recently been infected.
Human beings fight the virus through hunting and hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study on antibodies produced from domestic animals and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, according to the above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has been associated with both the fungi and the pangolins.
The search for SARS-CoV-2's animal origins is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal host, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating the species' barrier to the CoVs.
First, your rate of change relatively high in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple flat-rate RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the CoVs can be considered to be "moderate" to "high" with an average rate of substitution of approximately 10-4 substitutes per year, depending on the adaptation phase of the CV to the new hosts.
The CoVs have exorribonuclease with a review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessive metabolism and atenuation, or even invisibility.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue replication of the CV by inhibiting exorriboneclease and RNA polymerase dependent on RNA is eliminated.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the exchange rates of the CoVs are nearly a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the change rate is generally high when the CoVs are not properly adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is low, apparently, which suggests its higher level of adaptation to human beings.
Understandably, he has already adapted to another host who keeps in touch with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the drivers.
theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would rapidly make the vaccines and antivirals resistant to SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the large RNA gene in CoVs performs an extra plasticity in the modification of the gene for mutations and combinations, thus increasing the probability of interesting co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is confirmed by the abundance of single reading frames and protein functions codified in relation to the last three nodes of the genome.
Thirdly, the CoVs exchange random and frequent models during the replication of RNA through a single "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host who serves as a mixture container, the exchange of fats occurs frequently during the transmission of the CV RNA.
Long high homologous and subgenometic RNAs can be combined to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and in HCoV-OC43 and in animal CoVs, as well as in the SL-CoV of the cats and the batCoV-HKU9.
Hospital virus interaction with regard to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor that influences the relevant transmission.
Here, the combination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of the positive selection during relevant transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolates from human and civilian beings, it is believed that SARS-CoV passes through a rapid adaptation to different hosts, mainly with changes in the DLR of protein S.
In general, DLR in protein S of a CV interacts with the cell receptor and is carefully selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318° to 510° in the S1 fragment, which connects to the ECA2 human, as well as its corrections to the viral input.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize the ECA2 receptors of several animals, including pigs, civets, camdongos and caes-gaxinins, allowing the transmission of the virus's interest.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and civets in the DLR, and four of them are located on the ground of contact with the receptor for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of the civets has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the relevance of the interaction of protein spike with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in human beings.
Note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in unit S1 of protein S implies that the relevance of your protein S to human ECA2 may have been changed.
In fact, a study with electronic creamicroscopy indicates a fineness of 10 to 20 times greater than that between the human ECA2 and the SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other correction may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is interesting that HCoV-NL63 also connects to ECA2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminoopeptide N for HCoV-229E and silic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs in human beings after the interesting transmission of their animal guests.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the interesting transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these proteins of the host between human beings and HCoV’s natural reserve hosts such as the molluscs, driers and rotors could constitute a barrier to an interesting transmission.
The HCoVs need to use the dependency factors with the host and subversive the restrictions on the host for an effective interesting transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of the host virus interaction still need to be identified and characterised.
A non-intensive trial with the extent to which the host's dependence level and restricted factors for SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR's modern technology can produce good results.
New HCoVs suggestion: back to zero stack
The diversity of the CVs of molluscs provides a wide range of possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the male coVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV's additional proteins, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since SARS-CoV-related morticians were isolated, but it was found that they codify different ORF8 proteins.
A feature of the exclusion of nucleotide 29 of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated branches at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive change that promotes the alternateness of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible historical combination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lines, where a large number of smaller combination regions were identified in RNA polymerase RNA dependent.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
In the same way, it was demonstrated that the epidemiological MERS-CoV passed through recombination events between different lines, which took place in Drmediators in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs are combined with other animal coVs in their non-structured species.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genes, likely resulting from the relief of the selection pressure exercised on viruses, such as the pressure of the host's immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype cap of HCoV-229E due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While the ORF4 intact can be observed in male and female viruses related to HCoV-229E, alphaCoV of alpacas presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a change in the tables.
Finally, but not least important, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reserve hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in rats when they were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and mice.
It is likely that the mussels are well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflamatory response in infants effectively reduce the pathology produced by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural terminal cells in mice is removed due to the adaptation of the inhibitor of NKG2/CD94 natural terminal cells, and the low degree of expression of Class I molecules of the main Histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive species of oxygen (ERO) generated from the high metabolic activity of the molluscs can delete the replication of the CoV as to affect the revision by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic viruses when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CV could also develop by combination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not the case that three new HCoVs arose in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic, or cause, at most, branding symptoms in their reserved guests, such as cats and camels.
They are deeply replayed without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations about the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases of human infection.
Serious symptoms are primarily due to hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine cascat, where the greater the immune response, the more serious is the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disabled from the replication of the CV.
The same immunodeficiency strategy could have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in cats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at the initial stage of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in human beings should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in the muscles is inadequate.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles as those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
As it has been discovered that the betaCoV of the molluscs shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a CV of molluscs that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been discovered that civilians and other animals on the market commit identical viruses to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts to SARS-CoV-2 were not identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments for the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by an accidental or intentional man.
The CoVs returned to the world attention due to the recent epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of the CoVs in cats and other animals has dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservations of HCoVs in the transmission of human beings.
Evidence of wide dissemination shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have origin in the womb and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from the contact between human beings and civilians on the markets, the closure of the markets and the slaughter of civilians on these markets could have brought an end to the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, Pangolins should be removed from the U.S. markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to human beings through pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dormitory for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and they are an essential source of meat, milk, hair and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels for the control of MERS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic coVs circle in nature.
In particular, the coVs of molluscs with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and combine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or light to human beings in the future.
The culture of feeding wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS crisis, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until there is a chance of migration for another species.
Although insects have many characteristics that promote the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with insects and other wild species can be minimised if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continual surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the environment of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be shown to be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to human beings and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is that people stay away from the ecological nests of natural zoonoses.
Several parts of SARS-CoV-2's zoonotic origin are still missing.
First, if the ants transmit an anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-virus to the pangolins, it is important to find out that under circumstances the molluscs and pangolins could share the same ecological nest.
Secondly, if the ants play a more direct role in the transmission of human beings, it should be determined how people get in touch with the ants.
Thirdly, if a third parent has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including human beings, mammals and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bear, a pangolim or other mammals, it is expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are identified in their future natural hosts.
Continued research in this area will highlight the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in human beings.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "supposed case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide for diagnosis and treatment of the infection of the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This guide transmits our experience and is a good reference to combat this global pandemic.
However, the disease of the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of ongoing findings of clinical studies and experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "sustained case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic Guides and Treatment (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially designated as the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus is called Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guide published online at Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
He has drawn excellent attention from the publication.
However, it notes that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of ongoing findings of clinical studies and experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the Guidelines on Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.hc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 contain a total of seven editions with substantive changes in the context of some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., which presented a simple score proposal based on its clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We started their meaningful work and expressed our gratitude.
However, your work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic Guides and Treatment (seven test version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to carry out an extensive analysis, or three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms originating in the city of Wuhan and nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (more or equal to two cases with fever and/or symphrines; (3) a history of cases of cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or symptoms originating in the city of Wuhan; and CVID-19 cases where cases were reported in the last days prior to the presence of symptoms; (4) a history of cases of cases of cases of cases (more or equal to two cases of fever; 2 cases of fever, and/or symphrigues).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic resources in the image of infection by COVID-19; (3) total white blood globulin count showing normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case shall be based on suspects with any of the sorological or pathogenic elements as follows: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genom sequence showing high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for the IgM and IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in the soror test; or any change in the IgG specific IgG body for SARS-CoV-2 positive for a positive or increased title greater or greater than four times in the above recovery phase of the acute phase.
We can note that the PCR test in real time for nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory treatment was added to the second and third edition (from 18 and 22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic detection of the blood sample was added to the fourth and fifth edition (from 27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the sorological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal nuclear acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and samples of respiratory treatment, including blood sample, which increased the availability of different species and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us of being alert to symptoms and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al. flugram should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be checked in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we await the rise of more direct evidence and ask the readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "sustained case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they verify and obey the latest guidelines from their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, greater daily number
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in the day.
That's the largest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 dead were registered.
In an online reporter, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital agent told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maite Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video on-line communication, Bengal Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be paralyzed for more time than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport began on 26 March and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical, fuel and food products) was still permitted.
The first incidents of infection by COVID-19 in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On 19 March, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Friday, the total number of cases of infections by the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus worldwide exceeded one million, reported data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
This framework came the same day that Malawi confirmed its first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had its first death related to the virus.
North Korea stated that, by Friday, it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases 24 hours before 10 a.m. in the Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States due to coronavirus infections on Thursday.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Friday, Moscow's predecessor Sergei Sobayin extended the city's total blockade until 1 May.
In the national sphere, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without comparability to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the national emergency status for 15 days, and the vote was adopted by 215 votes to ten with ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended for the whole day the length of the tok to collect in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this period was only from 15 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand Plan to implement the collection rate from 22h to 4h
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until 1 May.
Stores in Australia reduce the thresholds of hygienic paper by transaction
On Saturday and Sunday evening, the Australian stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the purchase restrictions on the purchase of hygienic paper, respectively, for two packages and a transaction package in all the shops of the country.
On Tuesday, ALDI also implemented a limit of a package.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of the COVID-19, buyers were supposed to be stoking if there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Thursday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of hygienic paper with delivery at home for a package per request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Cole, in his press note of 8 March, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still breaking the stocks in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "no prior", while ALDI called it "unexpected" on a Facebook post on Wednesday.
Sales had an "accented increase" last week, according to a Woolworths voice.
Costco's store in Chamber also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
In order to ease the gap further, Cole ordered larger packages of suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI previously made stocks of a planned promotion for the fourth quarter.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Variety Association, said that Varietyists are trying to increase stocks, but that restrictions on the local union in relation to the frequency of delivery by road are difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and less promotions.
On the third day, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the promotion of Thursday.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a specialist at the University of Queensland Technology, said the stores stop the store all night long.
He pointed out that the hygienic role is a volumeal item with low stock numbers in terms of quantity, and that, when lost, it leaves many empty spaces in the windows, increasing the feeling of loss.
Colles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there were a lot in the dishes, if produced as roles of hygienic and antisceptic roles could be [compared] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, said Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The recyclable hygienic paper manufacturer Who Gives the Crap said on the last Thursday that they would be free of charge.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces Klenex's hygienic role, and Solaris Paper, who produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to news.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free hygienic paper to the first bidders in Melbourne, when fewer leases were being made with buyers coming in at the end of the long week of work.
The edition of the NT News, a daily print by Darwin, included an insert of eight pages with the aim of being reproduced and used as a hygienic paper.
At first, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on 3 March in which they said they did not have plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also with high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, soap for hands and hair.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Octado limited purchases of the Andres hygienic paper to two packs of 12 roles.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current source of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to motivate governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize the population for a response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said.
We are very concerned about alarming levels of dispersion and severity and alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Control and Disease Prevention Centres, is a "unforeseen pandemic".
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "without influence, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from emerging to continuous global dispersion".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we've never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And he continued, "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the decision of January of the WHO to declare the source a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the sudden, "in sum, will worse".
On Friday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 is a continuous disease pandemic by Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome severe 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The drought was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It is estimated that the mortality rate is 4% in China, while overall ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to the start of symptoms is approximately five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
No specific vaccine or antiviral treatment is known.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended prevention measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth with tossing, keeping people away and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities of the whole world responded to the implementation of travel restrictions, 40, collection take-offs, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic interruptions, the addition or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the generalized lack of excess supplies by the purchases produced by the panic.
Schools and universities closed the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the student population in the world.
The disinformation about the virus was spread online and there were incidents of xenophobic and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance from the east and Southeast Asia and other people in areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to the reduction of travel and the closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cases on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In most cases, the cases were linked to the attacker market in the Huanan Sea and therefore it is believed that the virus has zoonotic origin.
The root virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close links to the coronaviruses of the moss, of the pangolim and of the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms that he has knowledge adopted on 1 December 2019 and did not have visible connections with the post-market group of sea fruit.
The initial group of cases reported in December 2019 found that two thirds had a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case referred to 17 November 2019, in an individual 55 years of the province of Hubei, which may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but mainly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant subnotification of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of the cases worldwide. The main scientific consultant in the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, believed that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of persons tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive in accordance with the official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not only to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovered.
For those who do not recover, the time from the appearance of symptoms until death has been between 6 and 41 days, 14 days is the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 dead were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, approximately 80% of the deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had preexisting medical conditions, including cardiovascular and diabetes. The official death count by the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to those who died and had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having done the test, for example, who died at home, in rest houses, etc.
Italy's partial data showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of deaths by COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A poll from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement sponsored by subnotification epidemiological reports in the United States. This sub-assembly occurs in pandemics, such as the Swedish influenza epidemic H1N1 in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death out of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death out of Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been registered in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except in Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and the length of time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the beginning and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The mortality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the estimate of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with symptoms at the beginning of 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms at the beginning of February 1, 2020). Other measures include the rate of lethality (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and the rate of lethality of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnostic and non-diagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific population of infection through the case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Medicine Based on Evidence at Oxford University estimates that the rate of fatality of infection for the pandemic, in general, is between 0.1% and 0.33%.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that pandemics can be controlled.
The peak and maximum output duration are uncertain and can change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, of the State University of Pennsylvania, said that, "without due control, infectious epidemics usually reach their age and then enter a decline when there are no more guests available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when that will happen."
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, defended that "may end by June" if all countries are mobilized to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the University of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine of London, stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue in circulation for a year or two".
According to the study of the Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (probably in 18 months or more).
William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, as it's highly transmitted" and "that can become a seasonal disease, coming back every year."
The recurrence virus will depend on the immunity of the group and the extension of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively specific and the infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry tissue (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion (catharro), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and articular pain, throat pain, headaches, vomiting, hemopathic, diarrhoea or cianosis. WHO claims that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is recommended to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, severe respiratory disorder syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests confirming the infection, researchers therefore recommend that those who were in close contact with a confirmed infection should be monitored and examined closely to clear the infection.
The Chinese estimate of asymptomatic reason varies from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the beginning of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but normally it is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is mainly spread by the next contact and by small Gothiques produced during the act of tossing, breathing or speaking, while the next contact is considered to be 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that tossing without covering the mouth can make the rubbers reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by gothics that remain for longer periods of time in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Respiration Gothicles may also be produced during the experiment, including speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
Gothiques can be put in the mouth and noses of nearby people or, possibly, they will be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubate and cardiopulmonary reanimation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretion, resulting in air dispersion.
The spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his own eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that the facts can be exposed, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The Chinese government took advantage of the opportunity to transmit SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms arise, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for disease up to three days before symptoms arise, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, a person is generally infected by two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in paper and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Animals of estimation and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronavirus related to its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by domestic sand, which dissolves its protective environment. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
Believe it's a zootic origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the gener Betacoronavirus, subgenero Sarbecovirus (line B). Two branches of this same line are derived from worms.
It has 96% similar, throughout the genome level, the other samples of coronavirus sold by molluscs (BatCoV RATG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genotype sequences between the pangolin virus and the human.
The comparison of the whole genome has so far found, at the maximum, 92% of genetic material sharing between the pangolim coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The infection with the virus may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. The final confirmation, however, is the reverse transcription followed by a polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computerized tomography (TC).
A study conducted in Wuhan, comparing RRT-PCR to TC suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive, although it is less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching other pneumonies and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the TC is not used for selection or as a front line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available from a few hours a day.
In general, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal cold, although the garganta cold is also used. Various laboratories and companies are developing serologic tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these were sufficiently necessary to be approved for generalised use.
A serologic test developed by Cellex, in the United States. was approved to be used as emergency only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of computerized radiographics and tomography (TC) images of symptomatic people include eye-opening asymmetric peripherals and absence of pulmonary waste.
The Italian Radiological Society is bringing together an international database on-line image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overposition with other infections such as adenovirus, images without confirmation by PCR are limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared TC to PCR results and demonstrated that, although the image is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as an epidemiological research tool.
Convulsive neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus's images with radiographics and TCs.
The strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining a good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose or mouth without washing hands, tossing or breathing in a paper chain and placing this link directly on a waste container.
It is advised who has been infected to use a public surgical mask.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or unconstructed non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by drought.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of Community spread in many regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how it was infected. Health professionals who care for individuals who may be infected with standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection are recommended. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use of localization data governments from cells for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with the International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations issuing a declaration requesting limits to this type of surveillance.
Several cell applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of specialists are working in friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user in relation to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for the COVID-19. Some wrong concepts about how to prevent infection have been circulated, such as touching the nose and loading with collutors, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and know for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are obviously soft. Also wash your hands before eating and after drying the nose, tossing or breathing.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus is killed by domestic sand, which breaks its protective layer.
The CDC also recommends the use of hand hygiene based on alcohol with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when there is no soap and water available immediately.
WHO advises to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (in up to one minute exposure to the disinfectant for an stainless steel surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropyl alcohol to 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite to 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide to 0.5% and iodopovidone to 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalcone chloride and gluconate of chloride, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 in a place, such as a office or church, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic equipment shared as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by patients should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the double thigh or with a piece of paper on tossing or breathing, as well as immediately discarding any leg.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as using a mask may limit the volume and distance of movement of expiratory gothicles when speaking, breathing or tossing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "The use of masks can reduce the property of people to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without the proper hygiene of their hands." It has also been recommended that masks be used by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as the caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not to touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the public in general has begun to be encouraged.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks for the face made of bread. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks dissipated by healthy people in general, especially when getting in close contact with another person (to be 1 meter or less distance).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical masks is recommended by using public transport or by staying in isolated places.
The health authorities of Thailand are encouraging people to make facial bread masks at home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to go out in public without using a mask or cover the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to use facial masks when going out in public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded that everyone entering supermarkets use a mask for the face.
In Israel, all residents were asked to use masks for public face.
Taiwan, which has produced tens of millions of masks per day since the mid-March, has demanded that trains and inter-municipal buses use masks for the face from 1 April.
In Panama, the use of masks is mandatory for the face to go out in the street. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who cannot buy.
Skin masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions designed to accelerate the transmission of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone at home, limit their travel, avoid mixed areas, use uncontacted greetings and keep away from others.
At the moment, many governments are demanding or recommending social distance in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no COVID-19 transmission knowledge in a region) for 50 people and later for 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and committed immunological systems faced greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible in areas of Community epidemics. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify that the objective is to reduce the physical contact by maintaining social connections, whether virtual or distance.
The use of the term "social distance" led to the impression that social isolation was absolutely necessary instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published guidance on sexual health during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who has no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for appropriate self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-care for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive autoquarent instructions were issued to those found in high-risk groups.
It was advised that individuals who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with wide-scale transmission that have been doing 14 days of self-contamination since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling a tumor are the maintenance or suppression and reduction.
The maintenance is carried out in the preliminary stages of a turnout and aims to trace and isolate the infected, as well as to show other measures to control infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease for the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the spread speed and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as the population.
Continuation and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time, in combination.
Suspension requires more extreme measures in order to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproduction rate below 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to see how to try to reduce the tip of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmacovigilance interventions that may be administered in the south include personal preventive measures such as the hygiene of hands, the use of masks for face and autoquarent; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events leading to agglomeration; Community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as the cleaning of the contact areas; more drastic action, in order to contain the south, were taken in China when the gravity of the south was clear; entire cities, for example, were in quarantine and bans on travel were imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The South Korea, for example, presented the polling in mass and the forty localized. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they performed the auto-circuit and, for those who did not do so, were severely punished.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those of medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States showed that reduction (the reduction of contagion speed, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e. the revision of the growth of the epidemic) presented major challenges.
Ideally reducing policies can reduce the demand for health services in 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overloading health systems at the same time.
Suspension may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained while there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is a vaccine available, if it happens before. On the contrary, transmission is going to occur so soon the relaxation of the measures.
A long-term intervention to remove pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to the COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop drugs, which include the existing drug test.
The use of anti-fraud medicines that do not need medical prescription, sufficient liquid drinking and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous insertion of liquids or respiratory aid.
The use of steroids may worsen the condition.
Several previously approved components to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that certain "homes and traditional" medicines can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 as fundamental measures to fight back.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO Office in Europe issued guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services to allocate, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-binding procedures and separation and isolation of patients with positive test for COVID-19, as well as the increase in the capacity of intensive care by staff training and the increase in the number of beds and ventilators available.
There are different theories about the origin of the first case (the called zero patient).
The first case known in the new Coronavirus on December 1, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in the region increased gradually.
These cases were, in most cases, linked to the attacker market for the fruit of the Huanan Sea. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients were observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian, at the Hubei Provincial Hospital. The following day, the doctor informed Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Centre.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus of the SARS type".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were represented by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was represented by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The City Health Commission of Wuhan made a communication to the population on 31 December and informed the WHO.
Cases of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan's health authorities to generate an investigation at the beginning of January. During the first stages of the autumn, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre, in addition to a major point of railway connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Official data later show that 6,174 people had already developed the symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy, with the largest number of cases confirmed worldwide. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 were recovered.
About 200 countries and territories already had at least one case.
In view of the pandemic in Europe, many countries which are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The reactions of the countries included containment measures such as forty (also known as household restraint orders, domestic detention orders or lockdown) and collection campaigns. On 2 April, about 300 million people (about 90% of the population) are in some way confined to the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million are confined to South Africa and 1.3 billion are confined to India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide had already been found in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case, dated 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with unknown causes pneumonia on 26 December. His hospital reported to Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Centre on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests, on 27 December 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a coronavirus of the SARS type.
A communication to the population was issued by the City Health Commission of Wuhan on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, the Wuhan doctors were warned by the police to "slash rumors" on the east.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no " clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people" to contain the spread of the virus.
What was described as "the largest quarter of the history of humanity", a health chain was announced on 23 January to interrupt travel from walking or returning to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The New Chinese Year's celebrations, on 25 January, were canceled in several places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Together with recently built hospitals, China has converted 14 other Wuhan facilities into temporary hospitals, such as conventions and stadiums. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to contain the origin of COVID-19, including the release of health statements for travelers and the extension of the Festival of Primavera.
Universitys and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions took various measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures were taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions on travel were made in Hubei and outside of it.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (over half the population) were affected by some sort of restriction of exits. After the drought entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "import" of the virus in other countries.
Pequim, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On 23 March, continental China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in that case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese award, Li Keqiang, reported that the dissemination of domestic transmission cases had been essentially blocked and that the source had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown has been imposed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of China announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry into force of individuals with a view or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March without specific details on when this policy is closed.
Anyone who wants to enter China will need to make the request for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March, giving financial incentives to businesses. The State Council declared a day of struggle, starting with a three-minute silence in the whole country, on April 4 to 10 hours, matching the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their households online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new source of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu came from Wuhan were the source of the east.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1.261, or about 13% of them, reported symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February more than 2 thousand confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3.150 on 29 February.
All South Korea military bases were placed in a quarter after tests confirm that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The chronica of the air lines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized programme in terms of population screening for virus. The country also isolated the infected people and traced and put in quarantine those who entered contact with them.
The trial methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, testing of the virus by drive-three, with results available on the following day, in addition to the increase in test capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in the control of the east, although it has not placed entire cities in Kerentina. South Korean society was initially divided into the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed requests requesting Moon's impeachment under the claim of government management of the East, or raising its response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases below in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from the outside should be entered within a quarter of a week.

Iran has a total of five million Riais to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he did not have plans for the areas affected by the east, and only individuals would be placed in Quentin.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between the cities prior to the New Persian New Year continues.

The High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be relieved for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The tour was confirmed as having spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare emergency status.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was subsequently identified, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree to contain the east, including the quarter of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.

A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus up to that time could have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom’s response to the virus was first seen as one of the most brands of the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distance or mass-intensive measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticisms for the recognition of the lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential and social travel, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure facilities, such as pubs and academia, should be closed as quickly as possible, and it committed to pay 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the First Minister announced measures of more severe social distance, preventing aggregates with more than two people and restricting air travel and activities at least necessary.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO observed the contrast between the origin of SARS 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of ignoring data that made it difficult for the prevention and maintenance efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "supplyed regular updates to prevent the next Pan of festivals in the new moon year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, following the confirmation of the transmission between people outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the rise as an International Public Health Emergency (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the Swedish influenza pandemic in 2009.
The Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhannom, said that the PHIC was invoked due to the "risk of global dispersion, especially in low and medium-sized countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tetros stated that "there is no reason for the measures that have taken unnecessary intervention in international and trade travel" and that "OMS does not recommend limiting trade and displacement."
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and medium-income countries, urging the urgent assistance of these countries that "have no systems in force to detect those who are infected with the virus, and even if it is emerging".
Tetros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest eye" and asked the international community "invist now or have to pay later". On 11 February, WHO at a press conference set COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tetros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide the “power of the entire United Nations system as a response”.
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing for the coordination of all United Nations response, which the WHO will say will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and development implications of the source".
On 14 February, a Joint WHO mission team with China was enabled to provide international and WHO experts on land in China with assistance in home management and to assess "the severity and transmission of disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and to undertake field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panorama". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of Coronavirus", saying that, although it was very early to declare a pandemic, countries should also establish "a phase of preparation".
In response to a development source in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the overall risk assessment of Coronavirus would be high for "very high", which is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency programme, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Agreement.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be ready," stressing that correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan still stated that current data did not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every person on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the origin of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned about alarming levels of dispersion and severity, and alarming levels of inaction". WHO faced many criticisms by which it was seen as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late public health declaration and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a request to the Director General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 thousand people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights specialists emphasized the respect for individual rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to intervene to save life and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts pointed out that each individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, elderly people, people with mental problems, unemployed, those living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups who need government assistance.
Intergovernmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as points of view and advice.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the United Kingdom Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsnaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were dismissed on the basis of their approach to the efforts related to the Quentin in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political establishment to the rise in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the origin of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the origin of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring theories of the conspiracy on the original COVID-19 of the USA or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump referred to Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "suppressed a virus that now became a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way to reverse the failure in administration to control the disease".
Daily Beach has been achieved by the government of the United States in a detailed communication strategy with emerging sources in the National Security Council, with a strategy called "that's all to see with China.
We were advised to try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Canaries such as Politicians, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for a global influence.
The Head of Foreign Policy of the European Union, Joseph Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including an influence fight through a trendy and 'general policies' point of view.
Borrell also said that "China is actively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also asked the United States to suspend its sanctions in Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while supposedly sending aid to those countries.
Jack Ma's 100 thousand masks for Cuba were blocked by United States sanctions on April 3.
The authorities of the United States were also accused of diverting the aid to other nations for their own country.
It hears disputes relating to masks related to other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of ventilators for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the lack of solidarity of the European Union with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfectants, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or little" for Italy.
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic offensive".
The president of the region of Lombardy, Attlio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Mayo, made the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical supplies to the United States.
The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials were in a good phase, they would also act mutually if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be maintained on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticised the 2002 Defeder 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts the lives at risk not only from the US troops and several European countries participating but from the people of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as 15 political figures in exercise or ex-political.
The President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders, asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is having difficulties in combating hunger due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The source led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, childcare, paid family license, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts predict that this might negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-electing himself as president in the 2020 elections. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to pandemics.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambitious and passive efforts, after Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in a quarter of two weeks in places designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed requests by requesting Moon's intervention in relation to what they called inappropriate management of the east, or by praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to adopt emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of allowing Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament as well as the elections and punish those deemed to have spread false news about the virus and the crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of loss of supplies, resulting from increased use of equipment in a global way to combat noise, purchases motivated by panic, and interruption of operations in factories and logistics.
Food and Administration of the United States issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions of the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the event of purchases motivated by the panic that led to the useless wastes of essential products such as food, hygiene paper, mixed water, including lack of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment fell 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in supplying medical items for four to six months.
This has also caused a lack of personal protection equipment from the world, with the WHO's warning that this would put the health of workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently released by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food, both areas were covered by a deep shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have succeeded, avoiding the lack of adequate food provided for in Europe, as well as in North America.
The north of Italy with its significant agricultural production did not notice a significant decrease, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty meals were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A global economic injury was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to end the spread of the virus, and sales in the neighborhood fell by 20.5%.
As China Continental is a large economy and manufacturing centre, the viral source has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist intelligence unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the turnout of SARS 2002-2004.
An estimate of a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis showed an impact of $300 billion on the world supply chain that could last for up to two years.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporters (OPEC) assumed that it "confused" after a decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global action markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside of Continental China.
On 27 February, due to increasing concerns about the origin of Coronavirus, several United States pool indexes including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the middle of the Dow Jones industry showed their most expressive losses since 2008, with the fall of Dow in 1,191 points, the biggest one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indexes ended the week with a lower 10%.
On 28 February, Skopje Ratings GmbH stated the classification of sovereign credit in China, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions again fell on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the largest fell on 16 March.
Many consider a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central states and banks.
Central banks are responding faster than they have responded to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closing public places, including tourist points, and recommending governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many air lines canceled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Kantas, while British Regional Airline Flybe entered into collapse.
The impact on the cruise sector was never seen.
Several train stations and balsa doors were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the wound of the New Chinese Year.
Several events involving large crowds were canceled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, with private companies also closing their hotels and tourist attractions such as the Disneylândia in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Year's events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Banned City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the wound of the New Year to 10 February, instructing most of the jobs not to be reopened until this date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The summer sector was affected globally, with reductions in the hours of the stores or temporary closures.
Visits to sellers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
The salesmen from North America and the Middle East observed a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a decrease of 33-43% in pedestal traffic to commercial centres in March compared to February.
The world's shopping centres have imposed additional measures, such as a greater cleanup, the installation of thermal scanners to check the buyers' temperature, and the cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America from what would happen in situations without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million migrant rural workers in China were left at home in provinces of the interior or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
Coronavirus's turn could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The restriction in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid daily) unemployed. A research by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of the Canadian families had gone through some type of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the restriction in mid-March 2020.
During the second fifteenth of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Almost half a million companies in Germany placed their employees under short-term work programmes under the government-known Kurzabeit.
The work programme with German time reduced was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performance arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of the organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture organizations tried to keep their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, to maintain the safety of their staff and the public and to help artists when possible.
In March 2020, the world and at various levels, museums, libraries, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or added.
In response, there were intense efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-speed impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, large sports events, and other social events, such as music and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of the Holy Week in Rome, which would occur during the last week of the period of the Christian Quarter, had been canceled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home to participate in the Mass on Sundays; some churches provided the services of the church via radio, streaming to live online or by television while others offer cults style drive-in.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of St. Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, churches, churches, churches and shrines.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of prayers on Friday in areas affected by the East and Saints, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreigners, as well as its residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the main events were cancelled or added, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Campsite League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The tour interfered in plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "reorganised for a date after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021".
This led many players to play online, with several online games sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many big theaters like Broadway also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live broadcasts or creating "festivals" online for artists to present, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the Internet on the coronavirus are spread, as many are looking for humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19, an increase in preconception, xenophobia and racism has been observed for people of Chinese or Asian descent, and against people of the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, eastern Asia, North America, and in the Pacific region.
February's results (when most of the cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people meriting the virus or being receiving a just punishment for what they have caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both on-line and off-line, and is directed to those in areas covered by the virus.
After the rise in new focus countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed requests by pressureing Chinese entry into their countries to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was on Twitter's Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported growing levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump was critical of the reference to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Manifests in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the northeastern India, who are bordering China, and students in the big cities of India have reportedly suffered persecution related to the origin of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why God turned against them."
The comments were later condemned by China's consultant in Calcutta, who called him "inquired". In China, xenophobic and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were invaded by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign lixo" and "descarte".
Many newspapers with payment access removed them from some or all coverings on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have provided scientific articles related to open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions with preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analysis for the respiratory disease of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS virus - CoV-2 associated include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by the RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests revealed how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very braided to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of mortality of the disease and the level of immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variable may still substantially affect the mortality rates of recorded cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with reverse-time cross-section (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by different methods, including nasopharyngitis or saliva sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours or in 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out with the fatigue of the Faringe is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be withdrawn from the background of respiratory pathways by catheter of suction or explosive (secretary) material may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with reverse-time transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It seeks by the gene "E" shared by all coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for emergency use of the National Medical Products Administration of China for SARS-CoV-2-based detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits generated inconclusive tests as a result of failure, and an obstacle to CDC testing in Atlanta; this resulted in a mean of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
The tests used by two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and from then only local and state laboratories were allowed to initiate the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. The commercial laboratories started the tests at the beginning of March 2020.
From 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for the COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also became the tests for COVID-19 nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; the collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Watch Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic stated that it had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4.128 tests in a period of 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in the Abbott system m2000; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Hholic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepidhe also received an FDA US for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the technology to amplify isothermic nuclear acid instead of PCR.
As it does not require a range of alternative temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibodies and the connection in particular to the nucleop acid protein (Protein N) of the new Coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a quick flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "torax radiographs have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while TC findings, computerized tomography, may be present even before symptoms arise".
The typical features in TC include bilateral multilobular opacities in fossil glass with a lateral, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural domination, mosaic flooring and consolidation evolve in accordance with progressive disease.
A study comparing PCR to TC in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that the TC is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, with many of its image aspects matching other pneumonies and pathological processes.
From March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first line test for diagnosis of COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These may be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days or later after the emergence of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. The tests may be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or through remote laboratory tests (POCT).
The automated high productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and are now able to distribute their anti-corporate tests.
From 7 April 2020 only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is of several hundred samples in time and therefore much faster than the conventional PCR tests of viral RNA.
Antibodys are usually detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the kits of acquired antibodies were suitable enough to be used.
Hong Kong organized a system in which suspect patients may be at home, "the emergency department will provide a sample tube for the patient", they must operate salt in the tube, send it back and get a result soon afterwards. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection of a patient if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any of them is used. In the case of suspects, a health professional collects samples by taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-Three centres have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and wideest tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Statutory Doctors stated on 2 March that it had a capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in ambulatory care, while 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are the responsibility of health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity for 160 thousand tests per week.
Since 19 March, driving-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany remains unknown, as only the positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of 483.295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) were positive for the SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, gathering samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised 2000 m2 laboratory for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: fire, or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and for 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of dealing with the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had not been on-line access.
The Wuhan laboratory was immediately followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Pequim, and Changai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily performance was 50 thousand tests per day. Open-code multi-plex models released by Origami Assays were launched as testing capacity up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without the need for robotic manuals for liquids.
In March, lack of or insufficient response became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study samples preparation protocols that involve the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes for additional tests. On 31 March, it was revealed that the United Arab Emirates are now conducting more testing by residents in their population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be the way to increase the testing level and reach the majority of the population.
This was given by a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a laboratory for processing in population scale of Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to drive tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first world of this scale to operate outside China.
Different test methods for different components of the genetic profile of coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German method for the production of kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January, there was delay in the tests available for the US and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the spring, and in addition these countries together with Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to satisfy the demand and recommendations made by health professionals.
In contrast, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The test capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated for many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of test programmes as the best way to delay the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the provision of cotonettes and chemical reactions was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with precision in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were "false"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the individual tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the missing results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure in the collection of samples or in the incorrect use of kits.
The Spanish minister said he would cancel the kits that generated wrong results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits bought by the Czech Republic from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million kits from China considered unnecessary.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be disbanded in Denmark. At the Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey's test kits bought from China had a "high error rate" and would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 it announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by a quarter of those who tested positive and monitored those with whom the positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had been contacted, had positive results.
The researchers who work in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two test stages of the whole population of approximately 3,400 people, with a range of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the move to the restricted community, this completely eliminated new infections.
With the aggressive monitoring of the contact, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, the pandemic of the Coronavirus in 2020 in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales facilities.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to strongly advise the residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened within the plan after holidays on 23 March.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed more tests, with regard to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples for one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % of tests" column is influenced by country testing policy.
A country that only has hospitalised people will have more % of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they are present or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or washing hands), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands with the purpose of removing sweat, fat, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by gold-feal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucosa).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap are important include: before and after the defection, after cleaning the baby’s bubble or replace it with fredes, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, franc or cross fish.
If water and sand are not available, hands can be cured with pigs. The World Health Organization recommends that hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After you change your shoes or clean up a child you've used the bathroom.
After drying the nose, tossing or breathing.
After touching animals, breeds or animals.
The clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main objective of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteries, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who manage food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in children born at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for washing hands can cause small improvements in children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simple introduction of behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude may reduce the mortality rate of these diseases in almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing may reduce diarrhoea episodes around a third, which is comparable to providing clean water for missing areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behaviour in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The pneumonia, the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diaries and combined pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children each year.
According to UNICEF, transforming your hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom in an arrhythmias can save lives more than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing the deaths by diarrhoea almost half and deaths of respiratory infections in a room.
Hand washing is generally associated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against the impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that the frequent washing of hands can cause skin injuries due to skin resuscitation.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of demeaning and irritation in the skin known as hand eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among workers in the health system.
The frequent washing of hands is also perceived as one of the symptoms of complex obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (mixture, defecation), after cleaning a child’s pump (dry bottle), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling meat, fish or crust.
Other situations where the correct technique for washing hands must be used in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include prior and after treatment of a cut or wound; after breathing, tossing or drying the nose; after touching animals or dealing with animals; and after taking a shower.
In many countries, there is a reduced washing rate of hands with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of the families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was close to the average by 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate of 23 percent. There are a number of methods for behavioral changes that are currently in order to increase the acceptance of hand washing with soap in critical periods. The collective washing of hands for children in schools in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to induce washing hands in children's habits.
The "Essensian Health Services Programme" implemented by the Philippines Education Department is an example of a broad-scale action to promote children's health and education.
The disposal twice a year, complemented with washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with flowers, is at the centre of this national programme.
He was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is strengthened by adding soaps and water-detergents.
The main action of soaps and solvents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
The water itself is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleanness, however, is facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The sand in the bar, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria of previous uses.
A reduced number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated sand concluded that the transmission is unlikely as bacteria are infected with the foam.
The CDC repeats "fixed sabonate with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial saboteurs were widely disseminated to the public conscious in terms of health.
Up to now, there are no indications that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotics resistant to nature.
However, antibiotics contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which have an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, although antibiotics resistant strains are not selected by antibiotics, they may not be as effective as they are exposed.
In addition to the surface agents and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, assorbic acid, melecon acid) as a pH regulator, benzoic active acid antimicrobial and other hydraters for skin (aloe vera, vitamins, mangol, vegetal extracts). An extensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are so effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps returned to the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria increase faster in body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove natural oleosity that remains subjective and bacteria.
In contrast to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce the microbial load in the hands.
A hand hygienic or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the twenty-first century, non-alcohol-based hygiene agents (also known as the product for the hygiene of hands based on alcohol, the product for the hygiene of antiseptic hands, or the hygiene of hands) began to gain popularity.
The majority is made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thicking agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), gel, or an inducer, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol absorption.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygienes containing a minimum of 60 to 95% of alcohol kill germs effectively.
Alcohol-based hygiene kills bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, renovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienes containing 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (a decrease of 3.5 logirats, similar to 35 decibels) of the bacteria in their hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.990% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logirats) of the bacteria in their hands 1 minute after their application. Hand hygiene is more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hygienics are almost completely ineffective against the virus of the type norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contaminated gastroenteritis. Antisceptics for hands or alcohol-based hygienics can be used to wash or cover both hands.
The bones and palms of your hands, between your fingers and your limbs, are frozen for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foams or gel is dry.
The finger points should also be well washed, with the two palm branches frozen. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with hands hygiene, especially when hands are visualally soft.
The growing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminator action against microorganisms; however, they must not replace the proper washing of hands unless they know and water are available.
The frequent use of hand hygiene based on alcohol may cause skin resuscitation, unless emulsions and/or skin hydrates are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol absorption may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand hygiene based on alcohol containing emoliants caused substantially less irritability and resuscitation in the skin than sabones or antimicrobial agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or the additives present in the manual-based hands rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause dermatitis of irritative contact became an attraction compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous basic agents do not wash the hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygieneists are not as effective as water and sand to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol hand hygiene is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically remained much closer to alcohol and to alcohol-based hygiene.
More recently, formulations using benzalcone chloride revealed continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after administration, unlike alcohol, which revealed its reduced efficacy after repeated use, probably due to increasing skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low income communities are unable to cost a soap and instead use salt or soil.
Blue or soil may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or the ashes are contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, the smoke is also a disinfectant, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends blue and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for washing hands recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or hot running water.
It is recommended that current water as fixed baths may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem relevant.
Wash your hands, fracturing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your knees.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when used soap instead of pure water.
Swallow for at least 20 seconds.
The act of spraying generates atrito, which helps to remove the skin's germs, and for a greater time it removes more germs.
Have a good touch with current water.
Washing on a sheet may resustain your hands.
Eat with a dry towel or let go of free air.
Hand milled or wet hands are more easily retraced. The most commonly forgotten areas are pulsating, push, the areas between the fingers and under one.
Artificial and smelting insects can be found in microorganisms.
It is often recommended that hydrating fraction be maintained to maintain the hydrated hands; dry skin may cause skin lesions which may increase the risk of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate washing of hands where there is no current water and/or sand, for example, to see water from a gallon or which has suitable sources and/or to use five if needed in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improved torrents" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tower is a simple technology that uses a rope suspended by a rope, and a foot- actiond avalanche to waste a small amount of water in the hands and a sandbar.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hands hygiene process, but there is a discussion on the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that toilet paper is more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the Toalha paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by the Toalha paper, hand dryers with hot air and the latest hand dryers with air jackets.
After washing and drying hands with hot air, the total number of bacteria was considered to be 194% higher in the area of the palm near the teeth and 254% in the rest of the palm.
The drying with dryers with air jackets resulted in an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, by 42% in the area of palm trees near the teeth and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, to 76% in the area of palm trees near the teeth and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential of cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air-conditioner, which projects air out of the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to eject microorganisms from the hands and unit, potentially harming other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of hand dryer with hot air disperses microorganisms up to 0.25 meters of the dryer.
Toalha papers did not present a significant dispersion of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Umwelt, different methods for drying hands were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with toilet paper.
Washing hands with washed hands hygiene lenses for hands is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Hand hygiene based on alcohol must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The clinical washing of hands became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remember the hospital's team to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that the rates of infection decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of hands is for at least 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to dry and cool all parts of the hands.
The hands should be washed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there are any wastes below them, a drawer can be used to remove them.
As the brothers can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the tower (and open the door, if necessary).
This prevents the rectification of hands by these surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper washing of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the incidence of infections in the blood stream related to catheter in 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a booklet demonstrating the standard of washing and washing of hands in the health sector.
The guide project for the hygiene of the hands of the organization can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate the hygiene of hands, if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for washing hands:
after exposure to body/sanguine fluids
before an ascetic task, and
After patient care, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to sabonite (sabonetes "medicine" or "antimicrobials") provides an exterminatory action to a washing agent.
Such extreme action may be desirable before performing a surgery or in situations in which antibiotics resistant organisms are dominant. To "clean" the hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tower that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, some antiseptics of chloride or iodine, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilised cover for cleaning and other sterilised instruments for cleaning under one’s hands.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and fronts up to the knees, usually from 2-6 minutes.
A very long period of cleaning (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, water in the antebrates should not flow to the hands.
After washing the hands, the hands are washed with a sterile towel and the surgical bag is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
In order to control staphilococic infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of the washing of hands in the first 20%, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the purity frequency exceeded 35%.
The washing with common soap is more than tripled by the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to foods compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing the hygiene of hands with an alcohol-based solution with washing hands with an antibacterial soap for an average period of 30 seconds for each revealed that the hand hygiene on the alcohol base reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than manual hygiene to reduce influenza A, H1N1, and Clostridium difficult spas in the hands. The interventions to increase the hygiene of hands in hospital environments may involve awareness of the team on washing hands, increasing the availability of manual hygiene on the basis of alcohol and verbal warnings and written to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more effective in different health institutions.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for better health and nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water sources, soap or resources for washing hands in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the conquest of universal practice of washing hands.
For example, in most rural Africa the tournaments for washing hands near any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low wash rates of hands can rather be the result of confused habits and not of the absence of soap and water.
The incentive and protection of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause a long-term change in behavior of the population.
In order for this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low and middle countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's three-star approach that encourages schools to give simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the three maximum stars.
The construction of hand washing stations may be part of the promotional campaigns to wash hands with a view to reducing diseases and infant mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change in habits. As a result of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF announced the adoption of an emio to wash hands.
Few studies considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to classification in DALY.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who have just given birth to light or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two pre-historics of the hygiene of the hands: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food sources and infections associated with health care led the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused increased awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect from such infectious diseases.
For example, "hand washing techniques" cardboards were painted near the front to wash hands in public bathrooms and in bathrooms of office and airport buildings in Germany.
The expression "handling" means declaring the repugnance in taking responsibility or being aware of something.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate stretched the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands thoroughly in an attempt to clean up an imaginary weakness, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been verified that people, after remembering or presenting anti-thetic acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and tend to give more importance to washing equipment.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less inclined to perform other "cleanness"-compensatory acts, such as volunteer.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not knowing, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of the hands characteristic in many religions, including Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netitat Yadayim in Judaism, the washing of hands in Christianity, and the abolition in Islam. Religions also indicate hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow washing of hands before and after meals.
Risk controls at the workplace for COVID-19
Risk controls in the work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies in the work for risk controls for the prevention of COVID 2019 disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the place of work and on the basis of the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), less exposure risk functions have minimal employment contact with the public and other working colleagues, for which basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure risk functions include those that require frequent or direct contact with persons who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of contamination by COVID-19 but may be infected due to current Community transmission or by travelling abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public as in schools, high population density working environments, and large volumes on the market.
The risk controls for this group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and the availability of individual protection equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that the workers of the health and necrotrite system that are exposed to people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers carry out procedures in people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of aerosol generation and collect or manage species of these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have various effects at work.
Workers may be absent from work because they are sick, because they have to take care of other people or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
The trade standards may vary, both in terms of which products are in demand as well as the means of purchasing these products (such as buying out of picko time or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items of areas seriously affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan of action and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from home and community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and the contingent plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among officials, protecting those who are at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing the adverse effects on other entities on supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a widely used health and safety structure of the work to group the safety controls effectively.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve the insulation of workers' work-related hazard officers, and they can be the most economic implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or working procedures required by the worker's or employer's action.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposure.
All types of EPI should be selected on the basis of the risk to the worker, adjusted appropriately according to the requirements (e.g. respiratorys, for example), used appropriately and continuously, regularly inspected, stored and replaced, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), low exposure risk work has minimal employment contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic measures for prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and methiculous washing of hands, incentives for workers to stay at home if they are patients and the use of the respiratory label, including tapping the breath and toss, preparation of solvents for joints and the joint waste, preparing for work or for scalding rotations, if necessary, the removal of the use of other workers' tools and equipment and the maintenance of a clean and disinfection routine.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees present symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or other symptoms, and also recommends that health-care policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a family member, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to the OSHA, works with average exposure risk include those who require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to current Community transmission at the company's premises, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact the public in general as in schools, high population density working working environments, and some high-class high volume of sales. Engineering controls for this group and higher risk groups include the installation of high efficiency air filter filters, the increase of ventilation, the installation of high air filter high efficiency, the installation of ventilation, the installation of physical barrier windows, as well as the installation of trans-air filter windows, such as hygic light light light light light lamps, and the installation of a driver driver window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and higher risk groups include administrative controls for this group and risk groups of risk groups include incentivess for workers to be at home, replacement of meetings in replacement of meeting meetings by virtual communication virtual communication, replacement engineering control of engineering for this group and higher risk groups. engineering

Workers in this risk group rarely need breathers.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect the workers and other passengers include the isolation of the patient from the other people by a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a member of the crew to serve the patient and offer her a facial mask, or ask the patient to cover his mouth and nose with ties to his tossing or breathing.
The crew should use disposal medical needles to use a patient's passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, possibly, additional individual protection equipment if the patient presents fever, persistent toxin or difficulty breathing.
Luvas and other waste items should be disposed of in a bag for biological risk residues, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazardous controls include the addition of travel by the sick passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone has any fever or other symptoms during the trip.
The ideal is that medical follow-up takes place in the private person's cabin. For schools and child care centres, CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the front, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is a minimum Community transmission to moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling trips in field, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a launchnet, increasing the space between meals, times of arrival and more rigid departure, limiting non-essential visitors and using a separate health care space for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, prolonged school spending may be considered. For the law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered under the CDC.
It is recommended that the police who contact individuals suspected of COVID-19 or the confirmed disease prescribe the same guidelines as emergency medicine techniques, including the use of appropriate individual protection equipment.
If the direct contact occurs during the opening, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common spray or bread of domestic cleaning and follow the standard operating procedures for the maintenance and provision of the IP used and for the contents and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health and neucroteria workers as being in high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure functions include drug delivery workers, medical assistance, laboratories and medical transport, which are exposed to patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers carry out aerosol generation procedures in patients with or suspected COVID-19 confirmed, or collect or manipulate species of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubate, induction procedures to the tox, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests or invasive collection of species.
High exposure necrotrites include workers involved with the preparation of bodies with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolate rooms for patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected disease, including when aerosol generator procedures are carried out.
Specialised ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some scenarios of necroterios and in the area of health.
Species should be managed with caution of level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated from two different waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspect case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends breathing for professionals working at a 6-foot distance of patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmation or suspected infection, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respiratorys with N95 particle filtering approved by NIOSH or high-quality respiratoryers should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection programme that includes adjustment, training and medical examination tests.
Other types of breathers can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of macaws, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-spiratory body fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for the trial staff at the entrance point.
For professionals who collect respiratory species, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, eye protection or facial protection, surgical avental and luvas.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory tracter.
Since the overall supply of EPIs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for EPIs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients in a coma with a patient with COVID-19 using only the EPI necessary for the specific task, using the same breather without removing it as treatment of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitors and coordinates the EPI supply chain and disables the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

ASSUNT: [Covid-19] Meeting the problems and preparing for the future
Date/Time: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LIST: CC0: No rights reserved
People are in unusual circumstances this month.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is something that makes our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have in relation to the other.
Its challenges do not exist before, but we know that our best actions are accompanied by global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
Competitiveness and concern that we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am very grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me his recognition for our work.
That person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and what is a powerful symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to all.
The work of you makes it possible, because you keep the active jobs, pay our colleagues and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but the way we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments in the way we work together, starting next week.
You adjusted to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and hours for the next days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think to be an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable in this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long term.
If you need to stay away for a while, there's no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contractors:
our daily work expectations will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until the counter is ready.
We're not declaring a wounded. If you can work at the normal time, it can be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy maintenance or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule wouldn't have to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
You do not need to be certified or paid. Just report your manager helping your team to review the calendar and schedules to ensure that the working areas are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, report to the Bryan of the training and certification sector so that its sector can help you and ensure that your situation gets the proper attention of the management).
The person who works for an hour will receive the full payment.
We have already said that before, and we are committed to honouring our commitment to our employees and employees working time.
All will receive their salaries on the basis of their normal work schedule under normal circumstances.
Salaries depend on whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we fully support you.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just asked you to communicate with your manager, so we know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to perform.
The Site Trust Engineering Teams, RH, Trust and Security and Funding (including others) carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most important projects.
Dissembling now won't harm us in the future.
We do not intend to "work twice to recover the time lost" after the pandemic has ended.
It will not be expected that you work extra hours to meet the deadlines that are now ineffective.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new targets and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the Annual Planning?
In order to adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours per day, we intend to adjust the chronological for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our plan 2019-2020, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritise the essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced day in the coming weeks.
The extension of the Chronogram reduces widely the current planning work load and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Directorate next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Planning Team for its leadership in this process.
Status, exhibition and office cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues at work in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, we are careful to use an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance bag and all the lifters that give access to our walk.
The award is using its own duty protocol using products that are safe for their participants.
We are relieved of the fact that the office will be duly prepared for our decision to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol to the COVID-19 we know and with all Washington staff.
Last week, our office in Washington changed to a completely remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the location of a office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to occur, but they can suffer a delay.
Some of our colleagues are working very hard for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer some advice:
They limit the duration of the meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If sessions with greater duration are required, they will be considered to be divided in several days.
They define the meeting, have a programming and send material before reading.
Use videos as standard, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real time collaboration and connection.
They have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable hearing backgrounds.
They use their emergency aid to buy tears.
Share of channel #remoties to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operation team is looking for ergonomic guidelines in the context of the webinar to assist in increasing remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all the community's beneficiaries to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as publishing maratons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warn them that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could not prevent the completion of their agreed subsidy activities, and that no one would be penalized by extending or modifying their targets.
In the coming week, we will continue with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be sad with paralysis, but also with clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up to date on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with the officials.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting each other.
We're in this together and we're gonna help with what we need.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 in the company's wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any question about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need to help, do not leave it to notify it and work with the communication resource team.
We are here to help provide support and cooperation as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, send an e-mail to Bryan Judahn, Director of Global Operations of RH.
None of these changes should be seen as leaving our work and obligations.
However, they are a recognition that our work and obligations will likely need to be adapted in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps that we believe to be necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting when the time comes.
Meanwhile, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably, the following months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of themselves and their family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resource team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the lead team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme of type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cellular membranes) of the cells of lungs, arteries, heart, rhythm, and intestines.
The ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and by raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also works as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme of type 2 is a metalloenzyme that contains zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an M2 N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal transporter domain of amino acids and cholesterol in the renal system.
The ECA2 is a membrane protein of type 1 single passage, with its enzymely active domain exposed to the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleared from the domain of the transmembrane by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting solvent protein is released in the blood current and finally excreted in the urine.
The ECA2 is present in many organs: the ECA2 is attached to the cell membrane of the main pulmonary cells of type II, intestinal entropys, arterial endothelial cells and venous vascular muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of the ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stranded body, hypothalamus, and encephalic throne.
The main function of the ECA2 is to act as a barrier to the ECA.
The ECA detects angiotensin hormone type I in type II angiotensin causing vasoconstruction.
The ECA2, for its part, binds to phenylalanine of amino acid carbonate from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Phe) and hydrolysis of vasodilate angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also includes several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradycin, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the transport by the membrane of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 works as the main entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the link of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein spike to the ECA2 enzyme domain in the cell surface results in endocitosis and transfer of the virus and enzyme in endosomals located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serina-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to raise the possibility that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ECA inhibitor standard and therapy with ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors who presented a high risk of contracting pneumonia, in particular those with AVC and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with the reduction of mortality related to pneumonia, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
It is believed that ECA2 recombinant human (rhACE2) is a new treatment for acute pulmonary lesion, and it seemed to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with a acute respiratory disease syndrome induced by lipopoliscaride.
The mean-life of rhACE2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes after the temporary evolution of the effects (period) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the inhibitors of the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in patients in whom angiotensin II is high in circulation. RhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory arrhythmias.
Applications on COVID-19 are mobile software applications to assist in monitoring in response to coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with infected individuals.
A number of applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications were developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographical location of the users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other cells.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced jointly that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with joy, implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they were in contact with a COVID-19 carrier person.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open code and will be issued to the government. The North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application was pending approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in advanced development stage, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is planned for Ireland and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, listed a series of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including positive errors and the lack of effectiveness if the application's acceptance is limited to a small proportion of the population.
In response to concerns about the dissemination of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for the types of organisations that can add coronavirus-related applications to its App Store, restricting them only to "official" organisations or otherwise respected.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially on whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be demanded when the threat has passed.
The International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a communication requesting limits for this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extension of monitoring and monitoring should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purpose of COVID-19;
the safety and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid distorting discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be protection against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including public health specialists and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters without Frontiers (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checkslists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of its operating system when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data have considerable privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to execute contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system collected trace information from various sources, including trace data from mobile devices and transaction data with card, combining them to generate warnings via text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also become publicly available information on location, which is allowed due to changes in the privacy laws of the information after the departure of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a series of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy system and the centralised one.
By 6 April 2020 the details were not yet disclosed.
The tracking of contact while preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography repeating, at least, 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include the Decentralised Privacy-Conserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identityable personal data never depart from the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group on MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques during collection and use of location data or cross-border routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Applications play sujo: maintaining personal privacy in an epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of the MPC Enigma Enigma, a commitment that develops privacy technologies and originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and responsible users without compromising their privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that joined around what was essentially the same approach and largely with overposition of protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the overall adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the Government's official application, became an open code.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that controlled Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for the tracking of contacts, which claimed to preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy conservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
developing tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications by maintaining privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to deal with persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by operating systems updates, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription (also known as a drug proposal, reperfilation, re-substantiation or therapeutic substitution) is the proposal of an approved drug for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research guidelines include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug proteins, each with multiple connection points.
Analysis of these link points provides the rational project of effective antiviral drug development against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the protease similar to papain, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribavirin.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidates who then improved and analyzed their structural similarities with the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their pre-clinical study to be recommended for a clinical design.
Chloroquina is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the related chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical trial Solidarity.
The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests with chlorquin and hydroxychloroquine of New York State began on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloric acid sulphate and chlorine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised by the EU only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalised patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "use, dose or duration of hydrochloric acid for prevention or treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2" is not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when "no other option".
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Great studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydrochloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half was treated with favipyravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacyetic Agency reminded the population that the evidence available to base the medicine is weak and preliminary.
On April 2nd, Germany announced that it would buy Japan's medicine to stow it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the administration of Trump on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Your use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to pregnancy.
A lopinavir/ritonavir study (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV through association with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compost linked to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to repair drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
The remDesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for the disease of Ebola virus and infections by Marburg’s virus. The Gilead Sciences discovered that remDesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against fil, pneumium, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations, which may cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-tests suggest that remDesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and another for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for patients hospitalised and severely ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (China and Canada), while the other does not have control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclesonida) from Teijin, which is an asthma-induced corticosteroid. The goal is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is ongoing with 200 patients, being recruited among the serious cases hospitalised in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
At the moment, researchers from the Institute of the heart in Canada are investigating the role of cochicin in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, which did not require hospitalization.
They were not included in pregnant women's tests, which are breast-feeding or do not use effective anti-choice methods.
Several anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on the use.
A multicentre study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses. The study was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in order to give new purpose to the approved and developed antiviral drugs for the treatment of previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as being capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (receptor anti-IL-6): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the disease of the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with completed clinical tests, there are several attempts in progress to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, disease- causing virus, available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major spread of the spring occurred in 2020, leading to significant investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the needs for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and in development during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the major platforms that have advanced for phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (frozen phase I and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector ( Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are at the initial stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being planned).
A phase I-II test conducts the safety and preliminary immunogenicity test. It is typically randomized, controlled by placebo and multicentre, at the same time as determines the most accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease while monitoring adverse effects at the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccine (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in human beings (continued in pre-clinical study).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular gram, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccines Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announced the start of work in a vaccine, with the aim of testing in human beings in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases in China, on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the beginning of their work for the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-designing an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner in Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine with similar technology as used for the treatment of vaccination against neoantigens.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in people "in the next 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the U.S. Army Research and Medical Development Command in Fort Derrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in the western region of Maryland, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, the Emergent Biosolutions announced that they had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the pre-clinical test and Phase I clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, would take at least one year and two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Health Research Institutes.
The vaccine candidate is being investigated in the laboratory, with the human test planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, offered CureVac "great amounts of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in pre-clinical testing, with expected clinical tests to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results from pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could come from human tests in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Preparation for Epidemia (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a vaccine research group for COVID-19 involving the Institute Pastor, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pitttsburgh, bringing the total ECPI investment in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists started testing in animals of six different candidates from the vaccine.
The researchers from the Imperial College in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an automatic RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receipt of Chinese sequencing.
By the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on anti-drug drugs against COVID-19, including several candidates for vaccine in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the initiatives of the University of Saskatchewan.
Almost during the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national vaccine bank of several new vaccines that could be used if other sources of Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA delivered vaccines from SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 that triggered powerful responses from specific antibodies to antibodies [in rat] that were evidence that they started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a vaccine based on DNA as possible a nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be planned to replication into a human bacteria to produce infensive particles similar to virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, combined with the computer in the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologists, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease she is suffering.
A randomized post-test in Australia is seeking to register 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that developing vaccines are not safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of specific animals for COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other non-human laboratory and primates, indicate a need for biosafety measures to manage live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in samples of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no vaccine tested against MERS.
When MERS became dominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against the infection of MERS-CoV.
Since March 2020, there has been a vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) that concluded phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are vaccinated by viruses, two with adheviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vetted by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a theory of conspiracy saying that the virus behind the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents quoted by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other branches of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of olfat and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the start of symptoms is approximately 5 days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some evolve to a viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153 thousand deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been treated. The virus is spread among the people mainly during direct contact, usually through gothics produced by the touch, breath or speech.
Although these gothicles are produced when exposed, they usually fall in the ground or remain in surfaces rather than remain infective in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive in surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the start of symptoms, although dispersion may be possible before the symptoms appear and at subsequent stages of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by reaction in the chain of the reverse transcrisis in real-time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for those responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries throughout the six regions of the WHO.
Virus infections may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms similar to influenza, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
The symptoms of emergency include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty in keeping awake, face or blue lips.
Less common, symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as breathing, snoring nose or throat pain may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only open in the chest and palpitations.
In some, disease can develop for pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for the COVID-19 is normally six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infections will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatics in transmission is not yet fully known; however, a preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of disease.
The proportion of people not infected with symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The scar and salva can load large viral loads.
Speaking high free is more Gothic than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that tossing without covering the mouth can make the gothics reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioerosol transmission can be possible and air collectors positioned outside the rooms of people contain positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubate and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP), may generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolated and thus transmitted by the air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the stages, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptoms. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although it is not fully clear how easily the disease is spread, normally one or two people are infected.
In particular, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in paper, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
That, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Sabón and detergent are also effective if they are properly used. Sabán products degradate the lipid protective envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalcone chloride and chlorexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were associated with a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside of the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by the COVID-19 because the virus causes host cells through angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart disease was observed in 12% of the infected people who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The cardiovascular symptoms rate is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the evolution of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with the ECE2 receptors in the heart.
The ECE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in the heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in patients in ITI with COVID-19 infections and may be related to hormonal prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 have been shown to an alveolar diffus (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrations containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropsy for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, it has been demonstrated that the pathogenic T cells secreted by GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of secret IL-6 inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lyphosic infiltrates were also reported in necropsia.
WHO published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the polymerase chain through reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or cataract sample may be used.
The results are usually available within hours up to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but for this, two blood samples must be collected with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and publish their genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independently, response tests in the polymerase chain (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
Since April 4, 2020, anti-body tests (which may detect active infections and if a person was infected in the past) have been in development, but have not been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is from 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in multilobar bilateral fosco multilobar with peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural domain, mosaic flooring (sects thickensed with variable alveolar coating) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 physiopathology.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumonia hyperplasia, major atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffusion alveolar (DAD) damage with exudation of diffusion alveolar.
DAD is caused by acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
pneumonia treated: organisation of exudes in alveolare cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: dissociated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoitroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infections include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with soap and water by, at least 20 seconds, practicing a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tossing or breathing lens, as well as touching the mouth with the inside of the cotovule if the lens is not available.
Suitable hand hygiene after touching or breathing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of bread masks in public places, in part to limit the transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aimed at reducing contact of people infected with large groups when schools and workplaces are closed, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
The directions of the distance also include that people stay at least 1.8 metres (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective medicine for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the tip of the epidemic, also known as "screaming".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are obviously soft, before eating and after drying the nose, tossing or breathing.
It also recommends the use of antiseptic for hands the alcohol base with at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where antisseptics for commercial hands are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is given by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "a active substance for the aspsychiatry of the hands".
Glycerol is added as a lubricant.
People are treated with palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporate membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those people with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalised with COVID-19.
U.S. intensive doctors and pneumologists gathered recommendations for the treatment of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamine) instead of ibuprofen for use in the first line.
Caution is needed to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being carried out that may cause aerosols, such as intubate and manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with insulation of air infections (SIIA) as well as taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI butter, respiratory or facial mask, visual protection and medical needles. When available, it is preferable to use respiratory instead of facial masks.
N95 respiratorys are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised masks to be used under Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-prescribed uses.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of facial scarves or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most of the cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flux nasal channel or positive pressure on airways at two levels.
If one of these two brings the same benefits to people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the aerosol particles to spread, compared to the high flow nasal channel. Severe cases are more common in elderly (those above 60 years and, especially, above 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with the recurring scale in the number of cases of COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive therapy units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were, possibly, taken to the ITI.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as the acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with high pressure control and PEEP levels are required to increase oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of pulmonary lesions and pneumotorax associated with ventilation.
A high level of PEEP may not be available in older fans.
The potential treatment study began in January 2020 and clinical trials have been conducted with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines can stay until 2021 to be developed, several of the tested drugs have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced test phase.
Antiviral medication may be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation for the use of plasma of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person's life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies have not yet been performed to demonstrate their safety and efficacy against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
It is requested that users report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "next contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends the quarantine as well as alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of cell phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data from people who are suspected of having coronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect people who can contact infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who buys the Queen.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulia Gallera, said that he had been informed by cell operators that "40% of the people are still traveling this way".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton at the end of the week with more than 42 thousand participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in the quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said: "The increase in social isolation, solidarity, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis is a perfect pace to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild evolution, with little or no symptoms, seemingly other common diseases of higher respiratory tract, such as cold.
High cases are usually recovered within two weeks, as those with severe or critical illness can take from three to six weeks to recover.
pregnant women may have a greater risk of serious infection of COVID-19, according to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but lack of COVID-19 data. In some people, COVID-19 may affect lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most seriously affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to adult respiratory angina syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically increases in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients in patients with COVID-19, as renal failure was seen in 4% of the group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average occurrence of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ITU had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, as women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of samples after lung death show spread alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudes in the two lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image examination looked like a syndrome of acute respiratory discomfort (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was detected.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of hospitalised people had pre-existing comorbidities, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
The mortality estimates for comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Subnotification of mild cases may make the mortality rate underestimated.
However, the fact that the deaths will be the result of cases committed in the past can mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smoking was 1.4 times more convenient to have serious symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more suitable to require intensive treatment or to die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised regarding long-term cycles of disease.
The hospital authority in Hong Kong verified a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage in the organ.
This can also lead to post-intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
By March 2020, it was not known whether infections had given effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases were reported where the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin by means of transboundary infection.
The real source is unknown, but since December 2019 the spread of infection has become almost entirely driven by human transmission.
A study with the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the oldest date of the occurrence of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the oldest date of the occurrence of symptoms as of 8 December 2019.
Various measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and with time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time spent from the initial source and population characteristics such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO awarded the CID-10 emergency sickness codes U07.1 for deaths arising from infection by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratory and U07.2 for deaths by COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without infection by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given period of time.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall interest rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of mortality per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying from a disease, and the rate of mortality per infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and are accompanied by a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the east epicenter of Italy, Castiglioone d'Adda, a small population of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally registered as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had died by COVID-19 confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the range of 50 years, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between sex are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and development by men of comorbidity as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to the greater mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men, and 72% of the deaths by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sexual infections by COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, mainly nurses, are women, and they have more opportunities to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is of "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", of disease and "19" is since the sudden was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g.: China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the international nomination recommendations to prevent stigmatizations. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19-based virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and " acute respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV" as internal names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidelines against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngous sacraments and respiratory parts.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respiratory valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it to the necessary chronograph, a local startup made reverse engineering and printed the 100 needed valves one day to the other.
After the initial source of COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, misinformation and disinformation arose regarding the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, cats and rabbits.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International studies on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 are in progress in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers want to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immunological response from the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this study focuses on the protein of the mirror that helps the virus to enter the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
A third strategy is the nuclear acid vaccines (dNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an indefensive genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. The anti-corporate improvement was identified as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but that is contrary.
There are more than 300 clinical trials in progress since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatment already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydrochloric acid or chlorquin.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists mostly of Chinese studies, with nine clinical trials in phase III of redesign in several countries due to a report of the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was ongoing in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment with COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorocine and hydrochloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of redesign since March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remDesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquina, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for parental review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, warns that the good dose is highly dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydrochloroquine and chloroquine as criteria for physicians treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxinide was recommended to be more studied in vivo after having demonstrated low levels of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial spleen in preparation for serum transmembranar protease 2 (TMPRSSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydrochloric acid with or without azitromic have significant limitations that prevented the medical community from adopting these further studies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The temperature of cytokine may be a complication in the later stages of COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-temperature properties. Tocilzumabe was included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-racial test is under way in phase 2 of the national level in Italy, after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood examination to identify cytokine temperatures, these developments are expected to neutralize, which are considered to be the cause of the death of some affected people.
The antagonist of the interleukin-6 receptor was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of refraternal cytokines syndrome to steroids caused by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumabe is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immunological system from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vacinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with endless results.
The viral neutralisation is the mechanism of action expected by which passive anti-corporate therapy may measure a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or fagotosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, use manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Convalescent sodium production, consisting of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
